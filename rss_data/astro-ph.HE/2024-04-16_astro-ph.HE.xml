      <title>Emergence hour-by-hour of $r$-process features in the kilonova AT2017gfo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral features in the optical/near-infrared counterparts of neutron star mergers (kilonovae, KNe), evolve dramatically on hour timescales. To examine the spectral evolution we compile a temporal series complete at all observed epochs from 0.5 to 9.4 days of the best optical/near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the gravitational-wave detected kilonova AT2017gfo. Using our analysis of this spectral series, we show that the emergence times of spectral features place strong constraints on line identifications and ejecta properties, while their subsequent evolution probes the structure of the ejecta. We find that the most prominent spectral feature, the 1$\mathrm{\mu}$m P Cygni line, appears suddenly, with the earliest detection at 1.17 days. We find evidence in this earliest feature for the fastest kilonova ejecta component yet discovered, at 0.40-0.45$c$; while across the observed epochs and wavelengths, the velocities of the line-forming regions span nearly an order of magnitude, down to as low as 0.04-0.07$c$. The time of emergence closely follows the predictions for Sr II, due to the rapid recombination of Sr III under local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions. The time of transition between the doubly and singly ionised states provides the first direct measurement of the ionisation temperature, This temperature is highly consistent, at the level of a few percent, with the temperature of the emitted blackbody radiation field. Further, we find the KN to be isotropic in temperature, i.e. the polar and equatorial ejecta differ by less than a few hundred Kelvin or within 5%, in the first few days post-merger, based on measurements of the reverberation time-delay effect. This suggests that a model with very simple assumptions, with single-temperature LTE conditions, reproduces the early kilonova properties surprisingly well.</description>

      <title>The Snake's Beating Heart? A Millisecond Pulsar Binary in the Galactic Center Radio Filament G359.1$-$0.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center radio filament G359.0$-$0.2, often referred to as the ''Snake'', displays two notable kinks that cause its linear structure to deviate from running perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Using Murriyang, the 64 m Parkes radio telescope, we conducted a search for pulsars centered on the position of a previously identified compact radio and X-ray source in the major kink. We discovered a millisecond pulsar (MSP), PSR J1744$-$2946, with a period $P = 8.4$ ms, a dispersion measure of $673.7 \pm 0.1$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and Faraday rotation measure of $3011 \pm 3$ rad m$^{-2}$. Its radio pulses are only moderately scattered due to multi-path propagation through the interstellar medium, with a scattering timescale of $0.87 \pm 0.08$ ms at 2.6 GHz. The pulsar is bound in a 4.8 hr circular orbit around a $M_{\rm c} &gt; 0.05$ M$_{\odot}$ companion. Our discovery of the first MSP within 1$^{\circ}$ of the Galactic Center hints at a large population of these objects detectable via high frequency surveys. The potential association with the Snake points toward pulsars as the energy source responsible for illuminating Galactic Center radio filaments.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray variability and multi-wavelength insights into the unprecedented outburst from 4C 31.03</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blazar 4C 31.03 recently underwent a major gamma-ray outburst at the beginning of 2023 after a prolonged quiescent phase. Fermi-LAT reported a daily average flux of 5x10^-6 phs cm^-2 s^-1, which is about 60 times its average value. We investigated this extraordinary outbreak through temporal and multi-wavelength analysis. From the statistical analysis of the gamma-ray lightcurves using Bayesian blocks, we identified 3 epochs of prominent flares. The fastest flux decay during this major outburst was observed within 5.5 +/- 0.7 hours. The highest energy of gamma-ray photons found from the source during the active phase is ~ 82 GeV. Using the transparency of gamma-rays against pair production and light crossing time argument, we could obtain the minimum jet Doppler factor as 17 corresponding to the flaring state.The broadband spectral energy distribution study performed using synchrotron, SSC and EC emission processes supports the external Compton scattering of IR photons as the likely mechanism for the gamma-ray emission from the source. The results of this study suggest the scenario of the emission region in 4C 31.03, being located beyond the Broad-line region from the central blackhole. Long-term gamma-ray flux distribution of 4C 31.03 depicts a double log-normal variability, indicating that two distinct flux states are active in this energy band. The index distribution also reveals a two distinct variability patterns, suggesting that the gamma-ray spectrum can be more precisely described by two photon indices.</description>

      <title>Constraining Near-Simultaneous Radio Emission from Short Gamma-ray Bursts using CHIME/FRB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Project to search for FRBs that are temporally and spatially coincident with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) occurring between 2018 July 7 and 2023 August 3. We do not find any temporal (within 1 week) and spatial (within overlapping 3 sigma localization regions) coincidences between any CHIME/FRB candidates and all GRBs with 1 sigma localization uncertainties &lt;1 deg. As such, we use CHIME/FRB to constrain the possible FRB-like radio emission for 27 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) that were within 17 deg. of CHIME/FRB's meridian at a point either 6 hrs prior up to 12 hrs after the high-energy emission. Two SGRBs, GRB 210909A and GRB 230208A, were above the horizon at CHIME at the time of their high-energy emission and we place some of the first constraints on simultaneous FRB-like radio emission from SGRBs. While neither of these two SGRBs have known redshifts, we construct a redshift range for each GRB based on their high-energy fluence and a derived SGRB energy distribution. For GRB 210909A, this redshift range corresponds to z = [0.009, 1.64] with a mean of z=0.13. Thus, for GRB 210909A, we constrain the radio luminosity at the time of the high-energy emission to L &lt;2 x 10e46 erg s-1, L &lt; 5 x 10e44 erg s-1, and L &lt; 3 x 10e42 erg s-1 assuming redshifts of z=0.85, z=0.16, and z=0.013, respectively. We compare these constraints with the predicted simultaneous radio luminosities from different compact object merger models.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Electromagnetic Emission of Newborn Magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally recognized that the electromagnetic multipolar emission from magnetars can be used to explain radiation from Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) or Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs), but they have little impact on the spindown of magnetars. We here present a comprehensive analytical solution for the neutron star multipolar electromagnetic fields and their associated expected luminosities. We find that for newborn millisecond magnetars, the spin-down luminosity from higher multipolar components can match or even exceed that from the dipole component. Such high-intensity radiation will undoubtedly affect related astrophysical phenomena at the birth of a magnetar. We show that the spin-down luminosity from multipoles can well explain the majority of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) afterglows, from the plateau starting at several hundred seconds till the normal decay phase lasting for many years. The fitted magnetar parameters for GRB afterglows are all typical values, with spins in the millisecond range and magnetic field strengths in the order of $10^{14} - 10^{15}$ Gauss. Our results in turn, provide support for the hypothesis that GRBs originate from the birth of magnetars with a few millisecond period, thus deepening our understanding of the complex magnetic field structure and the equation of state of magnetars.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical evolution of the asteroid belt in a massive star-neutron star binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some fast radio bursts (FRBs) exhibit repetitive behaviors and their origins remain enigmatic. It has been argued that repeating FRBs could be produced by the interaction between a neutron star and an asteroid belt. Here we consider the systems in which an asteroid belt dwells around a massive star, while a neutron star, as a companion of the massive star, interacts with the belt through gravitational force. Various orbital configurations are assumed for the system. Direct N-body simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of the asteroids belt. It is found that a larger orbital eccentricity of the neutron star will destroy the belt more quickly, with a large number of asteroids being scattered out of the system. A non-zero mutual inclination angle suppresses the ejection rate of asteroids, but it also leads to a reduction in the collision rate of asteroids with the neutron star since many asteroids are essentially scattered into the 3D space. Among the various configurations, a clear periodicity is observed in the collision events for the case with an orbital eccentricity of 0.7 and mutual inclination of $0^{\circ}$. It is found that such a periodicity can be sustained for at least 8 neutron star orbital periods, supporting this mechanism as a possible explanation for periodically repeating FRBs. Our studies also suggest that the active stage of these kinds of FRB sources should be limited, since the asteroid belt would finally be destroyed by the neutron star after multiple passages.</description>

      <title>Eddington envelopes: The fate of stars on parabolic orbits tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars falling too close to massive black holes in the centres of galaxies can be torn apart by the strong tidal forces. Simulating the subsequent feeding of the black hole with disrupted material has proved challenging because of the range of timescales involved. Here we report a set of simulations that capture the relativistic disruption of the star, followed by one year of evolution of the returning debris stream. These reveal the formation of an expanding asymmetric bubble of material extending to hundreds of astronomical units -- an Eddington envelope with an optically thick inner region. Such envelopes have been hypothesised as the reprocessing layer needed to explain optical/UV emission in tidal disruption events, but never produced self-consistently in a simulation. Our model broadly matches the observed light curves with low temperatures, faint luminosities, and line widths of 10,000--20,000 km/s.</description>

      <title>Polarized radio emission of RRAT J1854+0306</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized radio emission of RRAT J1854+0306 is investigated with single pulses using FAST. Its emission is characterized by nulls, narrow and weak pulses and occasional wide and intense bursts with a nulling fraction of 53.2%. Its burst emission is typically of one rotation, and occasionally of two or three or even 5 rotations at the most, but without significant periodicity. The integrated pulse profile has a `S' shaped position angle curve that is superposed with orthogonal modes, from which geometry parameters are obtained. Individual pulses exhibit diverse profile morphology with single, double or multiple peaks. The intensity and width of these pulses are highly correlated, and bright pulses generally have wide profiles with multiple peaks. These nulling behaviours, profile morphology and polarization demonstrate that RRAT has the same physical origins as the normal pulsars.</description>

      <title>Binary microlensing by high eccentric stellar-mass black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensing is one of the most promising tools for discovering stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in the Milky Way because it allows us to probe dark or faint celestial compact objects. While the existence of stellar-mass BHs has been confirmed through observation of X-ray binaries within our galaxy and gravitational waves from extragalactic BH binaries, a conclusive observation of microlensing events caused by Galactic BH binaries has yet to be achieved. In this study, we focus on those with high eccentricity, including unbound orbits, which can dynamically form in star clusters and could potentially increase the observation rate. We demonstrate parameter estimation for simulated light curves supposing various orbital configurations of BH binary lenses. We employ a model-based fitting using the Nelder-Mead method and Bayesian inference based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for the demonstration. The results show that we can retrieve true values of the parameters of high eccentric BH binary lenses within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty of inferred values. We conclude it is feasible to find high eccentric Galactic BH binaries from the observation of binary microlensing events.</description>

      <title>Detection of simultaneous QPO triplets in 4U 1728-34 and constraining the neutron star mass and moment of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report simultaneous detection of twin kHz and $\sim 40$ Hz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the time-resolved analysis of the AstroSat/LAXPC observation of the neutron star low mass X-ray binary, 4U 1728-34. The frequencies of the multiple sets of triplets are correlated with each other and are consistent with their identification as the orbital, periastron and twice the nodal precessions frequencies. The observed relations, along with the known spin of the neutron star, put constraints on the mass and the ratio of moment of inertia to the mass of the neutron star to be $M^*_\odot = 1.92\pm 0.01$ and $I_{45}/M^*_\odot = 1.07\pm 0.01$ under the simplistic assumption that the metric is a Kerr one. We crudely estimate that the mass and moment of inertia values obtained may differ by about 1 % and 5 %, respectively, if a self-consistent metric is invoked. Using the TOV equations for computing the moment of inertia of a neutron star in slow rotation approximation, having different equations of state, we find that the predicted values of neutron star parameters favor stiffer equations of state. We expect more stringent constraints would be obtained using a more detailed treatment, where the EOS-dependent metric is used to compute the expected frequencies rather than the Kerr metric used here. The results provide insight into both the nature of these QPOs and the neutron star interior.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Sound Speed in Nuclear Matter: A Harmonious Interplay of Transport Calculation and Perturbative QCD Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very recently, it has been shown that there is an upper bound on the squared sound speed of nuclear matter from the transport, which reads $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ \citep{2024arXiv240214085H}. In this work, we demonstrate that this upper bound is corroborated by the reconstructed equation of state (EOS) for ultra-dense matter. The reconstruction integrates multi-messenger observation for neutron stars (NSs), as well as the theoretical constraints, including that from chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). In particular, the latest radius measurements for PSR J0437-4715 ($11.36^{+0.95}_{-0.63}$ km) and PSR J0030+0451 ($11.71^{+0.88}_{-0.83}$ km, in the ST+PDT model) by NICER have been adopted. The result shows in all cases, the $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ upper limit for EOS will naturally yield the properties of matter near center of the massive neutron star consistent with the causality-driven constraint from pQCD, where in practice, the constraint is applied at ten nuclear saturation density ($n_{\rm L}=10n_{\rm s}$). We also note that there is a strong correlation for the maximum square of sound speed $c_s^2$ with $n_{\rm L}$, and $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ is somehow violated when $n_{\rm L} = n_{\rm c,TOV}$. The result indicates that a higher density in implementing the pQCD constraint, even considering the uncertainties from statistics, is more natural. Moreover, the remarkable agreement between the outcomes derived from these two distinct and independent constraints (i.e., the transport calculation and pQCD boundary) lends strong support to their validity.</description>

      <title>The turbulent variability of accretion discs observed at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerical stochastic-viscous hydrodynamic simulations and new analytical results from thin disc theory to probe the turbulent variability of accretion flows, as observed at high energies. We show that the act of observing accretion discs in the Wien tail exponentially enhances small-scale temperature variability in the flow, which in a real disc will be driven by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, to large amplitude luminosity fluctuations (as predicted analytically). In particular, we demonstrate that discs with more spatially coherent turbulence (as might be expected of thicker discs), and relativistic discs observed at larger inclinations, show significantly enhancement in their Wien-tail variability. We believe this is the first analysis of relativistic viewing-angle effects on turbulent variability in the literature. Using these results we argue that tidal disruption events represent particularly interesting systems with which to study accretion flow variability, and may in fact be the best astrophysical probes of small scale disc turbulence. This is a result of a typical tidal disruption event disc being naturally observed in the Wien-tail and likely having a somewhat thicker disc and cleaner X-ray spectrum than other sources. We argue for dedicated X-ray observational campaigns of tidal disruption events, with the aim of studying accretion flow variability.</description>

      <title>Spectro-polarimetric study of a newly discovered Galactic transient Swift J151857.0-572147 using IXPE and NuSTAR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectro-polarimetric properties of a newly discovered black hole X-ray binary Swift\,J151857.0-572147 jointly using {\it IXPE} and {\it NuSTAR} observations during March 2024. The analysis of {\it IXPE} data reports mode-independent polarization degree (PD) $1.34\pm0.27$ and polarization angle (PA) $-13.69^\circ\pm5.85^\circ$, while the model-dependent analysis gives PD $1.18\pm0.23$ and PA $-14.01^\circ\pm5.80^\circ$. The joint spectral analysis of the broadband data constrains the average mass of the central black hole $\sim 8.5\pm1.3 M_\odot$ and a moderate spin parameter of $\sim0.6\pm0.1$ with disk inclination $\sim 31^\circ\pm8^\circ$. The power-law photon index and cutoff energy are $2.4\pm0.1$ and $\sim 50\pm9-60\pm8$ keV, suggesting a transition to the soft spectral state of the source during the observation period. Additionally, the best-fitted halo mass accretion is less compared to the disk mass accretion rate and a relatively lower corona size of 10 r$_g$ might be indicative of the same spectral state. The mass outflow rate was also low ($&lt;2$\% $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$) during these epochs. The hydrogen column density obtained from the fit is relatively high $\sim 5.2\pm0.1\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

Abstract: The continuously expanding sample of gravitational-wave observations is revealing the formation and evolutionary mechanism of merging compact binaries. Two primary channels, namely, isolated field binary evolution and dynamical capture, are widely accepted as potential producers of merging binary black holes (BBHs), which are distinguishable with the spin-orientation distributions of the BBHs. We investigate the two formation channels in GWTC-3, with a dedicated semi-parametric population model, i.e., a mixture of two sub-populations with different spin-orientation distributions (one is nearly-aligned and the other is nearly-isotropic). It turns out that the two sub-populations have different mass and mass-ratio distributions. The nearly-aligned sub-population, which is consistent with the isolated field formation channels, has a less preference for symmetric systems, and likely dominate the 10-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. While the isotropic sub-population shows a stronger preference for symmetric systems, and mainly contribute to the 35-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function, consistent with the dynamical channels. Moreover, our results show that the purely isotropic-spin and the single well-aligned (i.e., the width of $\cos\theta$ distribution $\sigma_{\rm t}&lt;0.5$) scenario are ruled out (by a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B}=5.2$ and $\ln\mathcal{B}=9.8$).</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Modeling for the Shallow Decay Phase of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the emission in the shallow decay phase of gamma-ray burst afterglows using a time-dependent code. We test four models: the energy injection model, evolving the injection efficiency of non-thermal electrons, evolving the amplification of the magnetic field, and the wind model with a relatively low bulk Lorentz factor. All of the four models can reproduce the typical X-ray afterglow lightcurve. The spectral shape depends on not only the parameter values at the time corresponding to the observer time but also the past evolution of the parameters. The model differences appear in the evolution of the broadband spectrum, especially in the inverse Compton component. Future gamma-ray observations with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as CTA will reveal the mechanism of the shallow decay phase.</description>

      <title>On the inefficiency of particle re-acceleration mechanisms in the cores of massive stellar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider scenarios for non-thermal particle acceleration and re-acceleration in the central cores of compact massive star clusters, aided by insights from high resolution hydrodynamic simulations. We show that i) particles are unlikely to interact with many shocks during their lifetimes in the core; ii) colliding flows do not produce hard spectra; iii) turbulent re-acceleration in the core is suppressed. Inefficient re-acceleration mechanisms are not expected to produce hard components nor to increase the maximum energy within the cores of massive star clusters. Models in which the observed ultra-high energy gamma rays originate in the core of massive stellar clusters are thus disfavoured.</description>

      <title>Effects of Superradiance in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) provides room for the elusive ultra-light scalar particles (ULSP) to be produced through a phenomenon called \textit{superradiance}. As a result of this phenomenon, a cloud of scalar particles forms around the black hole by draining the spin angular momentum of the SMBH. In this work, we present a study of the superradiant instability due to a scalar field in the vicinity of the central SMBH in an AGN. We begin by showing that the time-evolution of the gravitational coupling $\alpha$ in a realistic ambiance created by the accretion disk around the SMBH in AGN leads to interesting consequences such as the amplified growth of the scalar cloud, enhancement of the gravitational wave emission rate, and appearance of higher modes of superradiance within the age of the Universe ($\sim 10^{10}$ years). We then explore the consequence of superradiance on the characteristics of the AGN. Using the Novikov-Thorne model for an accretion disk, we divide the full spectrum into three distinct wavelength bands- X-ray ($10^{-4}-10^{-2}~\mu$m), UV (0.010-0.4~$\mu$m), and Vis-IR (0.4~$\mu$m-100~$\mu$m) and observe sudden drops in the time-variations of the luminosities across these bands and Eddington ratio ($f_{\textrm{Edd}}$) with a characteristic timescale of superradiance. Using a uniform distribution of spin and mass of the SMBHs in AGNs, we demonstrate the appearance of depleted regions and accumulations along the boundaries of these regions in the planes of different band-luminosities and $f_{\textrm{Edd}}$. Finally, we discuss some possible signatures of superradiance that can be drawn from the observed time-variation of the AGN luminosities.</description>

      <title>Development of a data overflow protection system for Super-Kamiokande to maximize data from nearby supernovae</title>

Abstract: Neutrinos from very nearby supernovae, such as Betelgeuse, are expected to generate more than ten million events over 10\,s in Super-Kamokande (SK). At such large event rates, the buffers of the SK analog-to-digital conversion board (QBEE) will overflow, causing random loss of data that is critical for understanding the dynamics of the supernova explosion mechanism. In order to solve this problem, two new DAQ modules were developed to aid in the observation of very nearby supernovae. The first of these, the SN module, is designed to save only the number of hit PMTs during a supernova burst and the second, the Veto module, prescales the high rate neutrino events to prevent the QBEE from overflowing based on information from the SN module. In the event of a very nearby supernova, these modules allow SK to reconstruct the time evolution of the neutrino event rate from beginning to end using both QBEE and SN module data. This paper presents the development and testing of these modules together with an analysis of supernova-like data generated with a flashing laser diode. We demonstrate that the Veto module successfully prevents DAQ overflows for Betelgeuse-like supernovae as well as the long-term stability of the new modules. During normal running the Veto module is found to issue DAQ vetos a few times per month resulting in a total dead time less than 1\,ms, and does not influence ordinary operations. Additionally, using simulation data we find that supernovae closer than 800~pc will trigger Veto module resulting in a prescaling of the observed neutrino data.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes captured by neutron stars: relativistic point-mass treatment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), if they exist, may collide with and be captured by neutron stars. We adopt a relativistic point-mass approximation to study this capture, the subsequent confinement of the PBH of mass $m$ inside the neutron star of mass $M_* \gg m$, and the PBH's growth by accretion of stellar material. Building on earlier treatments we systematically study the capture, confinement, and accretion process, characterize the emitted quasiperiodic continuous gravitational-wave signal, track the evolution of the PBH's orbital parameters, and compare the effects of different choices for the prescription of the dissipative forces. Our point-mass treatment here is applicable in the limit of small PBH masses, for which its effects on the neutron star can be ignored.</description>

      <title>The Population of Massive Stars in AGN Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational instability in the outskirts of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks lead to disk fragmentation and formation of super-massive (several 10^2Msun) stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex-situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged due to recycling of hydrogen rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched towards smaller radii resembling a classical star-burst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses of \sim 10^6 to 10^8Msun accreting at \sim 0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 10^3 to 10^5 coexisting massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10^-3 to 1 per year. We motivate the detailed study of interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.</description>

      <title>Transient Classifiers for Fink: Benchmarks for LSST</title>

Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to detect a few million transients per night, which will generate a live alert stream during the entire 10 years of the survey. This will be distributed via community brokers whose task is to select subsets of the stream and direct them to scientific communities. Given the volume and complexity of data, machine learning (ML) algorithms will be paramount for this task. We present the infrastructure tests and classification methods developed within the {\sc Fink} broker in preparation for LSST. This work aims to provide detailed information regarding the underlying assumptions, and methods, behind each classifier, enabling users to make informed follow-up decisions from {\sc Fink} photometric classifications. Using simulated data from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), we showcase the performance of binary and multi-class ML classifiers available in {\sc Fink}. These include tree-based classifiers coupled with tailored feature extraction strategies, as well as deep learning algorithms. We introduce the CBPF Alert Transient Search (CATS), a deep learning architecture specifically designed for this task. Results show that {\sc Fink} classifiers are able to handle the extra complexity which is expected from LSST data. CATS achieved $97\%$ accuracy on a multi-class classification while our best performing binary classifier achieve $99\%$ when classifying the Periodic class. ELAsTiCC was an important milestone in preparing {\sc Fink} infrastructure to deal with LSST-like data. Our results demonstrate that {\sc Fink} classifiers are well prepared for the arrival of the new stream; this experience also highlights that transitioning from current infrastructures to Rubin will require significant adaptation of currently available tools.</description>

Abstract: To describe the dark side of the Universe, we adopt a novel approach where dark energy is explained as an electrically charged majority of dark matter. Dark energy, as such, does not exist. The Friedmann equation at the present time coincides with that in a conventional approach, although the cosmological "constant" in the Electromagnetic Accelerating Universe (EAU) Model shares a time dependence with the matter component. Its equation of state is $\omega \equiv P/\rho \equiv -1$ within observational accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now: both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the early epoch of the evolution. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this contribution. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary epoch and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of GUP distortion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion disks around compact stars are formed due to turbulence driven by magnetorotational instability. Despite over thirty years of numerous computational studies on magnetorotational turbulence, the properties of fluctuations in the inertial range -- where cross-scale energy transfer dominates over energy injection -- have remained elusive, primarily due to insufficient numerical resolution. Here, we report the highest-resolution simulation of magnetorotational turbulence ever conducted. Our simulations reveal a constant cross-scale energy flux, a hallmark of the inertial range. We found that as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the inertial range, the kinetic and magnetic energies tend toward equipartitioning with the same spectral slope, and slow-magnetosonic fluctuations dominate over Alfv\'enic fluctuations, possessing twice the energy. These findings align remarkably with the theoretical expectations from the reduced magnetohydrodynamic model, which assumes a near-azimuthal mean magnetic field. Our results provide important implications for interpreting the radio observations by the Event Horizon Telescope.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron-skin thickness and neutron-star observables based on effective nuclear interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have obtained the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy from neutron-skin thickness data by parity-violating electron scatterings and neutron-star observables using a Bayesian approach, based on the standard Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model and its extension as well as the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. While the neutron-skin thickness data (neutron-star observables) mostly constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation (suprasaturation) densities, they may more or less constrain the behavior of the symmetry energy at suprasaturation (subsaturation) densities, depending on the energy-density functional form. Besides showing the final posterior density dependence of the symmetry energy, we also compare the slope parameters of the symmetry energy at 0.10 fm$^{-3}$ as well as the values of the symmetry energy at twice saturation density from three effective nuclear interactions. The present work serves as a comparison study based on relativistic and nonrelativistic energy-density functionals for constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from low to high densities using a Bayesian approach.</description>

      <title>Measuring a gravitomagentic effect with the triple pulsar PSR J0337+1715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the first post--Newtonian order, the orbital angular momentum of the fast--revolving inner binary of the triple system PSR J0337+1715, made of a millisecond pulsar and a white dwarf, induces an annular gravitomagnetic field which displaces the line of apsides of the slower orbit of the other, distant white dwarf by $-1.2$ milliarcseconds per year. The current accuracy in determining the periastron of the outer orbit is $63.9$ milliarcseconds after 1.38 years of data collection. By hypothesizing a constant rate of measurement of the pulsar's times of arrivals over the next 10 years, assumed equal to the present one, it can be argued that the periastron will be finally known to a $\simeq 0.15$ milliarcseconds level, while its cumulative gravitomagnetic retrograde shift will be as large as $-12$ milliarcseconds. The competing post--Newtonian gravitolectric periastron advance due to the inner binary's masses, nominally amounting to $74.3$ milliarcseconds per year, can be presently modelled to an accuracy level as good as $\simeq 0.04$ milliarcseconds per year. The mismodelling in the much larger Newtonian periastron rate due to the quadrupolar term of the multipolar expansion of the gravitational potential of a massive ring, whose nominal size for PSR J0337+1715 is $0.17$ degrees per year, might be reduced down to the $\simeq 0.5$ milliarcseconds per year level over the next 10 years. Thus, a first measurement of such a novel form of gravitomagnetism, although challenging, may be somehow feasible in a not too distant future.</description>

      <title>The NICER data and a $\sigma$-field dependent stiffness of the hadronic equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyses for the NICER data indicate that there is no significant variation of the compact star radii within the mass range of 1.4 to 2.0 solar masses. Yamamoto et al. [Phys. Rev. C 108, 035811 (2023)] concluded recently that ``this feature cannot be reproduced by the hadronic matter due to the softening of the equation of state (EoS) by hyperon mixing, suggesting the possible existence of quark phases in neutron-star interiors.'' Using a collection of 162 purely nucleonic, hyperonic, and quarkish EoSs from CompOSE database and some other works, we verify that hyperons indeed lead to a significant difference in radii of stars of 1.4 and 2.0 solar masses, which diminishes in the presence of quarks. We compare the shapes of the mass-radius curves and show that hyperons and quarks in the neutron star cores prefer a particular curve shape with backbending. It is argued that the shape {is controlled by the density dependence} of the nuclear symmetry energy. We draw attention to the existence of a class of purely hadronic relativistic mean-field EoSs with scalar-field dependent hadron masses and coupling constants that satisfy the known constraints on the EoSs including the analyses of the new NICER data and the above requirement of no significant variation of the neutron star radii.</description>

      <title>Combined Pre-Supernova Alert System with Kamland and Super-Kamiokande</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preceding a core-collapse supernova, various processes produce an increasing amount of neutrinos of all flavors characterized by mounting energies from the interior of massive stars. Among them, the electron antineutrinos are potentially detectable by terrestrial neutrino experiments such as KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande via inverse beta decay interactions. Once these pre-supernova neutrinos are observed, an early warning of the upcoming core-collapse supernova can be provided. In light of this, KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande have been monitoring pre-supernova neutrinos since 2015 and 2021, respectively. Recently, we performed a joint study between KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande on pre-supernova neutrino detection. A pre-supernova alert system combining the KamLAND detector and the Super-Kamiokande detector is developed and put into operation, which can provide a supernova alert to the astrophysics community. Fully leveraging the complementary properties of these two detectors, the combined alert is expected to resolve a pre-supernova neutrino signal from a 15 M$_{\odot}$ star within 510 pc of the Earth, at a significance level corresponding to a false alarm rate of no more than 1 per century. For a Betelgeuse-like model with optimistic parameters, it can provide early warnings up to 12 hours in advance.</description>

      <title>Bounds from multi-messenger astronomy on the Super Heavy Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: The purely gravitational evidence supporting the need for dark matter (DM) particles is compelling and based on Galactic to cosmological scale observations. Thus far, the promising weakly interacting massive particles scenarios have eluded detection, motivating alternative models for DM. We consider the scenarios involving the superheavy dark matter (SHDM) that potentially can be emitted by primordial black holes (PBHs) and can decay or annihilate into ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrinos and photons. The observation of a population of photons with energies $E\ge 10^{11}$ GeV would imply the existence of completely new physical phenomena, or shed some light on DM models. Only the ultra-high energy cosmic ray observatories have the capabilities to detect such UHE decay products via the measurements of UHE photon induced extensive air showers. Using the upper bound on the flux of UHE cosmic rays beyond $10^{11.3}$ GeV implying $J(&gt;10^{11.3}~{\rm{GeV}})&lt; 3.6\times 10^{-5}$ km$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$y$^{-1}$, at the $90\%$ C.L. reported by the Pierre Auger Observatory, we obtain global limits on the lifetime of the DM particles with masses $10^{15}\le M_{X} \le 10^{17}$ GeV. The constraints derived here are new and cover a region of the parameter space not yet explored. We compare our results with the projected constraints from future POEMMA and JEM-EUSO experiments, in order to quantify the improvement that will be obtained by these missions.
  Moreover, assuming that an epoch of early PBHs domination introduces a unique spectral break, $f_{\ast}$, in the gravitational wave spectrum, the frequency of which is related to the SHDM mass, we map potential probes and limits of the DM particles masses on the $f_{\ast}-M_{X}$ parameter space.</description>

      <title>Resolving the stellar-collapse and hierarchical-merger origins of the coalescing black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin and mass properties provide essential clues in distinguishing the origins of coalescing black holes (BHs). With a dedicated semi-parametric population model for the coalescing binary black holes (BBHs), we identify two distinct categories of BHs among the GWTC-3 events, which is {favored over the one population scenario by} a logarithmic Bayes factor ($\ln\mathcal{B}$) of 7.5. One category, with a mass ranging from $\sim 25M_\odot$ to $\sim 80M_\odot$, is distinguished by the high spin-magnitudes ($\sim0.75$) and consistent with the hierarchical merger origin. The other category, characterized by low spins, has a sharp mass cutoff at $\sim 40M_\odot$, which is natural for the stellar-collapse origin and in particular the pair-instability explosion of massive stars. We infer the local hierarchical merger rate density as $0.46^{+0.61}_{-0.24}~{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. Additionally, we find that a fraction of the BBHs has a cosine-spin-tilt-angle distribution concentrated preferentially around $1$, which is consistent with the expectation of the isolated field binaries and the dynamically formed BBHs in the accretion disks of Active Galactic Nuclei.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality in the Temporal Occurrence of Repeating FRBs</title>

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are energetic phenomena that have significant implications for understanding fundamental physics and the universe. Recent observations of FRB 121102, FRB 20220912A, and FRB 20201124A by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) showed high burst rates and distinctive energy distribution and temporal properties. In this study, we examine these observations to investigate the scale invariance of the waiting times between bursts for intervals longer than approximately 1 second. Our analysis revealed a unified scaling law for these longer intervals, which is similar to the behavior of solar flares. This discovery inspires us to suggest a dual analogy of the FRB scenario across the entire time intervals: with earthquake dynamics at subsecond scales and with solar flare dynamics beyond the one-second threshold. This threshold potentially aligns with the dynamic time scale of neutron star crusts, offering insight of the occurrence of FRBs into the internal processes of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A Search for AGN sources of the IceCube Diffuse Neutrino Flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux measured by the IceCube Observatory remains largely unknown. Although NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 have been identified as potential neutrino sources, the diffuse flux of neutrinos must have additional sources that have not yet been identified. Here we investigate potential correlations between IceCube's neutrino events and the Fermi and MOJAVE source catalogs, using the publicly-available IceCube data set. We perform three separate spatially-dependent, energy-dependent, and time-dependent searches, and find no statistically significant sources outside of NGC 1068. We find that no more than 13% of IceCube's neutrino flux originates from blazars over the whole sky. Then, using an energy-dependent likelihood analysis, the limit on neutrinos originating from blazars reduces to 9% in the Northern hemisphere. Finally, we set limits on individual sources from the MOJAVE radio catalog after finding no statistically significant time-flaring sources.</description>

      <title>Do Neutrinos Become Flavor Unstable Due to Collisions with Matter in the Supernova Decoupling Region?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In core-collapse supernovae, the neutrino density is so large that neutrino flavor instabilities, leading to flavor conversion, can be triggered by the forward scattering of neutrinos among each other, if a crossing between the angular distributions of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos exists (fast instability in the limit of vanishing vacuum frequency) or in the presence of perturbations induced by the neutrino vacuum frequency (slow instability). Recently, it has been advanced the conjecture that neutrino collisions with the medium could be another mean to kickstart flavor change (collisional instability). Inspired by a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with mass $18.6\ M_\odot$, we compute the neutrino angular distributions solving the kinetic equations for an average energy mode and investigate the occurrence of flavor instabilities at different post-bounce times, ranging from the accretion phase to the early cooling phase. We find that fast and slow flavor instabilities largely dominate over the collisional ones in the decoupling region for all post-bounce times. While more work is needed to assess the relevance of collisional instabilities in neutrino-dense environments, our findings suggest that neutrino collisions with matter affect the flavor evolution in the decoupling region, but are not responsible for triggering flavor conversion, if crossings in the neutrino lepton number angular distribution exist.</description>

      <title>The Early Ultraviolet Light-Curves of Type II Supernovae and the Radii of Their Progenitor Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sample of 34 normal SNe II detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility, with multi-band UV light-curves starting at $t \leq 4$ days after explosion, as well as X-ray detections and upper limits. We characterize the early UV-optical colors and provide prescriptions for empirical host-extinction corrections. We show that the $t &gt; 2\,$days UV-optical colors and the blackbody evolution of the sample are consistent with the predictions of spherical phase shock-cooling (SC), independently of the presence of `flash ionization" features. We present a framework for fitting SC models which can reproduce the parameters of a set of multi-group simulations without a significant bias up to 20% in radius and velocity. Observations of about half of the SNe II in the sample are well-fit by models with breakout radii $&lt;10^{14}\,$cm. The other half are typically more luminous, with observations from day 1 onward that are better fit by a model with a large $&gt;10^{14}\,$cm breakout radius. However, these fits predict an early rise during the first day that is too slow. We suggest these large-breakout events are explosions of stars with an inflated envelope or a confined CSM with a steep density profile, at which breakout occurs. Using the X-ray data, we derive constraints on the extended ($\sim10^{15}$ cm) CSM density independent of spectral modeling, and find most SNe II progenitors lose $&lt;10^{-4} M_{\odot}\, \rm yr^{-1}$ a few years before explosion. This provides independent evidence the CSM around many SNe II progenitors is confined. We show that the overall observed breakout radius distribution is skewed to higher radii due to a luminosity bias. We argue that the $66^{+11}_{-22}\%$ of red supergiants (RSG) explode as SNe II with breakout radii consistent with the observed distribution of field RSG, with a tail extending to large radii, likely due to the presence of CSM.</description>

      <title>Study of Galactic interactions and propagation properties of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays using the precision spectrum from the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AUGER Collaboration has recently published the precise energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 1 EeV, which exhibits rich and interesting features. These features provide an opportunity to investigate the galactic propagation and interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). While the classic dip model, which describes the UHECR propagation and interaction with CMB in extragalactic space by theoretical calculation, well explains the cutoff behaviour of the highest high energy spectrum of AUGER, it fails to describe the low energy features. It indicates that the galactic propagation and interaction of UHECR might play an important role in modulating the low energy side of AUGER spectrum. With the disk-halo diffusion model, this work demonstrates excellent agreement with the energy spectrum measured by AUGER and supports that the diffusion coefficient follows a power-law with an index of $1.81^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in the galaxy at least above $5\times10^{18}$eV. The inferred diffusion coefficient is one to two order of magnitude smaller than these extrapolated from low energy studies when conventional model parameters are adopted. Study of the modulation effect at cluster of galaxy level might be needed.</description>

      <title>Linear to circular conversion in the polarized radio emission of a magnetar</title>

Abstract: Radio emission from magnetars provides a unique probe of the relativistic, magnetized plasma within the near-field environment of these ultra-magnetic neutron stars. The transmitted waves can undergo birefringent and dispersive propagation effects that result in frequency-dependent conversions of linear to circularly polarized radiation and vice-versa, thus necessitating classification when relating the measured polarization to the intrinsic properties of neutron star and fast radio burst (FRB) emission sites. We report the detection of such behavior in 0.7-4 GHz observations of the P = 5.54 s radio magnetar XTE J1810$-$197 following its 2018 outburst. The phenomenon is restricted to a narrow range of pulse phase centered around the magnetic meridian. Its temporal evolution is closely coupled to large-scale variations in magnetic topology that originate from either plastic motion of an active region on the magnetar surface or free precession of the neutron star crust. Our model of the effect deviates from simple theoretical expectations for radio waves propagating through a magnetized plasma. Birefringent self-coupling between the transmitted wave modes, line-of-sight variations in the magnetic field direction and differences in particle charge or energy distributions above the magnetic pole are explored as possible explanations. We discuss potential links between the immediate magneto-ionic environments of magnetars and those of FRB progenitors.</description>

      <title>Testing an exact diffraction formula with gravitational wave source lensed by a supermassive black hole in binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When it comes to long-wavelength gravitational waves (GWs), diffraction effect becomes significant when these waves are lensed by celestial bodies. Typically, the traditional diffraction integral formula neglects large-angle diffraction, which is often adequate for most of cases. Nonetheless, there are specific scenarios, such as when a GW source is lensed by a supermassive black hole in a binary system, where the lens and source are in close proximity, where large-angle diffraction can play a crucial role. In our prior research, we have introduced an exact, general diffraction integral formula that accounts for large-angle diffraction as well. This paper explores the disparities between this exact diffraction formula and the traditional, approximate one under various special conditions. Our findings indicate that, under specific parameters, such as a lens-source distance of $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$\,AU and a lens mass of $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$, the amplification factor for the exact diffraction formula is notably smaller than that of the approximate formula, differing by a factor of approximately $r_F\simeq0.806$. This difference is substantial enough to be detectable. Furthermore, our study reveals that the proportionality factor $r_F$ gradually increases from 0.5 to 1 as $D_{\rm LS}$ increases, and decreases as $M_{\rm L}$ increases. Significant differences between the exact and approximate formulas are observable when $D_{\rm LS}\lesssim0.2$ AU (assuming $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$) or when $M_{\rm L}\gtrsim2\times10^6M_\odot$ (assuming $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU). These findings suggest that there is potential to validate our general diffraction formula through future GW detections.</description>

      <title>Search for dormant black holes in the OGLE data</title>

Abstract: Light curves of ellipsoidal variables collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) were analyzed, in order to search for dormant black hole candidates. After the preselection based on the amplitude of ellipsoidal modulation, each object was investigated by means of the spectral energy distribution fit, which allowed us to select objects that are in close agreement with the spectrum of a single stellar object. After this final step of the preselection process, we were left with only fourteen objects that were then investigated in detail. For each candidate, we estimated basic physical parameters such as temperature, mass, luminosity, and, in some cases, radial velocity semi-amplitude. One of the objects turned out to be a spotted star while the rest are considered black-hole binary candidates. In the end, we present an alternative explanation for the ellipsoidal modulation in the form of contact binaries, which are not only vast in number, contrary to black-hole binaries, but are also in much better agreement with the radial velocity estimates for some of the systems analyzed. Even if the presented arguments suggest a noncompact character of the companion objects, each of them should be observed spectroscopically in order to verify the compact object hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Minimalist model of the W50/SS433 "Extended X-ray Jet": anisotropic wind with recollimation shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: W50 is a radio nebula around hyper-accreting Galactic microquasar SS~433. Here we focus on one peculiar feature of W50 - a pair of so-called "extended X-ray jets" (EXJs). These "jets" have a size of $\sim20\, {\rm pc}$, a sharp inner boundary, and their spectra are well represented by a featureless X-ray continuum. We argue that EXJ could be an outcome of a powerful {\it anisotropic} wind produced by a super-critical accretion disk. In the simplest version of this model, the wind itself consists of two components. The first component is a nearly isotropic outflow that subtends most of the solid angle as seen from the compact source and creates the quasi-spherical part of the W50 nebula. The second component is a more collimated wind aligned with the binary system rotation axis (polar wind). The isotropic outflow passes through the termination shock and its increased thermal pressure creates a sequence of recollimation shocks in the polar wind, giving it the appearance of an extended X-ray structure. In this model, the EXJ continuum spectrum is due to synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated at the shocks arising in the polar wind. At variance with many other studies, in this model, the EXJ structures are not directly related to the highly collimated and precessing $0.26\;\!c$ baryonic jets. Instead, the EXJ and the W50's ears are produced by the part of the wind with an Eddington-level kinetic luminosity confined to a half-opening angle of 5-10 degrees, which is not necessarily a recollimated version of the $0.26\;\!c$ jets.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations of the Ultraluminous source NGC 4190 ULX-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an X-ray analysis of three different XMM-Newton observations together with simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 4190 ULX-1. Our goal is to constrain the structure of the accretion disk and the geometrical properties of the source. We performed a temporal and spectral analyses in the 0.4--30 keV energy range where the source is significantly detected in dedicated XMM-Newton, NICER and NuSTAR observations. The temporal analysis shows no flaring activity in the light curves. No pulsation is detected throughout. The source exhibits a typical ULX spectrum, which can be fitted with two thermal blackbody components plus a Comptonization tail at high energies. The luminosity-temperature relation of each thermal spectral component is consistent with the $L \propto T^{2}$ relation expected from an advection-dominated supercritical disk. We interpret these results as a super-Eddington accreting black hole seen almost face-on. A dense wind ejected from the disk obscures the central source, and a hot electron plasma is evacuated through the funnel formed above the hole. Geometric beaming is responsible for the ULX soft emission, whereas the hard tail is the result of Comptonization of soft photons by the electrons ejected through the funnel.</description>

      <title>On the association of GW190425 with its potential electromagnetic counterpart FRB 20190425A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Moroianu et al. (2022) has suggested that the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW190425 might have a potential fast radio burst (FRB) counterpart association, FRB 20190425A, at the 2.8$\sigma$ level of confidence with a likely host galaxy association, namely UGC10667. The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a long-lived hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that formed promptly after the BNS merger and was stable for approximately 2.5 hours before promptly collapsing into a black hole. Recently, Bhardwaj et al. (2023) conclusively associated FRB 20190425A with UGC10667, potentially providing a direct host galaxy candidate for GW190425. In this work, we examine the multi-messenger association based on the space-time localization overlaps between GW190425 and the FRB host galaxy UGC10667 and find that the odds for a coincident association are $\mathcal{O}(5)$. We validate this estimate by using a Gaussian Process (GP) density estimator. Assuming that the association is indeed real, we then perform Bayesian parameter estimation on GW190425 assuming that the BNS event took place in \GAL. We find that the viewing angle of GW190425 excludes an on-axis system at $p(\theta_v&gt;30^o)\approx99.99$\%, highly favouring an off-axis system similar to GRB 170817A. We also find a slightly higher source frame total mass for the binary, namely, $m_{\rm{total}} = 3.42^{+0.34}_{-0.11} M_{\odot}$, leading to an increase on the probability of prompt collapse into a black hole and therefore disfavors the long-lived HMNS formation scenario. Given our findings, we conclude that the association between \GW and \FRB is disfavoured by current state-of-the-art gravitational-wave analyses.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the gamma-ray counterpart from nova FM Cir with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the analysis results of X-ray and gamma-ray data of the nova FM Cir taken by Swift and Fermi-LAT. The gamma-ray emission from FM Cir can be identified with a significance level of 3sigma within 40 days after the nova eruption (2018 January 19) while we bin the light curve per day. The significance can further exceed 4 sigma confidence level if we accumulate longer time (i.e., 20 days) to bin the light curve. The gamma-ray counterpart could be identified with a Test Statistic (TS) above 4 until 180 days after the eruption. The duration of the gamma-ray detection was longer than those reported in the previous studies of the other novae detected in the GeV range. The significant X-ray emission was observed after the gamma-ray flux level fell below the sensitivity of Fermi-LAT. The hardness ratio of the X-ray emission decreased rapidly with time, and the spectra were dominated by blackbody radiation from the hot white dwarf. Except for the longer duration of the gamma-ray emission, the multi-wavelength properties of FM Cir closely resemble those of other novae detected in the GeV range.</description>

      <title>Vortex Effects in Merging Black Holes and Saturons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vorticity has recently been suggested to be a property of highly-spinning black holes. The connection between vorticity and limiting spin represents a universal feature shared by objects of maximal microstate entropy, so-called saturons. Using $Q$-ball-like saturons as a laboratory for black holes, we study the collision of two such objects and find that vorticity can have a large impact on the emitted radiation as well as on the charge and angular momentum of the final configuration. As black holes belong to the class of saturons, we expect that the formation of vortices can cause similar effects in black hole mergers, leading to macroscopic deviations in gravitational radiation. This could leave unique signatures detectable with upcoming gravitational-wave searches, which can thereby serve as a portal to macroscopic quantum effects in black holes.</description>

      <title>How I wonder where you are: pinpointing coalescing binary neutron star sources with the IGWN, including LIGO-Aundha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LIGO-Aundha (A1), the Indian gravitational wave detector, is expected to join the IGWN and begin operations in the early 2030s. We study the impact of A1 on the accuracy of determining the direction of incoming transient signals from coalescing BNS sources with moderately high SNRs. It is conceivable that A1's sensitivity, effective bandwidth, and duty cycle will improve incrementally through multiple detector commissioning rounds to achieve the desired `LIGO-A+' design sensitivity. For this purpose, we examine A1 under two distinct noise PSDs. One mirrors the conditions during the O4 run of the LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors, simulating an early commissioning stage, while the other represents the A+ design sensitivity. We consider various duty cycles of A1 at the sensitivities mentioned above for a comprehensive analysis. We show that even at the O4 sensitivity with a modest $20\%$ duty cycle, A1's addition to the IGWN leads to a $15\%$ reduction in median sky-localization errors ($\Delta \Omega_{90\%}$) to $5.6$~sq.~deg. At its design sensitivity and $80\%$ duty cycle, this error shrinks further to $2.4$~sq.~deg, with 84\% sources localized within a nominal error box of $10$~sq.~deg! Even in the worst-case scenario, where signals are sub-threshold in A1, we demonstrate its critical role in reducing the localization uncertainties of the BNS source. Our results are obtained from a large Bayesian PE study using simulated signals injected in a heterogeneous network of detectors using the recently developed meshfree approximation aided rapid Bayesian inference pipeline. We consider a seismic cut-off frequency of 10 Hz for all the detectors. We also present hypothetical improvements in sky localization for a few GWTC-like events injected in real data and demonstrate A1's role in resolving the degeneracy between the luminosity distance and inclination angle parameters.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative study of quantum many-body correlation effects in neutron stars: Equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although neutron stars have been studied for decades, their internal structure remains enigmatic, mainly due to large uncertainties in the equation of state. In neutron stars, nucleons are strongly interacting by exchanging mesons, which leads to significant quantum many-body correlation effects. Previous mean-field calculations failed to capture these effects. Here, we develop a non-perturbative quantum field-theoretic approach to handle strongly correlated nuclear matters. Based on a linear $\sigma$-$\omega$-$\rho$ model with a density-dependent isovector coupling $\Gamma_{\rho}$, we reproduce all the six frequently-used nuclear matter observables by tuning six parameters. After including quantum many-body effects into the equation of state of realistic neutron-star matters, we obtain a mass-radius relation that is in good agreement with recent astrophysical observations. Our results show that the maximal neutron-star mass supported by neutron-dominated matters is $\sim 2.67M_{\odot}$, where $M_{\odot}$ is solar mass.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Group Merger Origin of the Cloverleaf Odd Radio Circle System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Odd radio circles (ORCs) are a newly discovered class of extended faint radio sources of unknown origin. We report the first detection of diffuse X-ray gas at the location of a low-redshift ORC (z=0.046) known as Cloverleaf ORC. This observation was performed with the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. The physical extent of the diffuse X-ray emission corresponds to a region of approximately 230 kpc by 160 kpc, lying perpendicular to the radio emission detected by ASKAP. The X-ray spectrum shows characteristics of thermal multiphase gas with temperatures of 1.10+/-0.08 keV and 0.22+/-0.01 keV and a central density of $(4.9\pm0.6)\times10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating that the Cloverleaf ORC resides in a low-mass galaxy group. Using X-ray observations, with hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermal assumptions, we measure the galaxy group to have a gas mass and a total mass of $(7.7\pm 0.8) \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\rm sun}$ and $2.6\pm0.3\times10^{13}$~$M_{\rm sun}$ within the overdensity radius R$_{500}$. The presence of a high-velocity subgroup identified in optical data, the orientation of the brightest cluster galaxy, the disturbed morphologies of galaxies toward the east of the Cloverleaf ORC, and the irregular morphology of the X-ray emission suggest that this system is undergoing a galaxy group merger. The radio power of the ORC could be explained by the shock reacceleration of fossil cosmic rays generated by a previous episode of black hole activity in the central active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>
