      <title>A Strong Gravitational Lens Is Worth a Thousand Dark Matter Halos: Inference on Small-Scale Structure Using Sequential Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses are a singular probe of the universe's small-scale structure $\unicode{x2013}$ they are sensitive to the gravitational effects of low-mass $(&lt;10^{10} M_\odot)$ halos even without a luminous counterpart. Recent strong-lensing analyses of dark matter structure rely on simulation-based inference (SBI). Modern SBI methods, which leverage neural networks as density estimators, have shown promise in extracting the halo-population signal. However, it is unclear whether the constraining power of these models has been limited by the methodology or the information content of the data. In this study, we introduce an accelerator-optimized simulation pipeline that can generate lens images with realistic subhalo populations in a matter of milliseconds. Leveraging this simulator, we identify the main methodological limitation of our fiducial SBI analysis: training set size. We then adopt a sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) approach, allowing us to iteratively refine the distribution of simulated training images to better align with the observed data. Using only one-fifth as many mock Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, SNPE matches the constraints on the low-mass halo population produced by our best non-sequential model. Our experiments suggest that an over three order-of-magnitude increase in training set size and GPU hours would be required to achieve an equivalent result without sequential methods. While the full potential of the existing strong lens sample remains to be explored, the notable improvement in constraining power enabled by our sequential approach highlights that the current constraints are limited primarily by methodology and not the data itself. Moreover, our results emphasize the need to treat training set generation and model optimization as interconnected stages of any cosmological analysis using simulation-based inference techniques.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution on the Spectral and Spatial Anisotropy of Nano-Hertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open question in the field of modern cosmology. The detection of nanohertz (n-Hz) gravitational waves via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the form of individual events and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) offers a promising avenue for studying SMBH formation across cosmic time, with SGWB signal being the immediately detectable signal with the currently accessible telescope sensitivities. By connecting the galaxy properties in the large scale (Gpc scale) cosmological simulation such as \texttt{MICECAT} with the small scale ($\sim$ Mpc scale) galaxy simulations from \texttt{ROMULUS}, we show that different scenarios of galaxy--SMBHs evolution with redshift leads to a frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy in the SGWB signal. The presence of slow evolution of the SMBHs in the Universe leads to a pronounced blue anisotropic spectrum of the SGWB. In contrast, if SMBHs grow faster in the Universe in lighter galaxies, the frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy exhibits a more flattened anisotropic spectrum. This additional aspect of the SGWB signal on top of the monopole SGWB signal, can give insight on how the SMBHs form in the high redshift Universe and its interplay with the galaxy formation from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Vanilla Inflation Predicts Negative Running</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the simplest, and currently favoured, theoretical realizations of cosmic inflation yield a sharp prediction for the running of the spectral index $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$. Using latest cosmological data, we compute its marginalized posterior probability distribution over the space of nearly 300 models of single-field slow-roll inflation. The most probable value is $\alpha_\mathrm{S}=-6.3 \times 10^{-4}$, lying within the $98\%$ credible interval $-1.8 \times 10^{-3}&lt; \alpha_\mathrm{S}&lt; -9.1 \times 10^{-5}$. Within the landscape of all the proposed slow-roll inflationary models, positive values for the running are therefore disfavoured at more than three-sigma.</description>

      <title>Dark Radiation with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI 2024 and the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, contributing to the effective number of neutrinos $N_\text{eff}$, as $\Delta N_\text{eff}\equiv N_\text{eff}-3.044\geq 0$, in light of the recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the DESI collaboration. We analyze one-parameter extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model where dark radiation (DR) is free streaming or behaves as a perfect fluid, due to self-interactions. We report a significant relaxation of upper bounds on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, with respect to previous BAO data from SDSS+6dFGS, when additionally employing Planck data (and supernovae data from Pantheon+), setting $\Delta N_\text{eff}\leq 0.39$ ($95\%$ C.L.) for free streaming DR, and a very mild preference for fluid DR, $\Delta N_\text{eff} = 0.221^{+0.088}_{-0.18}$ ($\leq 0.46$, $95\%$ C.L.). Applying constraints from primordial element abundances leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, but they are avoided if DR is produced after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For fluid DR we estimate the tension with the SH$_0$ES determination of $H_0$ to be around $(2.3-2.8)\sigma$ level, and for free-streaming DR the tension is below $3\sigma$ if production occurs after BBN. This lesser degree of tension motivates a combination with SH$_0$ES in these cases, resulting in a $4.4\sigma-5\sigma$ evidence for dark radiation with $\Delta N_\text{eff}\simeq 0.6$ and large improvements in $\chi^2$ over $\Lambda$CDM, $-18\lesssim \Delta \chi^2\lesssim -25$.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dark Energy after DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models characterized by an energy-momentum flow from Dark Matter to Dark Energy. By combining Planck-2018 and DESI data, we observe a preference for interactions exceeding the 95% confidence level, yielding a present-day expansion rate $H_0=71.4\pm1.5$ km/s/Mpc, in agreement with SH0ES. This preference remains robust when including measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$ obtained from the relative ages of massive, early-time, and passively-evolving galaxies, as well as when considering distance moduli measurements from Type-Ia Supernovae sourced from the Pantheon-plus catalog using the SH0ES Cepheid host distances as calibrators. Overall, high and low redshift data can be equally or better explained within the IDE framework compared to $\Lambda$CDM, while also yielding higher values of $H_0$ in better agreement with the local distance ladder estimate.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. III. A Census of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the third Data Release (DR3) of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, a spectroscopic survey characterizing satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. The SAGA Survey DR3 includes 378 satellites identified across 101 MW-mass systems in the distance range 25-40.75 Mpc, and an accompanying redshift catalog of background galaxies (including about 46,000 taken by SAGA) in the SAGA footprint of 84.7 sq. deg. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to 13, in the stellar mass range 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses. Based on a detailed completeness model, this sample accounts for 94% of the true satellite population down to a stellar mass of 10^7.5 solar masses. We find that the mass of the most massive satellite in SAGA systems is the strongest predictor of satellite abundance; one-third of the SAGA systems contain LMC-mass satellites, and they tend to have more satellites than the MW. The SAGA satellite radial distribution is less concentrated than the MW, and the SAGA quenched fraction below 10^8.5 solar masses is lower than the MW, but in both cases, the MW is within 1 sigma of SAGA system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellites do not exhibit a clear corotating signal as has been suggested in the MW/M31 satellite systems. Although the MW differs in many respects from the typical SAGA system, these differences can be reconciled if the MW is an older, slightly less massive host with a recently accreted LMC/SMC system.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. IV. The Star Formation Properties of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the star-forming properties of 378 satellite galaxies around 101 Milky Way analogs in the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, focusing on the environmental processes that suppress or quench star formation. In the SAGA stellar mass range of 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses, we present quenched fractions, star-forming rates, gas-phase metallicities, and gas content. The fraction of SAGA satellites that are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass and shows significant system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellite quenched fractions are highest in the central 100 kpc of their hosts and decline out to the virial radius. Splitting by specific star formation rate (sSFR), the least star-forming satellite quartile follows the radial trend of the quenched population. The median sSFR of star-forming satellites increases with decreasing stellar mass and is roughly constant with projected radius. Star-forming SAGA satellites are consistent with the star formation rate-stellar mass relationship determined in the Local Volume, while the median gas-phase metallicity is higher and median HI gas mass is lower at all stellar masses. We investigate the dependence of the satellite quenched fraction on host properties. Quenched fractions are higher in systems with higher host halo mass, but this trend is only seen in the inner 100 kpc; systems with a massive neighbor within 2.5 Mpc show higher quenched fractions at all radii. Our results suggest that lower mass satellites and satellites inside 100 kpc are more efficiently quenched in a Milky Way-like environment, with these processes acting sufficiently slowly to preserve a population of star-forming satellites at all stellar masses and projected radii.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. V. Modeling Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies with Updated UniverseMachine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environment plays a critical role in shaping the assembly of low-mass galaxies. Here, we use the UniverseMachine (UM) galaxy-halo connection framework and the Data Release 3 of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey to place dwarf galaxy star formation and quenching into a cosmological context. UM is a data-driven forward model that flexibly parameterizes galaxy star formation rates (SFR) using only halo mass and assembly history. We add a new quenching model to UM, tailored for galaxies with stellar masses $\lesssim 10^9$ solar masses, and constrain the model down to a stellar mass $\gtrsim 10^7$ solar masses using new SAGA observations of 101 satellite systems around Milky Way (MW)-mass hosts and a sample of isolated field galaxies in a similar mass range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The new best-fit model, 'UM-SAGA,' reproduces the satellite stellar mass functions, average SFRs, and quenched fractions in SAGA satellites while keeping isolated dwarfs mostly star forming. The enhanced quenching in satellites relative to isolated field galaxies leads the model to maximally rely on halo assembly to explain the observed environmental quenching. Extrapolating the model down to a stellar mass $\sim 10^{6.5}$ solar masses yields a quenched fraction of $\gtrsim$ 30% for isolated field galaxies and $\gtrsim$ 80% for satellites of MW-mass hosts at this stellar mass. This specific prediction can soon be tested by spectroscopic surveys to reveal the relative importance of internal feedback, cessation of mass and gas accretion, satellite-specific gas processes, and reionization for the evolution of faint low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Inflaton decay in No-Scale Supergravity and Starobinsky-like models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the decay of the inflaton in Starobinsky-like models arising from either an $R+R^2$ theory of gravity or $N=1$ no-scale supergravity models. If Standard Model matter is simply introduced to the $R + R^2$ theory, the inflaton (which appears when the theory is conformally transformed to the Einstein frame) couples to matter predominantly in Standard Model Higgs kinetic terms. This will typically lead to a reheating temperature of $\sim 3 \times 10^9$~GeV. However, if the Standard Model Higgs is conformally coupled to curvature, the decay rate may be suppressed and vanishes for a conformal coupling $\xi = 1/6$. Nevertheless, inflaton decays through the conformal anomaly leading to a reheating temperature of order $10^8$~GeV. The Starobinsky potential may also arise in no-scale supergravity. In this case, the inflaton decays if there is a direct coupling of the inflaton to matter in the superpotential or to gauge fields through the gauge kinetic function. We also discuss the relation between the theories and demonstrate the correspondence between the no-scale models and the conformally coupled $R+R^2$ theory (with $\xi = 1/6$).</description>

      <title>Bring the Heat: Tidal Heating Constraints for Black Holes and Exotic Compact Objects from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first constraints on tidal heating for the binary systems detected in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave data. Tidal heating, also known as tidal dissipation, characterizes the viscous nature of an astrophysical body and provides a channel for exchanging energy and angular momentum with the tidal environment. Using the worldline effective field theory formalism, we introduce a physically motivated and easily interpretable parametrization of tidal heating valid for an arbitrary compact astrophysical object. We then derive the imprints of the spin-independent and linear-in-spin tidal heating effects of generic binary components on the waveform phases and amplitudes of quasi-circular orbits. Notably, the mass-weighted spin-independent tidal heating coefficient derived in this work, $\mathcal{H}_0$, is the dissipative analog of the tidal Love number. We constrain the tidal heating coefficients using the public LVK O1-O3 data. Our parameter estimation study includes two separate analyses: the first treats the catalog of binary events as binary black holes (BBH), while the second makes no assumption about the nature of the binary constituents and can therefore be interpreted as constraints for exotic compact objects. In the former case, we combine the posterior distributions of the individual BBH events and obtain a joint constraint of $-13 &lt; \mathcal{H}_0 &lt; 20$ at the $90\%$ credible interval for the BBH population. This translates into a bound on the fraction of the emitted gravitational wave energy lost due to tidal heating (or gained due to radiation enhancement effects) at $|\Delta E_H/\Delta E_{\infty}|\lesssim 3\cdot 10^{-3}$. Our work provides the first robust framework for deriving and measuring tidal heating effects in merging binary systems, demonstrating its potential as a powerful probe of the nature of binary constituents and tests of new physics.</description>

      <title>VLBI with SKA: Possible Arrays and Astrometric Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is stepping into the era of microarcsecond ($\mu$as) astronomy, and pushing astronomy, especially astrometry, to new heights. VLBI with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), SKA-VLBI, will increase current sensitivity by an order of magnitude, and reach astrometric precision routinely below 10 $\mu$as, even challenging 1 $\mu$as. This advancement allows precise parallax and proper motion measurements of various celestial objects. Such improvements can be used to study objects (including isolated objects, and binary or multiple systems) in different stellar stages (such as star formation, main-sequence stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, pulsars, black holes, white dwarfs, etc.), unveil the structure and evolution of complex systems (such as the Milky Way), benchmark the international celestial reference frame, and reveal cosmic expansion. Furthermore, the theory of general relativity can also be tested with SKA-VLBI using precise measurements of light deflection under the gravitational fields of different solar system objects and the perihelion precession of solar system objects.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric self-interacting dark matter with canonical seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of generating dark matter (DM) and baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) simultaneously in an asymmetric DM framework which also alleviates the small-scale structure issues of cold DM (CDM). While thermal relic of such self-interacting DM (SIDM) remains under-abundant due to efficient annihilation into light mediators, a non-zero asymmetry in dark sector can lead to survival of the required DM in the universe. The existence of a light mediator leads to the required self-interactions of DM at small scales while keeping DM properties similar to CDM at large scales. It also ensures that the symmetric DM component annihilates away, leaving the asymmetric part, in the spirit of cogenesis. The particle physics implementation is done in canonical seesaw models of light neutrino mass, connecting it to the origin of DM and BAU. In particular, we consider type-I and type-III seesaw origin of neutrino mass for simplicity and minimality of the field content. We show that the desired self-interactions and relic of DM together with BAU while satisfying relevant constraints lead to strict limits on DM mass $\mathcal{O}(\rm GeV) \lesssim M_{\rm DM} \lesssim460 $ GeV. In spite of being high scale seesaw, the models remain verifiable at different experiments including direct, indirect DM search as well as colliders.</description>

Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

Abstract: Aims: The origin of the seeds of galactic magnetic fields is a subject that remains under debate; here we will explore a new possible mechanism that could provide such seed from charge asymmetries in slowly rotating protogalaxies. Methods: We use current knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution to estimate that a charge imbalance of $1$ every $\sim10^{38\pm 5}$ charge carriers in slowly rotating protogalaxies can provide an alternative mechanism to produce such seeds. Results: The gravitationally induced charge imbalance within plasmas in hydrostatic equilibrium lies in the upper range of this estimation, and is higher than possible surviving primordial charge asymmetries. We conclude that this known, but unappreciated thermodynamic property of plasmas in gravitational fields, may have important cosmological consequences.</description>

      <title>The relation between the cool-core radius and the host galaxy clusters: thermodynamic properties and cluster mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of cool-core systems in a sample of four galaxy clusters (RXCJ1504.1-0248, A3112, A4059, and A478) using archival X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Cool cores are frequently observed at the centers of galaxy clusters and are considered to be formed by radiative cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM). Cool cores are characterized by a significant drop in the ICM temperature toward the cluster center. We extract and analyze X-ray spectra of the ICM to measure the radial profiles of the ICM thermodynamic properties including temperature, density, pressure, entropy, and radiative cooling time. We define the cool-core radius as the turnover radius in the ICM temperature profile and investigate the relation between the cool-core radius and the properties of the host galaxy clusters. In our sample, we observe that the radiative cooling time of the ICM at the cool-core radius exceeds 10 Gyr, with RXCJ1504.1-0248 exhibiting a radiative cooling time of $32^{+5}_{-11}$ Gyr at its cool-core radius. These results indicate that not only radiative cooling but also additional mechanisms such as gas sloshing may play an important role in determining the size of cool cores. Additionally, we find that the best-fit relation between the cool-core radius and the cluster mass ($M_{500}$) is consistent with a linear relation. Our findings suggest that cool cores are linked to the evolution of their host galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>First direction sensitive search for dark matter with a nuclear emulsion detector at a surface site</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained nuclear emulsion films have been developed as a tracking detector with nanometric spatial resolution to be used in direction-sensitive dark matter searches, thanks to novel readout technologies capable of exploiting this unprecedented resolution. Emulsion detectors are time insensitive. Therefore, a directional dark matter search with such detector requires the use of an equatorial telescope to absorb the Earth rotation effect. We have conducted for the first time a directional dark matter search in an unshielded location, at the sea level, by keeping an emulsion detector exposed for 39 days on an equatorial telescope mount. The observed angular distribution of the data collected during an exposure equivalent to 0.59 g days agrees with the background model and an exclusion plot was then derived in the dark matter mass and cross-section plane: cross-sections higher than $1.3 \times 10^{-28}$ cm$^{2}$ and $1.7 \times 10^{-31}$ cm$^2$ were excluded for a dark matter mass of $10$ GeV$/c^2$ and $100$ GeV$/c^2$, respectively. This is the first direction sensitive search for dark matter with a solid-state, particle tracking detector.</description>

      <title>Weighing neutrinos with Lyman-$\alpha$ observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of massive neutrinos has still not been revealed by the cosmological data. We consider a novel method based on the two-point line-of-sight correlation function of high-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data to achieve this end in the paper. We adopt semi-analytic models of Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds for the study. We employ Fisher matrix technique to show that it is possible to achieve a scenario in which the covariance of the two-point function nearly vanishes for both the spectroscopic noise and the signal. We analyze this near 'zero noise' outcome in detail to argue it might be possible to detect neutrinos of mass range $m_\nu \simeq 0.05 \hbox{--}0.1 \, \rm eV$ with signal-to-noise of unity with a single QSO line of sight. We show that this estimate can be improved to SNR $\simeq 3\hbox{--}6$ with data along multiple line of sights within the redshift range $z \simeq 2 \hbox{--} 2.5$. Such data sets already exist in the literature. We further carry out principal component analysis of the Fisher matrix to study the degeneracies of the neutrino mass with other parameters. We show that Planck priors lift the degeneracies between the neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters. However, the prospects of the detection of neutrino mass are driven by the poorly-determined parameters characterizing the ionization and thermal state of Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds.</description>

      <title>Multi-tracing the primordial Universe with future surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluctuations generated by Inflation are nearly Gaussian in the simplest models, but may be non-Gaussian in more complex models, potentially leading to signatures in the late Universe. In particular, local type primordial non-Gaussianity induces scale-dependent bias in tracers of the matter distribution. This non-Gaussian imprint in the tracer power spectrum survives at late times on ultra-large scales where nonlinearity is negligible. In order to combat the problem of growing cosmic variance on these scales, we use a multi-tracer analysis that combines different tracers to maximise any primordial signal. Previous work has investigated the combination of a spectroscopic galaxy survey with a 21cm intensity mapping survey in single-dish mode. We extend this work by considering instead the case where the 21cm intensity mapping survey is optimised for interferometer mode. As examples, we use two multi-tracer pairs of surveys: one at high redshift ($1 \le z \le 2$) and one at very high redshift ($2 \le z \le 5$). The 21cm surveys are idealised surveys based on HIRAX and PUMA. We implement foreground-avoidance filters and use detailed models of the interferometer thermal noise. The galaxy surveys are idealised surveys based on Euclid and MegaMapper. Via a simple Fisher forecast, we illustrate the potential of the multi-tracer. Our results show a $\sim 20 - 30\%$ improvement in precision on local primordial non-Gaussianity from the multi-tracer. Furthermore, we investigate the effects on constraints of varying the parameter of non-Gaussian galaxy assembly bias and of varying the parameters of the intensity mapping foreground filters. We find that the non-Gaussian galaxy assembly bias parameter causes a greater change in the constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity than the foreground filter parameters.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Prediction of the CSST Ultra Deep Field Type Ia Supernova Photometric Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) as a standard candle is an ideal tool to measure cosmic distance and expansion history of the Universe. Here we investigate the SN Ia photometric measurement in the China Space Station Telescope Ultra Deep Field (CSST-UDF) survey, and study the constraint power on the cosmological parameters, such as the equation of state of dark energy. The CSST-UDF survey is expected to cover a 9 deg$^2$ sky area in two years with 250 s $\times$ 60 exposures for each band. The magnitude limit can reach $i\simeq26$ AB mag for 5$\sigma$ point source detection with a single exposure. We generate light curve mock data for SNe Ia and different types of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). {\tt SNCosmo} is chosen as the framework by utilizing the SALT3 model to simulate SN Ia data. After selecting high-quality data and fitting the light curves, we derive the light curve parameters and identify CCSNe as contamination, resulting in $\sim2200$ SNe with a $\sim7\%$ CCSN contamination rate. We adopt a calibration method similar to Chauvenet's criterion, and apply it to the distance modulus data to further reduce the contamination. We find that this method is effective and can suppress the contamination fraction to $\sim3.5\%$ with 2012 SNe Ia and 73 CCSNe. In the cosmological fitting stage, we did not distinguish between SNe Ia and CCSNe. We find that the constraint accuracies on $\Omega_{\rm M}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and $w$ are about two times better than the current SN surveys, and it could be further improved by a factor of $\sim$1.4 if including the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the CSST spectroscopic wide-field galaxy survey.</description>

      <title>Using Rest-Frame Optical and NIR Data from the RAISIN Survey to Explore the Redshift Evolution of Dust Laws in SN Ia Host Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use rest-frame optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of 42 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Carnegie Supernova Project at low-$z$ and 37 from the RAISIN Survey at high-$z$ to investigate correlations between SN Ia host galaxy dust, host mass, and redshift. This is the first time the SN Ia host galaxy dust extinction law at high-$z$ has been estimated using combined optical and rest-frame NIR data ($YJ$-band). We use the BayeSN hierarchical model to leverage the data's wide rest-frame wavelength range (extending to $\sim$1.0-1.2 microns for the RAISIN sample at $0.2\lesssim z\lesssim0.6$). By contrasting the RAISIN and CSP data, we constrain the population distributions of the host dust $R_V$ parameter for both redshift ranges. We place a limit on the difference in population mean $R_V$ between RAISIN and CSP of $-1.16&lt;\Delta\mu(R_V)&lt;1.38$ with 95% posterior probability. For RAISIN we estimate $\mu(R_V)=2.58\pm0.57$, and constrain the population standard deviation to $\sigma(R_V)&lt;0.90~[2.42]$ at the 68 [95]% level. Given that we are only able to constrain the size of the low- to high-$z$ shift in $\mu(R_V)$ to $\lesssim1.4$ - which could still propagate to a substantial bias in the equation of state parameter $w$ - these and other recent results motivate continued effort to obtain rest-frame NIR data at low and high redshifts (e.g. using the Roman Space Telescope).</description>

      <title>Improved Treatment of Dark Matter Capture in Neutron Stars III: Nucleon and Exotic Targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.02525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the capture of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars via scattering on hadronic targets, including neutrons, protons and hyperons. We extend previous analyses by including momentum dependent form factors, which account for hadronic structure, and incorporating the effect of baryon strong interactions in the dense neutron star interior, rather than modelling the baryons as a free Fermi gas. The combination of these effects suppresses the DM capture rate over a wide mass range, thus increasing the cross section for which the capture rate saturates the geometric limit. In addition, variation in the capture rate associated with the choice of neutron star equation of state is reduced. For proton targets, the use of the interacting baryon approach to obtain the correct Fermi energy is essential for an accurate evaluation of the capture rate in the Pauli-blocked regime. For heavy neutron stars, which are expected to contain exotic matter, we identify cases where DM scattering on hyperons contributes significantly to the total capture rate. Despite smaller neutron star capture rates, compared to existing analyses, we find that the projected DM-nucleon scattering sensitivity greatly exceeds that of nuclear recoil experiments for a wide DM mass range.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Background: Gravitational Wave Anisotropy and Continuous Waves from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have found evidence for a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB). Assuming the GWB is produced by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), the next gravitational wave (GW) signals astronomers anticipate are Continuous Waves (CWs) from single SMBHBs and their associated GWB anisotropy. The prospects for detecting CWs and anisotropy are highly dependent on the astrophysics of SMBHB populations. Thus, information from single sources can break degeneracies in astrophysical models and place much more stringent constraints than the GWB alone. We simulate and evolve SMBHB populations, model their GWs, and calculate their anisotropy and detectability. We investigate how varying components of our semi-analytic model, including the galaxy stellar mass function, the SMBH--host galaxy relation ($M_\mathrm{BH}$--$M_\mathrm{bulge}$), and the binary evolution prescription impact the expected detections. The CW occurrence rate is greatest for few total binaries, high SMBHB masses, large scatter in $M_\mathrm{BH}$--$M_\mathrm{bulge}$, and long hardening times. The occurrence rate depends most on the binary evolution parameters, implying that CWs offer a novel avenue to probe binary evolution. The most detectable CW sources are in the lowest frequency bin for a 16.03-year PTA, have masses from $\sim\!\!10^9-10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$, and are $\sim\!\!1$ Gpc away. The level of anisotropy increases with frequency, with the angular power spectrum over multipole modes $\ell$ varying in low-frequency $C_{\ell&gt;0}/C_0$ from $\sim\!\!5\times 10^{-3}$ to $\sim\!\!2\times10^{-1}$, depending on the model; typical values are near current upper limits. Observing this anisotropy would support SMBHB models for the GWB over cosmological models, which tend to be isotropic.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: Unveiling the Role of Strong Ha-emitters during the Epoch of Reionization with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the ultra-deep \textit{JWST}/MIRI image at 5.6 $\mu m$ in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, we constrain the role of strong H$\alpha$-emitters (HAEs) during Cosmic Reionization at $z\simeq7-8$. Our sample of HAEs is comprised of young ($&lt;35\;\rm Myr$) galaxies, except for one single galaxy ($\approx 300\;\rm Myr$), with low stellar masses ($\lesssim 10^{9}\;\rm M_{\odot}$). These HAEs show a wide range of UV-$\beta$ slopes, with a median value of $\beta = -2.15\pm0.21$ which broadly correlates with stellar mass. We estimate the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{ion,0}$) of these sources (assuming $f_{esc,LyC} = 0\%$), which yields a median value $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion,0}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.50^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$. We show that $\xi_{ion,0}$ positively correlates with EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Instead $\xi_{ion,0}$ weakly anti-correlates with stellar mass and $\beta$. Based on the $\beta$ values, we predict $f_{esc, LyC}=4\%^{+3}_{-2}$, which results in $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.55^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$. Considering this and related findings from the literature, we find a mild evolution of $\xi_{ion}$with redshift. Additionally, our results suggest that these HAEs require only modest escape fractions ($f_{esc, rel}$) of 6$-$15\% to reionize their surrounding intergalactic medium. By only considering the contribution of these HAEs, we estimated their total ionizing emissivity ($\dot{N}_{ion}$) as $\dot{N}_{ion} = 10^{50.53 \pm 0.45}; \text{s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-3}$. When comparing their $\dot{N}_{ion}$ with "non-H$\alpha$ emitter" galaxies across the same redshift range, we find that that strong, young, and low-mass emitters may have played an important role during Cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Imprints on DM Halos: the concentration-mass relation and its dependence on halo and galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The halo concentration-mass relation has ubiquitous use in modeling the matter field for cosmological and astrophysical analyses, and including the imprints from galaxy formation physics is tantamount to its robust usage. Many analyses, however, probe the matter around halos selected by a given halo/galaxy property -- rather than by halo mass -- and the imprints under each selection choice can be different. We employ the CAMELS simulation suite to quantify the astrophysics and cosmology dependence of the concentration-mass relation, $c_{\rm vir}-M_{\rm vir}$, when selected on five properties: (i) velocity dispersion, (ii) formation time, (iii) halo spin, (iv) stellar mass, and (v) gas mass. We construct simulation-informed nonlinear models for all properties as a function of halo mass, redshift, and six cosmological/astrophysical parameters, with a mass range $M_{\rm vir} \in [10^{11}, 10^{14.5}] M_\odot/h$. There are many mass-dependent imprints in all halo properties, with clear connections across different properties and non-linear couplings between the parameters. Finally, we extract the $c_{\rm vir}-M_{\rm vir}$ relation for subsamples of halos that have scattered above/below the mean property-$M_{\rm vir}$ relation for a chosen property. Selections on gas mass or stellar mass have a significant impact on the astrophysics/cosmology dependence of $c_{\rm vir}$, while those on any of the other three properties have a significant (mild) impact on the cosmology (astrophysics) dependence. We show that ignoring such selection effects can lead to errors of $\approx 25\%$ in baryon imprint modelling of $c_{\rm vir}$. Our nonlinear model for all properties is made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming axions are potential dark matter (DM) candidate that make up all of the DM abundance, we discuss production of axions via (i) standard misalignment mechanism during the period of reheating and (ii) graviton-mediated 2-to-2 scattering of the inflaton and bath particles, where the inflaton $\phi$ oscillates in a monomial potential $V(\phi)\propto\phi^k$ with a general equation of state. Considering reheating takes place purely gravitationally, mediated by massless gravitons, we explore the viable region of the parameter space that agrees with the observed DM relic abundance, satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). We also discuss complementarity between dedicated axion search experiments and futuristic gravitational wave search facilities in probing the viable parameter space.</description>
