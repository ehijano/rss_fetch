      <title>Deciding Reachability in a Directed Graph given its Path Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciding if there exists a path from one vertex to another in a graph is known as the s-t connectivity or the reachability problem. Reachability can be solved using graph traversal algorithms like Depth First Search(DFS) or Breadth First Search(BFS) in linear time but these algorithms also take linear space. On the other hand, Savitch's algorithm solves the same problem using O(log^2 n) space but takes quasipolynomial time.
  A path decomposition P of a directed graph G is a collection of simple directed paths such that every edge of G lies on exactly one path in P. A minimal path decomposition of G is a path decomposition of G having the smallest number of paths possible and the number of paths in a minimal path decomposition of G is called the path number of G. We show that if a path decomposition P of a directed graph G consisting of k directed paths is provided, then reachability in G can be decided simultaneously in O(klog n) space and polynomial time. In fact, our result holds even when a walk decomposition is provided (instead of a path decomposition) where the graph is decomposed into k directed walks (instead of paths) and the walks are not necessarily edge-disjoint.
  We further show that a minimal path decomposition can be computed in logspace for directed acyclic graphs. This leads to the conclusion that reachability in directed acyclic graphs having bounded path number is logspace computable.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lov\'asz Local Lemma: Shearer's Bound is Tight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.07055v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz Local Lemma (LLL) is a very powerful tool in combinatorics and probability theory to show the possibility of avoiding all bad events under some weakly dependent conditions. In a seminal paper, Ambainis, Kempe, and Sattath (JACM 2012) introduced a quantum version LLL (QLLL) which shows the possibility of avoiding all ``bad" Hamiltonians under some weakly dependent condition, and applied QLLL to the random k-QSAT problem. Sattath, Morampudi, Laumann, and Moessner (PNAS 2015) extended Ambainis, Kempe, and Sattath's result and showed that Shearer's bound is a sufficient condition for QLLL, and conjectured that Shearer's bound is indeed the tight condition for QLLL.
  In this paper, we affirm this conjecture. Precisely, we prove that Shearer's bound is tight for QLLL, i.e., the relative dimension of the smallest satisfying subspace is completely characterized by the independent set polynomial. Our result implies the tightness of Gily\'en and Sattath's algorithm (FOCS 2017), and also implies that the lattice gas partition function fully characterizes quantum satisfiability for almost all Hamiltonians with large enough qudits (Sattath, Morampudi, Laumann and Moessner, PNAS 2015).
  The commuting LLL (CLLL), which focuses on commuting local Hamiltonians, is also investigated here. We prove that the tight regions of CLLL and QLLL are different in general. This result indicates that it is possible to design an algorithm for CLLL which is still efficient beyond Shearer's bound.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic and symbolic models of computation with advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems and physical models defined on idealized continuous phase spaces are known to exhibit non-computable phenomena, examples include the wave equation, recurrent neural networks, or Julia sets in holomorphic dynamics. Inspired by the works of Moore and Siegelmann, we show that ideal fluids, modeled by the Euler equations, are capable of simulating poly-time Turing machines with polynomial advice on compact three-dimensional domains. This is precisely the complexity class $P/poly$ considered by Siegelmann in her study of analog recurrent neural networks. In addition, we introduce a new class of symbolic systems, related to countably piecewise linear transformations of the unit square, that is capable of simulating Turing machines with advice in real-time, contrary to previously known models.</description>
