      <title>Fast Jet Finding in Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet reconstruction remains a critical task in the analysis of data from HEP colliders. We describe in this paper a new, highly performant, Julia package for jet reconstruction, JetReconstruction.jl, which integrates into the growing ecosystem of Julia packages for HEP. With this package users can run sequential reconstruction algorithms for jets. In particular, for LHC events, the Anti-${k}_\text{T}$, Cambridge/Aachen and Inclusive-${k}_\text{T}$ algorithms can be used. For FCCee studies the use of alternative algorithms such as the Generalised ${k}_\text{T}$ for $e^+e^-$ and Durham are also supported.
  The performance of the core algorithms is better than Fastjet's C++ implementation, for typical LHC and FCCee events, thanks to the Julia compiler's exploitation of single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD), as well as ergonomic compact data layouts.
  The full reconstruction history is made available, allowing inclusive and exclusive jets to be retrieved. The package also provides the means to visualise the reconstruction. Substructure algorithms have been added that allow advanced analysis techniques to be employed. The package can read event data from EDM4hep files and reconstruct jets from these directly, opening the door to FCCee and other future collider studies in Julia.</description>

      <title>TelePix2: Full scale fast region of interest trigger and timing for the EUDET-style telescopes at the DESY II Test Beam Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing demands by future and current upgrades of particle physics experiments on rate capabilities and time resolution, the requirements on test beams are also increasing. The current infrastructure at the DESY II test beam facility includes particle tracking telescopes with long integration times, no additional timing but excellent spatial resolution. This results in readouts with multiple particles per trigger, causing ambiguities in tracking and assigning particles to triggers. Also, it is likely not to trigger on particles that pass through a small device under test, leading to inefficient data taking. These issues can be solved by adding TelePix2 as a timing and flexible region of interest trigger layer. TelePix2 is a full scale HV-CMOS chip based on the successful small scale prototype TelePix. The DAQ system and the sensors performance featuring efficiencies above 99 % and a time resolution of 3.844(2) ns are presented. The integration into EUDAQ2 and the AIDA-TLU to seamlessly work in the test beam environment as well as into the analysis chain is described. First successful use cases are highlighted to conclude that TelePix2 is a well-suited timing and trigger layer for test beams</description>

      <title>Julia in HEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Julia is a mature general-purpose programming language, with a large ecosystem of libraries and more than 12000 third-party packages, which specifically targets scientific computing. As a language, Julia is as dynamic, interactive, and accessible as Python with NumPy, but achieves run-time performance on par with C/C++. In this paper, we describe the state of adoption of Julia in HEP, where momentum has been gathering over a number of years.
  HEP-oriented Julia packages can already, via UnROOT.jl, read HEP's major file formats, including TTree and RNTuple. Interfaces to some of HEP's major software packages, such as through Geant4.jl, are available too. Jet reconstruction algorithms in Julia show excellent performance. A number of full HEP analyses have been performed in Julia.
  We show how, as the support for HEP has matured, developments have benefited from Julia's core design choices, which makes reuse from and integration with other packages easy. In particular, libraries developed outside HEP for plotting, statistics, fitting, and scientific machine learning are extremely useful.
  We believe that the powerful combination of flexibility and speed, the wide selection of scientific programming tools, and support for all modern programming paradigms and tools, make Julia the ideal choice for a future language in HEP.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter via Charged Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark matter direct-detection strategy using charged particle decays at accelerator-based experiments. If ultralight $(m_\phi \ll \text{eV})$ dark matter has a misalignment abundance, its local field oscillates in time at a frequency set by its mass. If it also couples to flavor-changing neutral currents, rare exotic decays such as $\mu \to e \phi$ and $\tau\to e(\mu)\phi$ inherit this modulation. Focusing on such charged lepton flavor-violating decays, we show that sufficient event samples can enable detection of ultralight dark matter candidates at Mu3e, Belle-II, and FCC-ee.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses and mixing: Entering the era of subpercent precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an updated global analysis of the known and unknown parameters of the standard $3\nu$ framework as of 2025. The known oscillation parameters include three mixing angles $(\theta_{12},\,\theta_{23},\,\theta_{13})$ and two squared mass gaps, chosen as $\delta m^2=m^2_2-m^2_1&gt;0$ and $\Delta m^2=m^2_3-{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(m^2_1+m^2_2)$, where $\alpha=\mathrm{sign}(\Delta m^2)$ distinguishes normal ordering (NO, $\alpha=+1$) from inverted ordering (IO, $\alpha=-1$). With respect to our previous 2021 update, the combination of oscillation data leads to appreciably reduced uncertainties for $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$ and $|\Delta m^2|$. In particular, $|\Delta m^2|$ is the first $3\nu$ parameter to enter the domain of subpercent precision (0.8\% at $1\sigma$). We underline some issues about systematics, that might affect this error estimate. Concerning oscillation unknowns, we find a relatively weak preference for NO versus IO (at $2.2\sigma$), for CP violation versus conservation in NO (1.3$\sigma$) and for the first $\theta_{23}$ octant versus the second in NO ($1.1\sigma$). We discuss the status and qualitative prospects of the mass ordering hint in the plane $(\delta m^2,\,\Delta m^2_{ee})$, where $\Delta m^2_{ee}=|\Delta m^2|+{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\alpha(\cos^2\theta_{12}-\sin^2\theta_{12})\delta m^2$, to be measured by the JUNO experiment with subpercent precision. We also discuss upper bounds on nonoscillation observables. We report $m_\beta&lt;0.50$~eV and $m_{\beta\beta}&lt;0.086$~eV ($2\sigma$). Concerning the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma$, we discuss representative combinations of data, with or without augmenting the $\Lambda$CDM model with extra parameters accounting for possible systematics or new physics. The resulting $2\sigma$ upper limits are roughly spread around the bound $\Sigma &lt; 0.2$~eV within a factor of three. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>The Pierre Auger Observatory and Physics Beyond the Standard Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest cosmic ray detector, plays a pivotal role in exploring the frontiers of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. By the observation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, Auger provides critical insights into two major scenarios: super heavy dark matter and Lorentz invariance violation. Super heavy dark matter, hypothesized to originate in the early universe, offers a compelling explanation for the dark matter problem and is constrained by Auger through searches for photons and neutrinos resulting from its decay. Lorentz invariance violations, motivated by quantum gravity theories implying deviations from fundamental symmetries, are probed by Auger through alterations of the particle dispersion relation and the energy thresholds of their interactions with astrophysical photons backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Gain characterization of LGAD sensors with beta particles and 28-MeV protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.</description>

      <title>Discriminative versus Generative Approaches to Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the fundamental, emergent, and phenomenological parameters of particle and nuclear physics are determined through parametric template fits. Simulations are used to populate histograms which are then matched to data. This approach is inherently lossy, since histograms are binned and low-dimensional. Deep learning has enabled unbinned and high-dimensional parameter estimation through neural likelihiood(-ratio) estimation. We compare two approaches for neural simulation-based inference (NSBI): one based on discriminative learning (classification) and one based on generative modeling. These two approaches are directly evaluated on the same datasets, with a similar level of hyperparameter optimization in both cases. In addition to a Gaussian dataset, we study NSBI using a Higgs boson dataset from the FAIR Universe Challenge. We find that both the direct likelihood and likelihood ratio estimation are able to effectively extract parameters with reasonable uncertainties. For the numerical examples and within the set of hyperparameters studied, we found that the likelihood ratio method is more accurate and/or precise. Both methods have a significant spread from the network training and would require ensembling or other mitigation strategies in practice.</description>

      <title>Charged-hadron and identified-hadron ($K^\mathrm{0}_\mathrm{S}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^\mathrm{-}$) yield measurements in photo-nuclear Pb+Pb and $p$+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the measurement of charged-hadron and identified-hadron ($K^\mathrm{0}_\mathrm{S}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^\mathrm{-}$) yields in photo-nuclear collisions using 1.7 $\mathrm{nb^{-1}}$ of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV Pb+Pb data collected in 2018 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Candidate photo-nuclear events are selected using a combination of tracking and calorimeter information, including the zero-degree calorimeter. The yields as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity are measured in these photo-nuclear collisions as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. These photo-nuclear results are compared with 0.1 $\mathrm{nb^{-1}}$ of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV $p$+Pb data collected in 2016 by ATLAS using similar charged-particle multiplicity selections. These photo-nuclear measurements shed light on potential quark-gluon plasma formation in photo-nuclear collisions via observables sensitive to radial flow, enhanced baryon-to-meson ratios, and strangeness enhancement. The results are also compared with the Monte Carlo DPMJET-III generator and hydrodynamic calculations to test whether such photo-nuclear collisions may produce small droplets of quark-gluon plasma that flow collectively.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $P_{\psi}^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ within the Bethe-Salpeter framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining the effective Lagrangian and Bethe-Salpeter framework, we studied the mass spectra, wave functions, and strong decay widths of the two pentaquark states $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ reported by LHCb in 2019. We calculate the one-boson-exchange interaction kernel of $\bar D^*\Sigma_c$ in the isospin-$\frac12$ configuration. Then we present the Bethe-Salpeter equation(BSE) and wave functions for the bound states of a vector meson and a $\frac12$ baryon with $J^P={\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$. By solving the BSE we obtain 2 bound states for both ${\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$ spin-parity configuration, and the mass results favor the $(\frac32)^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ configuration for the $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$. Combining the effective Lagrangians and the obtained BS wave functions, we further calculate the strong decay channels $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$, $J/\psi(\eta_c) p$, and $\bar D\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ for the two $P_\psi^N$ states. In the favored $\frac32^-$ and $\frac12^-$ configuration, the obtained total widths are 34.8 MeV and $2.2$ MeV for $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$, respectively, which are substantially consistent with the LHCb data. The obtained decay widths suggest that $\bar D^{*0}\Lambda_c^+$ and $\bar D\Sigma_c$ are the dominant decay channels to detect $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$. Taking into account both the mass spectra and decay widths, our results favor the interpretation of $P_\psi^N(4440)$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)$ as the isospin-$\frac12$ $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ molecular states with $J^P$ configuration $(\frac{3}{2})^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Flow and thermal modelling of the argon volume in the DarkSide-20k TPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DarkSide-20k dark matter experiment, currently under construction at LNGS, features a dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC) with a ~50 t argon target from an underground well. At this scale, it is crucial to optimise the argon flow pattern for efficient target purification and for fast distribution of internal gaseous calibration sources with lifetimes of the order of hours. To this end, we have performed computational fluid dynamics simulations and heat transfer calculations. The residence time distribution shows that the detector is well-mixed on time-scales of the turnover time (~40 d). Notably, simulations show that despite a two-order-of-magnitude difference between the turnover time and the half-life of $^{83\text{m}}$Kr of 1.83 h, source atoms have the highest probability to reach the centre of the TPC 13 min after their injection, allowing for a homogeneous distribution before undergoing radioactive decay. We further analyse the thermal aspects of dual-phase operation and define the requirements for the formation of a stable gas pocket on top of the liquid. We find a best-estimate value for the heat transfer rate at the liquid-gas interface of 62 W with an upper limit of 144 W and a minimum gas pocket inlet temperature of 89 K to avoid condensation on the acrylic anode. This study also informs the placement of liquid inlets and outlets in the TPC. The presented techniques are widely applicable to other large-scale, noble-liquid detectors.</description>

      <title>Contribution of the light-collection non-uniformity to the energy resolution for the spaghetti-type calorimeter modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spaghetti-type calorimeters (SpaCal) are being considered as a potential solution for experiments at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC).
  SpaCal modules consist of an absorber block with a matrix of holes filled with scintillating fibres. This geometry offers a flexible granularity. However, the total number of scintillating fibres per channel could exceed the available photocathode surface area, necessitating a light guide to efficiently collect and register the scintillating light from the scintillating fibres to a photomultiplier. The non-uniformities in the light collection would impact the energy resolution of the detector.
  In this study, the impact of the light collection non-uniformity on the energy resolution is estimated for the various geometries of light guides using optical simulations~(GEANT4 simulation with optical photons). The study performed assumed a SpaCal prototype with $30\times 30$~mm$^2$ cell size and photomultipliers featuring realistic entrance window shapes and sizes, and explores different light guide designs.</description>

      <title>Data taking strategy for $\psi(3770)$ and $\Upsilon(4S)$ branching fraction measurements at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\psi(3770)$ and $\Upsilon(4S)$ states predominantly decay into open-flavor meson pairs, whereas the decays of $\psi(3770) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}D\bar{D}$ and $\Upsilon(4S) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}B\bar{B}$ are rare but crucial for elucidating the inner structure and decay dynamics of heavy quarkonium states. To achieve precise branching fraction measurements for $\psi(3770) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}D\bar{D}$ and $\Upsilon(4S) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}B\bar{B}$ decays at the high luminosity $e^+e^-$ annihilation experiments, we employed Monte Carlo simulations and Fisher information to evaluate various data taking scenarios, ultimately determining the optimal scheme. The consistent results of both methodologies indicate that the optimal energy points for studies of $\psi(3770) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}D\bar{D}$ decays are $3.769~\gev$ and $3.781~\gev$, whereas those for $\Upsilon(4S) \to \mbox{\text{non}-}B\bar{B}$ decays are $10.574~\gev$ and $10.585~\gev$. In addition, we studied the dependence of the precision in branching fraction measurements on the integrated luminosity, with the branching fractions spanning several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Low Tc Hafnium Kinetic Inductance Device with High Internal Quality Factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic inductance devices (KIDs) are superconducting resonators with high kinetic inductance sensitive to external energy perturbations. KIDs made with superconductors having $T_c$ far below one Kelvin are of particular interest for sensing minuscule signals, such as light dark matter detection and millimeter wave telescopes for astronomy and cosmology. In this work, we report the promising performance of KIDs fabricated with Hafnium from heated sputter depositions. The KIDs have $T_c$ lower than 249$\pm$2 mK, the internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of the resonators exceeds $10^5$ and the temperature dependence of the resonances can be described by the generalized Mattis-Bardeen model with a disorder parameter $\Gamma=4\times10^{-3}\Delta_0$. Post-fabrication annealing at temperatures above the deposition temperature can further reduce the $T_c$ and $\Gamma$ without reducing $Q_i$, leading to improvements in energy resolution.</description>

      <title>Comments on Compton forward scattering singularity in the NCQED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of head-to-head high energy Compton scattering in the $\theta$-exact noncommutative (NC) quantum electrodynamics (QED) on the Moyal space (NCQED) in the amid its unresolved forward scattering singularity. We model the effect of the currently unknown resolution to this unavoidable collinear singularity by cut-offs which are functions of the control variable $s/\Lambda_{\rm NC}^2$, and find that such cut-off functions can suppress NC corrections to the inverse Compton scattering to negligible. Discussed cut-offs leave the unpolarised integral cross section of the forward region larger than the backward region all the time, making the former potentially easier to observe. Our estimations indicate that such an effect may be visible in the future collider experiments when the NC scale $\Lambda_{\rm NC}\gtrsim1$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Production of the heavy-flavour decay lepton in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical study on the production of the heavy-flavour decay lepton (HFL) in high-energy nuclear collisions at the LHC. The pp-baseline is calculated by the FONLL program, which matches the next-to-leading order pQCD calculation with the next-to-leading-log large-$p_T$ resummation. The in-medium propagation of heavy quarks is driven by the modified Langevin equations, which consider both the elastic and inelastic partonic interactions. We propose a method to separate the respective influence of the six factors, such as pp-spectra, the cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, in-medium energy loss (E-loss), fragmentation functions (FFs), coalescence (Coal), and decay channels, which may contribute to the larger $R_{AA}$ of HFL $\leftarrow b$ compared to that of HFL $\leftarrow c$ in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Based on quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that both coalescence hadronization, decay channels and the mass-dependent E-loss play an essential role at $p_T&lt;5$ GeV, while the latter dominates the higher $p_T$ region. It is also found that the influences of the CNM effects and FFs are insignificant. At the same time, different initial pp-spectra of charm and bottom quarks have a considerable impact at $p_T&gt;5$ GeV. Furthermore, we explore the path-length dependence of jet quenching by comparing the HFL $R_{AA}$ in two different collision systems. Our investigations show smaller HFL $R_{AA}$ in Pb+Pb than in Xe+Xe within the same centrality bin, consistent with the ALICE data. The longer propagation time and more effective energy loss of heavy quarks in Pb+Pb collisions play critical roles in the stronger yield suppression of the HFL compared to that in Xe+Xe. In addition, we observe a scaling behavior of the HFL $R_{AA}$ in Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Classification of Coupled-Channel Near-Threshold Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since 2003, plenty of resonant structures have been observed in the heavy quarkonium regime. Many of them are close to the thresholds of a few pairs of heavy hadrons. They are candidates of exotic hadrons and have attracted immense attentions. Based on a coupled-channel nonrelativistic effective field theory, we classify the near-threshold structures of a symmetry-related two-channel system by studying the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes and pole positions with the variation of the single-channel scattering length and channel coupling strength. We show that the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes can be understood from the pole trajectories in the complex energy plane, and the pole evolution can be traced back to the renormalization group fixed points. We provide a dictionary of correspondence between the evolution of line shapes and pole trajectories along with varying interaction and channel coupling strengths, which can be used to understand the experimental observations of the near-threshold structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE) is proposed to search for charged lepton flavor violation and increase the sensitivity by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the MACS experiment at PSI in 1999. A clear signature of this conversion is the positron produced from antimuonium decay. This paper presents a near-$4\pi$-coverage calorimeter designed for MACE, which can provide an energy resolution of 10.8% at 511 keV, and a signal efficiency of 78.3% for annihilation $\gamma$-ray events. Detailed Monte-Carlo simulations using MACE offline software based on Geant4 are performed for geometry optimization, coincidence system design, background estimation, and benchmark detector validation.</description>

      <title>Muon collider probes of Majorana neutrino dipole moments and masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana neutrinos may have transitional dipole moments, which violate lepton number as well as lepton flavour. We estimate the sensitivity of future colliders to the electron-muon neutrino dipole moment, $\lambda_{e\mu}$, by considering same-sign dilepton final states. We find that hadron colliders, even the proposed FCC-hh, are sensitive only to $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\gtrsim 10^{-9}\mu_B$ (with $\mu_B$ the Bohr magneton), a value two-three orders of magnitude larger than current bounds from astrophysics and low-energy neutrino-scattering experiments. In the case of a future muon collider, we show that the sensitivity varies from $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\sim 5\cdot 10^{-9}\mu_B$ for energy $\sqrt{s}\simeq 3$ TeV, to $\sim 10^{-12}\mu_B$ for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 50$ TeV, matching the current laboratory bounds for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 30$ TeV. The singular advantage of the muon collider signal would be a direct, clean identification of lepton number and flavour violation. We also show that a muon collider would improve by orders of magnitude the direct bounds on $m_{e\mu}$ and $m_{\mu\mu}$, two of the entries of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix. These bounds could be as strong as $\sim 50$ keV, still far above the neutrino mass scale.</description>

      <title>Track reconstruction as a service for collider physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing charged-particle track reconstruction algorithms is crucial for efficient event reconstruction in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments due to their significant computational demands. Existing track reconstruction algorithms have been adapted to run on massively parallel coprocessors, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), to reduce processing time. Nevertheless, challenges remain in fully harnessing the computational capacity of coprocessors in a scalable and non-disruptive manner. This paper proposes an inference-as-a-service approach for particle tracking in high energy physics experiments. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, two distinct tracking algorithms are tested: Patatrack, a rule-based algorithm, and Exa$.$TrkX, a machine learning-based algorithm. The as-a-service implementations show enhanced GPU utilization and can process requests from multiple CPU cores concurrently without increasing per-request latency. The impact of data transfer is minimal and insignificant compared to running on local coprocessors. This approach greatly improves the computational efficiency of charged particle tracking, providing a solution to the computing challenges anticipated in the High-Luminosity LHC era.</description>

Abstract: According to recent lore, it is difficult to explain the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background obtained by pulsar timing arrays with supercooled first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). We demonstrate that supercooled FOPTs in dark U(1)' models with a conformal dark sector easily explain the nHz signal at NANOGrav.</description>

      <title>Beam test result and digitization of TaichuPix-3: A Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors for CEPC vertex detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), as the next-generation electron-positron collider, is tasked with advancing not only Higgs physics but also the discovery of new physics. Achieving these goals requires high-precision measurements of particles. Taichu seires, Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS), a key component of the vertex detector for CEPC was designed to meet the CEPC's requirements. For the geometry of vertex detector is long barrel with no endcap, and current silicon lacks a complete digitization model, precise estimation of cluster size particularly causing by particle with large incident angle is needed. Testbeam results were conducted at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) to evaluate cluster size dependence on different incident angles and threshold settings. Experimental results confirmed that cluster size increases with incident angle. Simulations using the Allpix$^2$ framework replicated experimental trends at small angles but exhibited discrepancies at large angles, suggesting limitations in linear electric field assumptions and sensor thickness approximations. The results from both testbeam and simulations have provided insights into the performance of the TaichuPix chip at large incident angles, offering a crucial foundation for the establishment of a digital model and addressing the estimation of cluster size in the forward region of the long barrel. Furthermore, it offers valuable references for future iterations of TaichuPix, the development of digital models, and the simulation and estimation of the vertex detector's performance.</description>
