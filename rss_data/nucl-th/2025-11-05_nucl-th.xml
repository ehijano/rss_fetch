      <title>General relativistic study of $f$-mode oscillations in neutron stars with gravitationally bound dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive investigation of nonradial oscillations in neutron star (NS) admixed with gravitationally bounded dark matter (DM) is carried out within the framework of full general relativity. The relativistic mean field (RMF) formalism is employed to illustrate the hadronic equation of state (EOS), while a physically motivated, gravitationally captured, non-uniform fermionic Higgs-portal DM component is incorporated to model DM-admixed NS. The DM distribution is characterized by two free parameters: $\alpha M_\chi$, an effective scaling factor that combines the DM concentration and the DM candidate mass, and $\beta$, a steepness index controlling the DM density distribution. The quasi normal mode (QNM) characteristics such as fundamental ($f$) mode frequency and its corresponding gravitational-wave (GW) damping time ($\tau$) is calculated for DM-admixed NS by solving the general relativistic perturbed equations involving axial as well as polar modes. The study demonstrates how the inclusion of DM distribution modifies the $f$-mode frequency and enhances the damping rate, reflecting a stronger coupling between matter and spacetime perturbations. Considering DM effects, the correlation analysis among DM model parameters, NS observables and QNM characteristics also carried out. Analytic fits for the $f-C-\tau$ and $f-\Lambda -\tau$ relations are constructed and calibrated for DM-admixed NS models. Building upon asteroseismic universal relations (URs), multimessenger constraint from the GW170817 event is employed by mapping the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}$ into the $(f_{1.4},\tau_{1.4})$ space, thereby providing observational bounds on the oscillation properties of canonical DM-admixed NS model.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the three-kaon interaction and its relation with $K(1460)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the hypothesis of $K(1460)$ being a hadronic $J^P=0^-$ molecule through nonperturbative $S$-wave $K K\bar K$, $K\pi\pi$, $K\pi\eta$ coupled-channel dynamics in a three-body unitary isobar approach. The scalar two-body coupled-channel resonances $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$, $a_0(980)$ and $K^*_0(700)$ are generated in the subsytems in amplitudes that match phase shifts from experiment. In a first step, previous results in the limit of mass-degenerate, stable $f_0$ and $a_0$ isobars are reproduced. Once the full seven-coupled channel model is switched on, other $S$-matrix effects obscure and modify the resonance signal, including complex thresholds, a two-body cusp, and a triangle singularity at threshold.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations (three using the NJL model and the other using the MFTQCD model), and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality on all sets. One set of hybrid NJL equations of state was also constrained by adding the GW170817 detection. All sets can describe observational data and theoretical restrictions. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at lower densities compared to the NJL models. The MFTQCD model indicates that NSs with 1.4 solar mass have quark matter in their inner core. However, NJL models suggest that it is more probable that 1.4 solar mass NSs do not contain quark matter. Both the MFTQCD and NJL models agree that there is quark matter in 2 solar mass NSs. It is discussed that hybrid stars with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius of more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, with respect to the canonical NS.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories: chiral anomaly in the finite temperature massless Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry has emerged in recent years as a practical quantity to study phases of matter. We present the first study of entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories by considering the chiral anomaly of the analytically solvable massless Schwinger model at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Incoherent Particle Production in Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first complete treatment of incoherent photon-initiated production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions, focussing on the dilepton and diphoton final states. In the former case we compare to the ATLAS measurement of dielectron production and find that our predictions match the data very well. In the latter case we show that this contribution is too small to explain the observed broad in diphoton acoplanarity background to the purely coherent light-by-light scattering signal. We in addition consider a new `quark emission' topology, which while naively might be expected to dominate the incoherent diphoton production channel, is in fact found to be kinematically suppressed. Finally, we revisit QCD-initiated diphoton production and issue of theoretical uncertainties in this case. We find that this again cannot explain the observed size of the higher acoplanarity background. The production mechanism leading to this background to light-by-light production, and the reason for its observed enhancement in comparison to the dilepton case, therefore remains unclear.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-type Love number differentiating quark stars from neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quark star (QS) is a hypothetical and yet undiscovered stellar object, and its existence would mark a paradigm shift in research on nuclear and quark matter. Although compactness is a well-known signature for distinguishing between two branches of QSs and neutron stars (NSs), some QSs can overlap with NSs in the radius-mass plane. To manifest their evident differences, we investigate the tidal properties of QSs and NSs. We then find that the magnetic-type Love number is a robust indicator for differentiating between QSs and NSs, whereas the electric-type one is insufficient when QSs and NSs have similar masses and radii. Finally, we show that gravitational waves from binary star mergers can be sensitive to differences between QSs and NSs to the detectable level.</description>

      <title>Exploring parameter dependence of heavy-flavor dynamics in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations from high-multiplicity proton-lead ($p$-Pb) collisions indicate that small systems may exhibit collective behavior in both heavy and light hadrons. This work investigates the roles of initial- and final-state interactions in shaping the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of $D$ mesons measured in $p$-Pb collisions. Initial-state effects, including the Cronin and shadowing effects, are considered in the heavy-quark initial conditions, while final-state interactions are simulated through Langevin evolution combined with the coalescence model of hadronization. Different initial geometries attributed to fluctuations in the medium's energy density are parametrized and translated into the momentum anisotropies of both light and heavy quarks. The corresponding $R_{pPb}$ and $v_2$ of D mesons in 8.16 TeV $p$-Pb collisions are calculated under different assumptions for the final-state interactions. Assuming that the initial-state effects only modify the transverse momentum spectra without altering the azimuthal distribution of heavy quarks, the measured $R_{pPb}$ of D mesons can be qualitatively reproduced by the combined influence of initial- and final-state effects. However, the observed $v_2$ cannot be accounted for by final-state interactions alone. These results suggest that additional contributions to azimuthal anisotropies of heavy quarks originating from initial-state effects are required to explain the experimentally observed $v_2$.</description>

      <title>Photon radiation induced by rescattering in strong-interacting medium with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photon radiation induced by rescattering in a magnetized medium is investigated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the high-energy limit, the photon emission rate and the associated electromagnetic energy loss are derived using the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formalism at first order in opacity, for a quark jet propagating a quark-gluon plasma under a background magnetic field. Quantitative analysis shows a slight suppression of the overall photon radiation over a broad range of jet energies in this process. This reduction in photon yield consequently leads to a moderate decrease in the electromagnetic energy loss of the jet. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the electromagnetic properties of strongly interacting matter in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions and motivate experimental comparison of photon yields from quark-gluon plasma with similar properties but distinct magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>Investigating event-shape methods in the search for the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the measured anisotropy $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method fulfills the general premise of measuring the CME but is statistically hungry. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background-contributing sources, because of statistical fluctuations of intertwining variables used in the method, and is thus not practically useful or clean to measure the CME.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>
