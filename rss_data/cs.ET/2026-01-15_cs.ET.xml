      <title>Probabilistic Computers for MIMO Detection: From Sparsification to 2D Parallel Tempering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic computers built from p-bits offer a promising path for combinatorial optimization, but the dense connectivity required by real-world problems scales poorly in hardware. Here, we address this through graph sparsification with auxiliary copy variables and demonstrate a fully on-chip parallel tempering solver on an FPGA. Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning. These results establish an on-chip p-bit architecture and a scalable algorithmic framework for dense combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Q-CHOP: Quantum constrained Hamiltonian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems that arise in science and industry typically have constraints. Yet the presence of constraints makes them challenging to tackle using both classical and quantum optimization algorithms. We propose a new quantum algorithm for constrained optimization, which we call quantum constrained Hamiltonian optimization (Q-CHOP). Our algorithm leverages the observation that for many problems, while the best solution is difficult to find, the worst feasible (constraint-satisfying) solution is known. The basic idea of Q-CHOP is to enforce a Hamiltonian constraint at all times, thereby restricting evolution to the subspace of feasible states, and slowly ``rotate'' an objective Hamiltonian to trace an adiabatic path from the worst feasible state to the best feasible state. Q-CHOP thereby assigns qualitatively distinct roles to the constraint and objective functions of a constrained optimization problem. We additionally propose a version of Q-CHOP that can start in any feasible state. Finally, we benchmark Q-CHOP against the commonly-used adiabatic algorithm of quantum annealing with an objective function that penalizes constraint violation, and find that Q-CHOP consistently performs significantly better on a wide range of problems, including textbook graph problems, knapsack problems, combinatorial auctions, and a real-world financial use case of bond exchange-traded fund basket optimization.</description>

      <title>Solving Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems in the Wool Textile Industry with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern manufacturing companies have evolved from a single production facility to a multi-factory production environment that must manage both regionally dispersed production orders and their multi-site production steps. The availability of a range of machines in different locations capable of performing the same operation and shipping times between factories have transformed planning systems from the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) to the Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP). Consequently, the complexity of production planning has increased significantly. We employ Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve the DFJSP in our research. In addition to assigning production orders to production sites, production steps are also assigned to these sites. This requirement is based on a real use case of a wool textile manufacturing company. To investigate the applicability of this method to large problem instances, problems ranging from 50 variables up to 250 variables, the largest problem that could be embedded into a D-Wave quantum annealer Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), are formulated and solved. Special Attention is dedicated to determining the Lagrange parameters of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and the QPU configuration parameters, as these factors can significantly impact solution quality. The obtained solutions are compared to solutions obtained by Simulated Annealing (SA), both in terms of solution quality and calculation time. The results demonstrate that QA has the potential to solve large problem instances specific to the industry.</description>

      <title>AQ-PCDSys: An Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System for Autonomous Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Successful autonomous planetary exploration hinges on real-time, high-fidelity environmental perception. However, standard deep learning models usually demand far more memory and computation power than space-qualified, radiation-hardened onboard hardware can provide. This creates a fundamental design challenge of deploying sophisticated detection architectures without saturating the rigid power and memory envelopes of the computation hardware of planetary exploration platforms. We propose the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System to resolve this bottleneck. Our framework integrates a Quantized Neural Network, refined through Quantization Aware Training, with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion module. By forcing weights into low-precision integer arithmetic, we effectively strip away the floating-point overhead that typically bottlenecks onboard processors and system memory. This yields a leaner model footprint and significantly faster processing while the detection fidelity remains high. Such efficiency enables AMF module to merge high-bandwidth Optical Imagery streams with Digital Elevation Models using an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism to re-balance sensor priority under variable conditions like deep shadows or high albedo. Integrated Multi-Scale Detection Heads then resolve craters across a wide range of diameters, providing a computationally efficient and precise solution for real-time detection, localization of craters and hazard avoidance. This paper establishes the architectural design and theoretical justification of the system. While our methodology is grounded in principles of hybrid computer vision and planetary science, we present this as a blueprint for future empirical validation and hardware benchmarking on integer-arithmetic units. This system provides a capability vital for the next generation of autonomous landing, navigation, and deep space explorations.</description>
