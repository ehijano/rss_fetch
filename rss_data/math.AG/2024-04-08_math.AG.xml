      <title>Modular curves $X_1(n)$ as moduli spaces of point arrangements and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complex elliptic curve $E$ and a point $p$ of order $n$ on it, the images of the points $p_k=kp$ under the Weierstrass embedding of $E$ into $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$ are collinear if and only if the sum of indices is divisible by $n$. Thus, it provides a realization of a certain matroid. We study this matroid in detail and prove that its realization space is isomorphic (over $\mathbb{C}$) to the modular curve $X_1(n)$, provided $n\geq 10$, which also provides an integral model of $X_1(n)$. In the process, we find a connection to the classical Ceva and B\"or\"oczky examples of special point and line configurations. We also discuss the situation for smaller values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Continuum envelops on Fargues-Fontaine curves and elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the theory of Bridgeland stability conditions, which was originated from string theory, to study the derived category of coherent sheaves on Fargues--Fontaine curves. This leads us to consider the quasi-coherent sheaves $\mathcal{O}(\theta^{\pm})$ via the convergents of an irrational number $\theta$.
  We define the continuum envelop $\mathrm{QCoh}_{\mathbb{R}}(X_{FF})$ to be the smallest abelian subcategory in $\mathrm{QCoh}(X_{FF})$ containing $\mathrm{Coh}(X_{FF})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\theta^{\pm})$. We study the homological algebra of $\mathrm{QCoh}_{\mathbb{R}}(X_{FF})$ via Farey diagrams. We show that the homological property of $\mathcal{O}(\theta^{\pm})$ depends heavily on the arithmetic property of $\theta$. The Fargues--Fontaine curves present strong similarity with complex elliptic curves in this point of view.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariant theory for graded additive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider geometric invariant theory for \emph{graded additive groups}, groups of the form $\mathbb{G}_a^r\rtimes_w\mathbb{G}_m$ such that the $\mathbb{G}_m$-action on $\mathbb{G}_a^r$ is a scalar multiplication with weight $w\in\mathbb{N}_+$. We provide an algorithm of equivariant birational modifications, such that we can apply the geometric invariant theory of B\'erczi-Doran-Hawes-Kirwan. In particular, the geometric $\mathbb{G}_a^r$-quotient exists. This complements B\'erczi-Doran-Hawes-Kirwan, in the special case of one grading weight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Kodaira vanishing holds for an arbitrary smooth Fano threefold in positive characteristic. To this end, we show that it is quasi-F-split when the Picard number or the Fano index is larger than one. We also establish Akizuki-Nakano vanishing for smooth Fano threefolds when the Picard number or the Fano index is larger than one, and therefore they lift to the ring of Witt vectors.</description>

      <title>The intersection cohomology Hodge module of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hodge filtration of the intersection cohomology Hodge module for toric varieties. More precisely, we study the cohomology sheaves of the graded de Rham complex of the intersection cohomology Hodge module and give a precise formula relating it with the stalks of the intersection cohomology as a constructible complex. The main idea is to use the Ishida complex in order to compute the higher direct images of the sheaf of reflexive differentials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. Let $X$ be a normal projective surface over $k$ with canonical singularities whose anti-canonical divisor is nef and big. We prove that $X$ is globally $F$-regular except for the following cases: (1) $K_X^2=4$ and $p=2$, (2) $K_X^2=3$ and $p \in \{2, 3\}$, (3) $K_X^2=2$ and $p \in \{2, 3\}$, (4) $K_X^2=1$ and $p \in \{2, 3, 5\}$. For each degree $K_X^2$, the assumption of $p$ is optimal.</description>

      <title>Non-archimedean SYZ fibrations via tropical contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a toric degeneration of Calabi--Yau complete intersections of Batyrev--Borisov in the Gross--Siebert program. The author showed in his previous work that there exists an integral affine contraction map called a tropical contraction, from the tropical variety obtained as its tropicalization to the dual intersection complex of the toric degeneration. In this article, we prove that the dual intersection complex is isomorphic to the essential skeleton of the Berkovich analytification as piecewise integral affine manifolds, and the composition of the tropicalization map and the tropical contraction is an affinoid torus fibration with a discriminant of codimension $2$, which induces the same integral affine structure as the one coming from the toric degeneration. This is a generalization of the earlier work by Pille-Schneider for a specific degeneration of Calabi--Yau hypersurfaces in projective spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We prove these theories are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis slice they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of the zero locus of ordered polynomials from completeness and we prove the failure of qantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas as well.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation of Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

      <title>On the Gonality type invariants and the slope of a fibered $3$-fold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{slope} of a fibered $3$-folds $f:X \to B$ is a relative numerical invariant defined by $\lambda(f) := K_{f}^{3}/\mathrm{deg}(f_{\ast}\omega_{f})$, where $K_{f}$ is the relative canonical divisor and $\omega_{f}$ is the relative dualizing sheaf. Establishing slope inequalities is a fundamental problem in the geography of fibered spaces. In this paper, we introduce a new invariant called the \textit{minimal covering degree} as a gonality-type invariant and study a lower bound of the slope increasing with the covering gonality and the minimal covering degree of the general fiber of $f$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the infinite Frobenius actions on the de Rham fundamental groups of affine curves defined over $\mathbf R$. As an application, we compute extension classes of real mixed Hodge structures associated with the motivic fundamental groups of affine curves. We establish connections between our computation and special values of Rankin-Selberg L-functions, focusing on the case of modular curves, and show that the associated extensions of mixed Hodge structures does not split. We compute local zeta integrals not only at good primes but also at certain bad primes.</description>

Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $\mathbb C$ of genus $g\geqslant 1$. Let $E$ be a vector bundle on $C$ of rank $r$ and degree $e$. Given integers $k_1,k_2,d_1,d_2$ such that $r&gt;k_1&gt;k_2&gt;0$, let $\mathcal Q^{k_1,k_2}_{d_1,d_2}(E)$ denote the nested Quot scheme which parametrizes pair of quotients $[E \twoheadrightarrow F_1 \twoheadrightarrow F_2]$ such that $F_i$ has rank $k_i$ and degree $d_i$. We show that these nested Quot schemes are integral, local complete intersection schemes when $d_1\gg d_2\gg 0$ or $d_2\gg d_1\gg 0$.</description>

      <title>Perspective and open problems on birational properties and singularities of moduli scheme of sheaves on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For complex projective smooth surface $X$, let $M$ be the coarse moduli scheme of rank-two stable sheaves with fixed Chern classes. Grasping the birational structure of $M$, for example its Kodaira dimension, is a fundamental problem. However, in the case where $\kappa(X)&gt;0$, the study of this problem has not necessarily been active in recent years. In this article we survey the study of this problem, especially for the case where $\kappa(X)=1$ and $c_1=0$. We will also survey some research on the structure of singularities of $M$, and a minimal model program of $M$. While explaining motivations, we raise several unsolved problems.</description>

      <title>An Ogus Principle for Zip period maps: The Hasse invariant's vanishing order via `Frobenius and the Hodge filtration'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper generalizes a result of Ogus that, under certain technical conditions, the vanishing order of the Hasse invariant of a family $Y/X$ of $n$-dimensional Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $p$ at a point $x$ of $X$ equals the "conjugate line position" of $H^n_{\text{dR}}(Y/X)$ at $x$, i.e. the largest $i$ such that the line of the conjugate filtration is contained in $\text{Fil}^i$ of the Hodge filtration. For every triple $(G,\mu,r)$ consisting of a connected, reductive $\mathbf{F}_p$-group $G$, a cocharacter $\mu \in X_*(G)$ and an $\mathbf{F}_p$-representation $r$ of $G$, we state a generalized Ogus Principle. If $\zeta:X \to \text{$G$-$\mathtt{Zip}$}^{\mu}$ is a smooth morphism (=`Zip period map'), then the group theoretic Ogus Principle implies an Ogus Principle on $X$. We deduce an Ogus Principle for several Hodge and abelian-type Shimura varieties and the moduli space of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Hodge-Chern classes and strata-effectivity in tautological rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected, reductive $\mathbf{F}_p$-group $G$, a cocharacter $\mu \in X_*(G)$ and a smooth zip period map $\zeta:X \to \mathop{\text{$G$-{\tt Zip}}}\nolimits^{\mu}$, we study which classes in the Wedhorn-Ziegler tautological rings $T^*(X), T^*(Y)$ of $X$ and its flag space $Y \to G-ZipFlag^{\mu}$ are \textit{strata-effective}, meaning that they are non-negative rational linear combinations of pullbacks of classes of zip (flag) strata closures. Two special cases are: (1) When $X=G\text{-Zip}^{\mu}$ and the tautological rings $\T^*(X)=\text{CH}_{\mathbf{Q}}(G-Zip^{\mu})$, $T^*(Y)=\text{CH}_{\mathbf{Q}}(G-ZipFlag^{\mu})$ are the entire Chow ring, and (2) When $X$ is the special fiber of an integral canonical model of a Hodge-type Shimura variety -- in this case the strata are also known as Ekedahl-Oort strata. We focus on the strata-effectivity of three types of classes: (a) Effective tautological classes, (b) Chern classes of Griffiths-Hodge bundles and (c) Generically $w$-ordinary curves. We connect the question of strata-effectivity in (a) to the global section `Cone Conjecture' of Goldring-Koskivirta. For every representation $r$ of $G$, we conjecture that the Chern classes of the Griffiths-Hodge bundle associated to $(G, \mu,r)$ are all strata-effective. This provides a vast generalization of a result of Ekedahl-van der Geer that the Chern classes of the Hodge vector bundle on the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties $\Acal_{g,\mathbf{F}_p}$ in characteristic $p$ are represented by the closures of $p$-rank strata. We prove several instances of our conjecture</description>

      <title>The moduli space of a rational map is Carath\'eodory hyperbolic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a rational map of degree $d\geq 2$. The moduli space $\mathcal{M}_f$, introduced by McMullen and Sullivan, is a complex analytic space consisting all quasiconformal conjugacy classes of $f$. For $f$ that is not flexible Latt\`es, we show that there is a normal affine variety $X_f$ of dimension $2d-2$ and a holomorphic injection $i:\mathcal{M}_f\to X_f$ such that $i(\mathcal{M}_f)$ is precompact in $X_f$. In particular $\mathcal{M}_f$ is Carath\'eodory hyperbolic (i.e. bounded holomorphic functions separate points in $\mathcal{M}_f$), provided that $f$ is not flexible Latt\`es. This solves a conjecture of McMullen. When $d\geq 4$, we give a concrete construction of $X_f$ as the normalization of the Zariski closure of the image of the reciprocal multiplier spectrum morphism.</description>

      <title>On the topology and combinatorics of decomposable arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complex hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ is said to be decomposable if there are no elements in the degree 3 part of its holonomy Lie algebra besides those coming from the rank 2 flats. When this purely combinatorial condition is satisfied, it is known that the associated graded Lie algebra of the arrangement group $G$ decomposes (in degrees greater than 1) as a direct product of free Lie algebras. It follows that the $I$-adic completion of the Alexander invariant $B(G)$ also decomposes as a direct sum of "local" invariants and the Chen ranks of $G$ are the sums of the local contributions. Moreover, if $B(G)$ is separated, then the degree 1 cohomology jump loci of the complement of $\mathcal{A}$ have only local components, and the algebraic monodromy of the Milnor fibration is trivial in degree 1.</description>

      <title>Boundary local integrability of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by studying boundary singularities of rational functions in two variables that are analytic on a domain, we investigate local integrability on $\mathbb{R}^2$ near $(0,0)$ of rational functions with denominator non-vanishing in the bi-upper half-plane but with an isolated zero (with respect to $\mathbb{R}^2$) at the origin. Building on work of Bickel-Pascoe-Sola, we give a necessary and sufficient test for membership in a local $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space and we give a complete description of all numerators $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally in a given $L^{p}$ space. As applications, we prove that every bounded rational function on the bidisk has partial derivatives belonging to $L^1$ on the two-torus. In addition, we give a new proof of a conjecture, started in Bickel-Knese-Pascoe-Sola and completed by Koll\'ar, characterizing the ideal of $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally bounded. A larger takeaway from this work is that a local model for stable polynomials we employ is a flexible tool and may be of use for other local questions about stable polynomials.</description>

      <title>Dynkin abelianisations of flag varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cerulli Irelli and Lanini have shown that PBW degenerations of flag varieties in type A and C are actually Schubert varieties of higher rank. We introduce Dynkin cones to parameterise specific abelianisations of classical Lie algebras. Within this framework, we generalise their result to all degenerations of flag varieties defined by degree vectors originating from a Dynkin cone. This framework allows us to determine the extent to which a flag variety can be degenerate while still naturally being a Schubert variety of the same Lie type. Furthermore, we compute the defining relations for the corresponding degenerate simple modules in all classical types.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the construction of a moduli space of semistable pairs parametrizing isomorphism classes of morphisms from a fixed coherent sheaf to any sheaf with fixed Hilbert polynomial under a notion of stability to the case of projective Deligne-Mumford stacks. We study the deformation and obstruction theories of stable pairs, and then prove the existence of virtual fundamental classes for some cases of dimension two and three. This leads to a definition of Pandharipande-Thomas invariants on three-dimensional smooth projective Deligne-Mumford stacks.</description>

      <title>Relative vanishing theorems for $\mathbf{Q}$-schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.10397v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the relative Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing, Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing, and Koll\'ar injectivity theorems for proper morphisms of schemes of equal characteristic zero, solving conjectures of Boutot and Kawakita. Our proof uses the Grothendieck limit theorem for sheaf cohomology and Zariski-Riemann spaces. We also show these vanishing and injectivity theorems hold for locally Moishezon (resp. projective) morphisms of quasi-excellent algebraic spaces admitting dualizing complexes and semianalytic germs of complex analytic spaces (resp. quasi-excellent formal schemes admitting dualizing complexes, rigid analytic spaces, Berkovich spaces, and adic spaces locally of weakly finite type over a field), all in equal characteristic zero.
  We give many applications of our vanishing results. For example, we extend Boutot's theorem to all Noetherian $\mathbf{Q}$-algebras by showing that if $R \to R'$ is a cyclically pure map of $\mathbf{Q}$-algebras and $R'$ is pseudo-rational, then $R$ is pseudo-rational. This solves a conjecture of Boutot and affirmatively answers a question of Schoutens. The proof of this Boutot-type result uses a new characterization of pseudo-rationality and rational singularities using Zariski-Riemann spaces. This characterization is also used in the proofs of our vanishing and injectivity theorems and is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.10141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a toric degeneration of Calabi--Yau complete intersections of Batyrev--Borisov in the Gross--Siebert program. One can associate two types of tropical spaces with it. One is a tropical variety obtained by tropicalization. The other one is an integral affine manifold with singularities, which arises as the dual intersection complex of the toric degeneration. In this article, we show that the latter is contained in the former as a subset, and construct an integral affine contraction map from the former to the latter. We also show that the contraction preserves tropical cohomology groups, and sends the eigenwave to the radiance obstruction.</description>

Abstract: We study some abelian subcategories and torsion pairs in Abramovich Polishchuk's heart. And we construct stability conditions on a full triangulated subcategory $\mathcal{D}^{\leq 1}_S$ in $D(X\times S)$, for an arbitrary smooth projective variety S. We also define a notion of $l$-th level stability, which is a generalization of the slope stability and the Gieseker stability. We show that for any object E in Abramovich Polishchuk's heart, there is a unique filtration whose factors are $l$-th level semistable, and the phase vectors are decreasing in a lexicographic order.</description>

      <title>On K-moduli of quartic threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of smooth Fano 3-folds with Picard rank 1 and anticanonical volume 4 consists of quartic 3-folds and of double covers of the 3-dimensional quadric branched along an octic surface. They can all be parametrised as complete intersections of a quadric and a quartic in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(1,1,1,1,1,2)$, denoted by $X_{2,4} \subset \mathbb{P}(1^5,2)$; all such smooth complete intersections are K-stable. With the aim of investigating the compactification of the moduli space of quartic 3-folds given by K-stability, we exhibit three phenomena: (i) there exist K-polystable complete intersection $X_{2,2,4} \subset \mathbb{P}(1^5,2^2)$ Fano 3-folds which deform to quartic 3-folds and are neither quartic 3-folds nor double covers of quadric 3-folds - in other words, the closure of the locus parametrising complete intersections $X_{2,4}\subset \mathbb{P}(1^5,2)$ in the K-moduli contains elements that are not of this type; (ii) any quasi-smooth $X_{2,2,4} \subset \mathbb{P}(1^5,2^2)$ is K-polystable; (iii) the closure in the K-moduli space of the locus parametrising complete intersections $X_{2,2,4} \subset \mathbb{P}(1^5,2^2)$ which are not complete intersections $X_{2,4} \subset \mathbb{P}(1^5,2)$ contains only points which correspond to complete intersections $X_{2,2,4} \subset \mathbb{P}(1^5,2^2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nash and Tognoli show that smooth closed manifolds can be the zero sets of some real polynomial maps and non-singular. The canonical projections of spheres naturally embedded in the $1$-dimensional higher Euclidean spaces and some natural functions on projective spaces, Lie groups and their quotient spaces are important examples of real algebraic functions being also Morse. In general, it is difficult to construct such examples of maps and the structures of the manifolds. In addition the maps are hard to understand globally.
  We construct examples by answering to a problem from singularity theory and differential topology. It asks whether we can reconstruct nice smooth functions with prescribed preimages. We have previously given an answer with real algebraic functions. This previous result is one of our key ingredients.</description>

Abstract: We determine the Brauer group of the Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$, the moduli space of elliptic curves with a marked $2$-torsion subgroup over bases of arithmetic interest. Antieau and Meier determine the Brauer group for $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$, the moduli stack of elliptic curves by exploiting the fact it is covered by the Legendre family and using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Over an algebraically closed field, Shin uses the coarse space map to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$. We combine techniques from both papers to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$.</description>

We also study the $k$-du Bois definition from the perspective of holomorphic extension and compare how different restrictions on $\mathscr H^0(\underline \Omega_X^p)$ affect the singularities of $X$, where $\underline\Omega_X^p$ is the $p^{th}$-graded piece of the du Bois complex.</description>

      <title>On decompositions for Fano schemes of intersections of two quadrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose conjectural semiorthogonal decompositions for Fano schemes of linear subspaces on intersections of two quadrics, in terms of symmetric powers of the associated hyperelliptic (resp. stacky) curve. When the intersection is odd-dimensional, we moreover conjecture an identity in the Grothendieck ring of varieties and other motivic contexts. The evidence for these conjectures is given by upgrading recent results of Chen-Vilonen-Xue, to obtain formulae for the Hodge numbers of these Fano schemes. This allows us to numerically verify the conjecture in the hyperelliptic case, and establish a combinatorial identity as evidence for the stacky case.</description>

      <title>Coupled Cluster Degree of the Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the number of complex solutions to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem on the Grassmannian in its Pl\"ucker embedding. This is motivated by quantum chemistry, where it represents the truncation to single electrons in coupled cluster theory. We prove the formula for the Grassmannian of lines which was conjectured in earlier work with Fabian Faulstich. This rests on the geometry of the graph of a birational parametrization of the Grassmannian. We present a squarefree Gr\"obner basis for this graph, and we develop connections to toric degenerations from representation theory.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Model for Coordinated Multi-Satellite Joint Transmission System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite communication is one of the key technologies that is enabling next-generation networks. However, nearest-satellite-supported downlink transmission may not meet a user's requirements due to limited signal strength, especially in emergent scenarios. In this paper, we investigate a coordinated multi-satellite joint transmission system from a system-level perspective, where a user can be served by multiple satellites to improve its quality-of-service (QoS). Furthermore, we analyze the coverage and rate of a typical user in the joint transmission system. Simulation and numerical results show that the introduced system achieves a higher coverage probability than the traditional nearest-satellite-supported network. Moreover, a user's ergodic rate can be maximized by selecting an appropriate number of serving satellites.</description>

      <title>Finiteness Theorems and Counting Conjectures for the Flux Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the string theory landscape obtained from type IIB and F-theory flux compactifications. We first give a comprehensive introduction to a number of mathematical finiteness theorems, indicate how they have been obtained, and clarify their implications for the structure of the locus of flux vacua. Subsequently, in order to address finer details of the locus of flux vacua, we propose three mathematically precise conjectures on the expected number of connected components, geometric complexity, and dimensionality of the vacuum locus. With the recent breakthroughs on the tameness of Hodge theory, we believe that they are attainable to rigorous mathematical tools and can be successfully addressed in the near future. The remainder of the paper is concerned with more technical aspects of the finiteness theorems. In particular, we investigate their local implications and explain how infinite tails of disconnected vacua approaching the boundaries of the moduli space are forbidden. To make this precise, we present new results on asymptotic expansions of Hodge inner products near arbitrary boundaries of the complex structure moduli space.</description>

      <title>Monodromy of elliptic logarithms: some topological methods and effective results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present some effective approaches in studying the relative monodromy group of elliptic logarithms with respect to periods of elliptic schemes. We provide explicit ways of constructing explicit loops which leave periods unchanged but along which logarithms have non-trivial variations. We also get some topological methods and effective results which allow to manage the ramification locus of sections. The paper was inspired by a theorem of Corvaja and Zannier which abstractly determine the relative monodromy group of non-torsion sections.</description>
