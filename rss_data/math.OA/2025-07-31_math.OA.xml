      <title>Free semigroupoid algebras and the first cohomology groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates derivations of the free semigroupoid algebra $\mathfrak{L}_G$ of a countable or uncountable directed graph $G$ and its norm-closed version, the tensor algebra $\mathcal{A}_G$. We first prove a weak Dixmier approximation theorem for $\mathfrak{L}_G$ when $G$ is strongly connected. Using the theorem, we show that if every connected component of $G$ is strongly connected, then every bounded derivation $\delta$ from $\mathcal{A}_G$ into $\mathfrak{L}_G$ is of the form $\delta=\delta_T$ for some $T\in\mathfrak{L}_G$ with $\|T\|\leqslant\|\delta\|$. For any finite directed graph $G$, we also show that the first cohomology group $H^1(\mathcal{A}_G,\mathfrak{L}_G)$ vanishes if and only if every connected component of $G$ is either strongly connected or a fruit tree.
  To handle infinite directed graphs, we introduce the alternating number and propose \Cref{conj intro-in-tree}. Suppose every connected component of $G$ is not strongly connected. We show that if every bounded derivation from $\mathcal{A}_G$ into $\mathfrak{L}_G$ is inner, then every connected component of $G$ is a generalized fruit tree and the alternating number $A(G)$ of $G$ is finite. The converse is also true if the conjecture holds.
  Finally, we provide some examples of free semigroupoid algebras together with their nontrivial first cohomology groups.</description>

      <title>Sections and cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By Bartle-Graves theorem every surjective map between C*-algebras has a continuous section, and Loring proved that that there exists a continuous section of norm arbitrary close to 1. Here we prove that there exists a continuous section of norm exactly 1. This result is used in the second part of the paper which is devoted to properties of cone C*-algebras.
  It is proved that any $\ast$-homomorphism from the cone over a separable C*-algebra to a quotient C*-algebra always lifts to a contractive asymptotic homomorphism.
  As an application we give a short proof and strengthen the result of Forough-Gardella-Thomsen that states that any cpc (order zero) map has an asymptotically cpc (order zero, respectively) lift.
  As another application we give unified proofs of Voiculescu's result that cones are quasidiagonal and Brown-Carrion-White's result that all amenable traces on cones are quasidiagonal. We also prove that all hyperlinear traces on cones are MF.</description>

      <title>Real Noncommutative Convexity II: Extremality and nc convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue with the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convexity, following the recent and profound complex case developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the theory of nc extreme (and pure and maximal) points and the nc Choquet boundary in the real case, and on the theory of real nc convex and semicontinuous functions and real nc convex envelopes. Our main emphasis is on how these interact with complexification. For example some of our paper analyzes carefully how various notions of `extreme' or `maximal' interact with our earlier concept of the complexification of a convex set. Several new features appear in the real case in later sections of our paper, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex function, and the complexification of the convex envelope of a nc function. With an Appendix by T. Russell.</description>

      <title>Upgraded free independence phenomena for random unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study upgraded free independence phenomena for unitary elements $u_1$, $u_2$, \dots representing the large-$n$ limit of Haar random unitaries, showing that free independence extends to several larger algebras containing $u_j$ in the ultraproduct of matrices $\prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Using a uniform asymptotic freeness argument and volumetric analysis, we prove free independence of the Pinsker algebras $\mathcal{P}_j$ containing $u_j$. The Pinsker algebra $\mathcal{P}_j$ is the maximal subalgebra containing $u_j$ with vanishing $1$-bounded entropy defined by Hayes; $\mathcal{P}_j$ in particular contains the relative commutant $\{u_j\}' \cap \prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$, more generally any unitary that can be connected to $u_j$ by a sequence of commuting pairs of Haar unitaries, and any unitary $v$ such that $v\mathcal{P}_j v^* \cap \mathcal{P}_j$ is diffuse. Through an embedding argument, we go back and deduce analogous free independence results for $\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a free product of Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebras $\mathcal{M}_i$, which thus yields (in the Connes-embeddable case) a generalization and a new proof of Houdayer--Ioana's results on free independence of approximate commutants. It also yields a new proof of the general absorption results for Connes-embeddable free products obtained by the first author, Hayes, Nelson, and Sinclair.</description>

      <title>Isometric pairs with compact and normal cross-commutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We represent and classify pairs of commuting isometries $(V_1, V_2)$ acting on Hilbert spaces that satisfy the condition \[ [V_1^*, V_2] = \text{compact and normal}, \] where $[V_1^*, V_2] := V_1^* V_2 - V_2 V_1^*$ is the cross-commutator of $(V_1, V_2)$. The precise description of such pairs also gives a complete and concrete set of unitary invariants. The basic building blocks of representations of such pairs consist of four distinguished pairs of commuting isometries. One of them relies on some peculiar examples of invariant subspaces tracing back to Rudin's intricate constructions of analytic functions on the bidisc. Along the way, we present a rank formula for a general pair of commuting isometries that looks to be the first of its kind.</description>

      <title>Groupoid Characterization of Partial Algebras on Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $L^p$-spaces, with $p \not = \infty$, form a partial algebra $(L^p(\Omega), \Gamma, \cdot)$ with pointwise multiplication of functions. The Sobolev spaces $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$, delineated by weak derivatives as subspaces of $L^p$-spaces is shown to contain the partial algebra $(L^p(\Omega), \Gamma, \cdot)$ generalized by the partial action of the smooth algebra $\mathscr{K}(\Omega)$ by convolution on the Banach spaces $L^p(\Omega)$. We characterised the Sobolev space $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$, invariant under $\mathscr{K}(\Omega)$ partial action, using Lie groupoid framework, and study the partial algebra as defining the partial dynamical systems on the $L^p$-space associated with the weak differential operators. The locally convex partial $^*$-algebra $(L^p(\Omega), \Gamma, \cdot,^*)$ defines the stable local flows coinciding with local bisections of the Lie groupoid. The unitary representation of resulting Lie groupoid $\mathscr{W} \rightrightarrows W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ on the associated Hilbert bundle demonstrates the simplification achieved by the characterisation.</description>

      <title>General limit theorems for mixtures of free, monotone, and boolean independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mixtures of free, monotone, and Boolean independence described by a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ in the context of $\mathcal{T}$-free convolutions of Jekel and Liu. We prove general limit theorems for the associated additive convolution operations $\boxplus_G$. For a sequence of digraphs $G_n = (V_n,E_n)$, we give sufficient conditions for the limit $\widehat{\mu} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \boxplus_{G_n}(\mu_n)$ to exist whenever the Boolean convolution powers $\mu_n^{\uplus |V_n|}$ converge to some $\mu$. This in particular includes central limit and Poisson limit theorems, as well as limit theorems for each classical domain of attraction. The hypothesis on the sequence of $G_n$ is that the normalized counts of digraph homomorphisms from rooted trees into $G_n$ converge as $n \to \infty$, and we verify this for several families of examples where the $G_n$'s converge in some sense to a continuum limit, or digraphon. In particular, we obtain a new limit theorem for multiregular digraphs, as well as recovering several limit theorems in prior work.</description>

      <title>Non-geometric property (T) of warped cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometric property (T) for discretized warped cones of an action on a compact Lie group $M$ by its finitely generated subgroup. We show that if a subgroup $G$ is dense in $M$, then the associated discretized warped cone $\bigsqcup_n M\times \{t(n)\}$ does not have geometric property (T) for any sequence of positive numbers $\{t(n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converging to $\infty$. This result applies to certain ergodic actions of groups with property (T), for example, the action of $SO(d,\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{5}])$ on $SO(d)$ with $d\geq 5$.
  As an application, we obtain new examples of expanders without geometric property (T), including certain superexpanders.</description>

      <title>On Frustration-Free Quantum Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of our work is to characterize the landscape of the frustration-free quantum spin models over the Cayley graph of a finitely generated group $G$. This is achieved by establishing $G$-equivariant morphisms from the partially ordered space of frustration-free models to the partially ordered spaces 1) of hereditary $C^\ast$-algebras of the underlying UHF quasi-local algebra of observables, 2) of open projections in its double dual, and 3) of subsets of pure state space. Our main result consists of an intrinsic characterization of the images of these morphisms, which captures the essence of frustration-freeness and enables us to extend the concept to generic AF-algebras. Additionally, using well established facts about AF-algebras, we prove density theorems, provide intrinsic characterizations of frustration-free ground states, and propose a definition of a boundary algebra for models constrained to half-lattices, under the sole assumption of frustration-freeness.</description>

      <title>A partitioned manifold index theorem for noncompact hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roe's partitioned manifold index theorem applies when a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ is cut into two pieces along a compact hypersurface $N$. It states that a version of the index of a Dirac operator on $M$ localized to $N$ equals the index of the corresponding Dirac operator on $N$. This yields obstructions to positive scalar curvature, and implies cobordism invariance of the index of Dirac operators on compact manifolds. We generalize this result to cases where $N$ may be noncompact, under assumptions on the way it is embedded into $M$. This results in an equality between two classes in the $K$-theory of the Roe algebra of $N$. Bunke and Ludewig, and Engel and Wulff, have recently obtained related results based on different approaches.</description>
