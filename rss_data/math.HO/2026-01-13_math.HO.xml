      <title>A First Course in Sparse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of sparse optimization, with a focus on both sparse signal recovery and sparse regularization techniques. We will begin by exploring the foundations of sparse optimization, delving into the mathematical tools and models that underpin sparse signal recovery and LASSO. We will then discuss key algorithms for both sparse recovery (e.g., basis pursuit, matching pursuit) and sparse regularization (e.g., LASSO, elastic net), along with their applications in real-world problems. Throughout the text, we balance intuitive explanations with rigorous mathematical formulations to provide a comprehensive resource for both newcomers and experts in the field. Our aim is twofold: to provide a self-contained entry point for students and researchers new to the field, and to offer a rigorous reference for practitioners seeking to apply sparse optimization in science and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1960s, John Nash proposed a method to resolve singularities. Five decades of encouraging results could not prevent an unexpected ending: the method does not work in general. In this note (written in Spanish), we tell the story of the rise and fall of the Nash blowup.</description>

      <title>Blues for Alice: The Interplay of Neo-Riemannian and Cadential Viewpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a property of Mazzola's theory of cadential sets in relation to the modulation between minor and major tonalities from triadic to tetradic harmony, using the PLRQ group of Cannas et al. (2017) as the analogue of the classical PLR group. While the PLR group connects triadic cadential sets via the relative morphism $R$, the tetradic case reveals a richer structure: two pairs of cadential sets connected by distinct morphisms forming a "prism" in the slice category over the tonic seventh chord, and a single pair for those that allow quantized modulations. We demonstrate this structure through analysis of Charlie Parker's "Blues for Alice" (1951) and Ray Noble's "Cherokee" (1938), showing how the prism morphism, PLRQ transformations and quantized modulations organize harmonic navigation in bebop. The categorical framework captures what syntactic approaches miss: the transformational v\'{e}cu that musicians actually experience when navigating between cadential regions.</description>

      <title>Turk's head knots and links: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We collect and discuss various results on an important family of knots and links called Turk's head knots and links $Th (p,q)$. In the mathematical literature, they also appear under different names such as rosette knots and links or weaving knots and links. Unless being the unknot or the alternating torus links $T(2,q)$, the Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are all known to be alternating, fibered, hyperbolic, invertible, non-split, periodic, and prime. The Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are also both positive and negative amphichiral if $p$ is chosen to be odd. Moreover, we highlight and present several more results, focusing on Turk's head knots $Th (3,q)$. We finally list several open problems and conjectures for Turk's head knots and links. We conclude with a short appendix on torus knots and links, which might be of independent interest.</description>
