      <title>F$^3$low: Frame-to-Frame Coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics with SE(3) Guided Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a crucial technique for simulating biological systems, enabling the exploration of their dynamic nature and fostering an understanding of their functions and properties. To address exploration inefficiency, emerging enhanced sampling approaches like coarse-graining (CG) and generative models have been employed. In this work, we propose a \underline{Frame-to-Frame} generative model with guided \underline{Flow}-matching (F$3$low) for enhanced sampling, which (a) extends the domain of CG modeling to the SE(3) Riemannian manifold; (b) retreating CGMD simulations as autoregressively sampling guided by the former frame via flow-matching models; (c) targets the protein backbone, offering improved insights into secondary structure formation and intricate folding pathways. Compared to previous methods, F$3$low allows for broader exploration of conformational space. The ability to rapidly generate diverse conformations via force-free generative paradigm on SE(3) paves the way toward efficient enhanced sampling methods.</description>

      <title>HMAMP: Hypervolume-Driven Multi-Objective Antimicrobial Peptides Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have exhibited unprecedented potential as biomaterials in combating multidrug-resistant bacteria. Despite the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence for novel AMP design, challenges pertaining to conflicting attributes such as activity, hemolysis, and toxicity have significantly impeded the progress of researchers. This paper introduces a paradigm shift by considering multiple attributes in AMP design.
  Presented herein is a novel approach termed Hypervolume-driven Multi-objective Antimicrobial Peptide Design (HMAMP), which prioritizes the simultaneous optimization of multiple attributes of AMPs. By synergizing reinforcement learning and a gradient descent algorithm rooted in the hypervolume maximization concept, HMAMP effectively expands exploration space and mitigates the issue of pattern collapse. This method generates a wide array of prospective AMP candidates that strike a balance among diverse attributes. Furthermore, we pinpoint knee points along the Pareto front of these candidate AMPs. Empirical results across five benchmark models substantiate that HMAMP-designed AMPs exhibit competitive performance and heightened diversity. A detailed analysis of the helical structures and molecular dynamics simulations for ten potential candidate AMPs validates the superiority of HMAMP in the realm of multi-objective AMP design. The ability of HMAMP to systematically craft AMPs considering multiple attributes marks a pioneering milestone, establishing a universal computational framework for the multi-objective design of AMPs.</description>

      <title>A Simple Comparison of Biochemical Systems Theory and Metabolic Control Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores some basic concepts of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) and Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), two frameworks developed to understand the behavior of biochemical networks. Initially introduced by Savageau, BST focuses on system stability and employs power laws in modeling biochemical systems. On the other hand, MCA, pioneered by authors such as Kacser and Burns and Heinrich and Rapoport, emphasizes linearization of the governing equations and describes relationships (known as theorems) between different measures. Despite apparent differences, both frameworks are shown to be equivalent in many respects. Through a simple example of a linear chain, the paper demonstrates how BST and MCA yield identical results when analyzing steady-state behavior and logarithmic gains within biochemical pathways. This comparative analysis highlights the interchangeability of concepts such as kinetic orders, elasticities and other logarithmic gains.</description>

      <title>CACTUS: Chemistry Agent Connecting Tool-Usage to Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, but they often lack the ability to access and reason over domain-specific knowledge and tools. In this paper, we introduced CACTUS (Chemistry Agent Connecting Tool-Usage to Science), an LLM-based agent that integrates cheminformatics tools to enable advanced reasoning and problem-solving in chemistry and molecular discovery. We evaluate the performance of CACTUS using a diverse set of open-source LLMs, including Gemma-7b, Falcon-7b, MPT-7b, Llama2-7b, and Mistral-7b, on a benchmark of thousands of chemistry questions. Our results demonstrate that CACTUS significantly outperforms baseline LLMs, with the Gemma-7b and Mistral-7b models achieving the highest accuracy regardless of the prompting strategy used. Moreover, we explore the impact of domain-specific prompting and hardware configurations on model performance, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering and the potential for deploying smaller models on consumer-grade hardware without significant loss in accuracy. By combining the cognitive capabilities of open-source LLMs with domain-specific tools, CACTUS can assist researchers in tasks such as molecular property prediction, similarity searching, and drug-likeness assessment. Furthermore, CACTUS represents a significant milestone in the field of cheminformatics, offering an adaptable tool for researchers engaged in chemistry and molecular discovery. By integrating the strengths of open-source LLMs with domain-specific tools, CACTUS has the potential to accelerate scientific advancement and unlock new frontiers in the exploration of novel, effective, and safe therapeutic candidates, catalysts, and materials. Moreover, CACTUS's ability to integrate with automated experimentation platforms and make data-driven decisions in real time opens up new possibilities for autonomous discovery.</description>

      <title>Image segmentation of treated and untreated tumor spheroids by Fully Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are advanced cell culture systems for assessing the impact of combinatorial radio(chemo)therapy. They exhibit therapeutically relevant in-vivo-like characteristics from 3D cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to radial pathophysiological gradients related to proliferative activity and nutrient/oxygen supply, altering cellular radioresponse. State-of-the-art assays quantify long-term curative endpoints based on collected brightfield image time series from large treated spheroid populations per irradiation dose and treatment arm. Here, spheroid control probabilities are documented analogous to in-vivo tumor control probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier curves. This analyses require laborious spheroid segmentation of up to 100.000 images per treatment arm to extract relevant structural information from the images, e.g., diameter, area, volume and circularity. While several image analysis algorithms are available for spheroid segmentation, they all focus on compact MCTS with clearly distinguishable outer rim throughout growth. However, treated MCTS may partly be detached and destroyed and are usually obscured by dead cell debris. We successfully train two Fully Convolutional Networks, UNet and HRNet, and optimize their hyperparameters to develop an automatic segmentation for both untreated and treated MCTS. We systematically validate the automatic segmentation on larger, independent data sets of spheroids derived from two human head-and-neck cancer cell lines. We find an excellent overlap between manual and automatic segmentation for most images, quantified by Jaccard indices at around 90%. For images with smaller overlap of the segmentations, we demonstrate that this error is comparable to the variations across segmentations from different biological experts, suggesting that these images represent biologically unclear or ambiguous cases.</description>

      <title>CESPED: a new benchmark for supervised particle pose estimation in Cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06194v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryo-EM is a powerful tool for understanding macromolecular structures, yet current methods for structure reconstruction are slow and computationally demanding. To accelerate research on pose estimation, we present CESPED, a new dataset specifically designed for Supervised Pose Estimation in Cryo-EM. Alongside CESPED, we provide a PyTorch package to simplify Cryo-EM data handling and model evaluation. We evaluated the performance of a baseline model, Image2Sphere, on CESPED, which showed promising results but also highlighted the need for further improvements. Additionally, we illustrate the potential of deep learning-based pose estimators to generalise across different samples, suggesting a promising path toward more efficient processing strategies. CESPED is available at https://github.com/oxpig/cesped.</description>

      <title>RawHash2: Mapping Raw Nanopore Signals Using Hash-Based Seeding and Adaptive Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05771v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Summary: Raw nanopore signals can be analyzed while they are being generated, a process known as real-time analysis. Real-time analysis of raw signals is essential to utilize the unique features that nanopore sequencing provides, enabling the early stopping of the sequencing of a read or the entire sequencing run based on the analysis. The state-of-the-art mechanism, RawHash, offers the first hash-based efficient and accurate similarity identification between raw signals and a reference genome by quickly matching their hash values. In this work, we introduce RawHash2, which provides major improvements over RawHash, including a more sensitive quantization and chaining implementation, weighted mapping decisions, frequency filters to reduce ambiguous seed hits, minimizers for hash-based sketching, and support for the R10.4 flow cell version and various data formats such as POD5 and SLOW5. Compared to RawHash, RawHash2 provides better F1 accuracy (on average by 10.57% and up to 20.25%) and better throughput (on average by 4.0x and up to 9.9x) than RawHash. Availability and Implementation: RawHash2 is available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/RawHash. We also provide the scripts to fully reproduce our results on our GitHub page.</description>
