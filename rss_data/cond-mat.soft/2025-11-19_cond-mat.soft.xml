      <title>Tunable dynamics of flexible magnetic microcrosses: synchronous rotation, breathing and out-of-plane arm overtaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine colloidal self-assembly and soft-lithography techniques to realize flexible magnetic microcrosses that can be manipulated via external, time dependent magnetic fields. The crosses are characterized by a central domain connected via four flexible arms. When subjected to an in-plane, rotating magnetic field, the crosses transit from a synchronous to an asynchronous spinning motion where their average rotation decreases with the driving frequency. In the asynchronous regime and at low field amplitudes, the crosses display a breathing mode, characterized by relative oscillations between the arms, while remaining localized in the two dimensional plane. In contrast, for high field amplitudes, we observe an arm overtaking regime where two opposite filaments surpass the remaining ones forcing the cross to perform a three-dimensional gyroscopic-like rotation. Using slender body theory and balancing the effect of magnetic and elastic interactions, we recover the experimental findings and show that the overtaking regime occurs due to different arm magnetizations. Our engineered microscopic colloidal rotors characterized by multiple flexible filaments may find potential applications for precise lab-on-a-chip operations or as stirrers dispersed within microfluidic or biological channels.</description>

      <title>Dynamical behavior of compound vesicles in wall-bounded shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a numerical study addressing the dynamics of compound vesicles confined in a channel under shear flow. The system comprises a smaller vesicle embedded within a larger one and can be used to mimic, for example, leukocytes or nucleate cells. A two-dimensional model, which combines molecular dynamics and mesoscopic hydrodynamics including thermal fluctuations, is adopted to perform an extended investigation. We are able to vary independently the swelling degree and the relative size of vesicles, the viscosities of fluids internal and external to vesicles, and the Capillary number, so to observe a rich dynamical phenomenology which goes well beyond what observed for single vesicles, matching quantitatively with experimental findings. Tank-treading, tumbling, and trembling motions are enriched by dynamical states where inner and outer vesicles can perform different motions. We show that thermal fluctuations are crucial during trembling and swinging dynamics, as observed in experiments. Undulating motion of the external vesicle, characterized by periodic oscillation of the inclination and buckling of the membrane, is observed at high filling fractions. This latter state exhibits features that are shown to depend on the relative size, the swelling degree of both vesicles as well as on thermal noise lacking in previous analytical and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations reveal internal tension in native state collagen fibrils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collagen fibrils are the building block of many biological tissues, which viability depend on the fibrils properties. Altered properties of collagen fibrils are central to the appearance of many diseases, and physiological or native properties must be reproduced for tissue engineering. Yet, the self-assembly, the structure, and therefore the properties of collagen fibrils remain elusive. One main reason is the extreme sensitivity of the fibrils to their environmental conditions, and in particular hydration which is only loosely bound by experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanics are an integral part of the self-assembly process and may result in internal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions. Here, we propose to investigate internal stresses in collagen fibrils by means of molecular dynamics simulations of the collagen microfibril model. Our simulations reveal the quantitative evolution of internal stresses in collagen fibrils with hydration. We establish a value of native hydration of collagen fibrils at 0.78 g/g based on an absence of cross-sectional stresses. In turn, we determine a quantitative estimate of internal longitudinal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions of 210 MPa. We find that internal longitudinal stresses are caused by an over-extended protein backbone rather than partial hydration, which appears remnant of the local forces driving collagen self-assembly. We also demonstrate the consequences of internal longitudinal stresses on the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils, which the absence of induces more than a 20% decrease in the Young's modulus. Overall, our findings provide insights into the native structure and properties of collagen fibrils. More than ever, collagen fibrils appear to be assembled via an out-of-equilibrium process key for the synthesis of viable tissues.</description>

      <title>Inertial active particles in a Poiseuille flow: negative mobility and particle separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusive behavior of small entities is strongly influenced by the flow of the surrounding medium, which is ubiquitous in natural and artificial environments. In this study, we investigate the transport characteristics of the inertial active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a microfluidic channel under a Poiseuille flow. The interplay between the inertia of the particles and the imposed fluid flow leads to interesting diffusive behaviors. For instance, in the overdamped regime ($m \to 0$), particles exhibit a negative average velocity $\langle v \rangle$ due to upstream movement. As $m$ increases, particles tend to move along the flow direction with an increase in $\langle v \rangle$ in the positive direction, exhibiting a maximum at optimal $m$, and diminish for higher $m$ values. The effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff}$ also shows a peak at this optimal $m$. Interestingly, at higher $m$ values, $D_{eff}$ decreases with increasing the noise strength. The self-propelled velocity of the particles further enhances the upstream movement. Further, the rotation rate of the particles also contributes positively to the upstream motion, and enhances the diffusion of the particles by many orders in the limit of higher $m$. This study reveals that inertia not only modifies swimmer flow interactions but also enables new dynamical regimes, where mass-dependent trajectories can be harnessed for selective control. Such control holds promise for mass based particle separation in precisely engineered environments and lab on a chip devices for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Analytic theory of shear localization in amorphous solids confined by Couette geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Couette geometry'' refers to two concentric rings in 2-dimensions (or cylinders in 3-dimensions with a medium in between. Typically the inner and outer rings (or cylinders) rotate at different rates and the response of the medium is studied. Here we study a medium which is a twodimensional amorphous solid, and we rotate the inner ring quasi-statically. As stress accumulates, plastic avalanches can result in shear localization, characterized by adjacent parts of the system rotating in opposite directions, with the maximum shear localized between them. We derive an analytic theory that describes and explains the shear localization, providing a-priori predictions for the displacement field associated with the plastic drops and the shear localization.</description>

      <title>Active Matter as a framework for living systems-inspired Robophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robophysics investigates the physical principles that govern living-like robots operating in complex, realworld environments. Despite remarkable technological advances, robots continue to face fundamental efficiency limitations. At the level of individual units, locomotion remains a challenge, while at the collective level, robot swarms struggle to achieve shared purpose, coordination, communication, and cost efficiency. This perspective article examines the key challenges faced by bio-inspired robotic collectives and highlights recent research efforts that incorporate principles from active-matter physics and biology into the modeling and design of robot swarms.</description>

      <title>Cell Shape Emerges from Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform cell segmentation on images from experimental studies of confluent, mobile cells in epithelial monolayers and show that these systems possess a broad, positively-skewed shape parameter distribution $P(\mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{A}=p^2/4\pi a$, $p$ is the perimeter, and $a$ is area of each cell. $P(\mathcal{A})$ is peaked at a value higher than the typical shape parameter $\mathcal{A}^* \sim 1.15$ that occurs for randomly packed, static confluent cell monolayers. The distribution does not arise from a heterogeneous population of cells with different {\it fixed} $\mathcal{A}$, nor can it arise from cell shape fluctuations from strains below the elastic limit. Instead, we find that all cells in each monolayer sample $\mathcal{A}$ values that span the full shape parameter distribution. We develop a deformable particle model that allows cell perimeter to adapt to local forces during cell motion, and this model recovers $P(\mathcal{A})$ to within $5\%$ for both MDCK and HaCaT epithelial cell monolayers. These results emphasize that confluent epithelial monolayers of mobile cells generate a well-defined broad shape parameter distribution that is independent of the initial cell shapes.</description>

      <title>From Equilibrium Multistability to Spatiotemporal Chaos in Channel Flows of Nematic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate channel-confined, nematic liquid crystals using the Beris-Edwards model of nematohydrodynamics. Using strong homeotropic anchoring at the walls, we find multistability i.e. multiple coexisting states where the uniform nematic state coexists with states having spatially varying scalar nematic order and director fields. When a pressure gradient is applied, flows develop, and the inherent multistability of the system organizes a variety of complex dynamics. For low pressure gradients, steady flows are established, and the director fields that emerge from the multistable states at equilibrium correspond to Bowser and Dowser configurations similar to those reported in experiments. An increasing pressure-gradient destabilizes steady Bowser and Dowser flow states sequentially, leading to unsteady periodic and chaotic regimes featuring cyclical topological transitions, pulsating flows, advecting defects and spatiotemporal chaos. These findings demonstrate that modest variations in the scalar nematic order, as captured by the Beris-Edwards model, can qualitatively modify equilibrium structures and give rise to complex nonequilibrium behaviour in confined nematics-contrasting with the Ericksen-Leslie model, which assumes a constant scalar order parameter. Our key model predictions - multistability, periodically oscillating states and advecting defect-mediated turbulence can be experimentally investigated in pressure-driven channel flows of nematic fluids.</description>

      <title>On Universal Deformations and Material Preferred Directions in Anisotropic Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study universal deformations in anisotropic Cauchy elasticity. We show that the universality constraints of hyperelasticity and Cauchy elasticity for transversely isotropic, orthotropic, and monoclinic solids are equivalent. This implies that for each of these symmetry classes the universal deformations and the corresponding universal material preferred directions of hyperelastic and Cauchy elastic solids are identical. This is consistent with previous findings for isotropic solids. Universal deformations and material preferred directions are therefore independent of the existence or absence of a strain energy function.</description>

      <title>On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Search by Return: Stochastic Resetting in Fluctuating Harmonic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic resetting (SR) processes in which a diffusing particle alternates between free motion and confinement by an externally controlled potential. When the particle is recaptured, it undergoes a return trajectory that drives it toward a designated reset point. In standard SR, such returns are treated as instantaneous, but in realistic setups they have finite duration and introduce imprecision in the starting points of subsequent search attempts. We analyze a fluctuating harmonic potential in which return trajectories are forcibly terminated the moment the particle reaches the origin, ensuring that all outward (diffusive) trajectories begin from the same point. This is implemented through instantaneous positional information: a feedback signal that shortens the return phase without incurring additional mechanical energetic cost. We examine several search protocols built on this controlled return mechanism and determine their mean first-passage times (MFPTs). Of particular interest is a protocol in which outward diffusion is eliminated entirely and the return motion itself becomes the search mechanism. This "search by return" perspective reverses the conventional logic of SR and yields a closed-form MFPT that highlights the efficiency of using return dynamics as the primary search strategy.</description>

      <title>Shear-driven memory effects in carbon black gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to developing smart materials whose mechanical properties can adapt under physical stimuli. Particulate colloidal gels, which behave as solids but can also flow under stress, have emerged as promising candidates. Resulting from the attractive interaction between their constituents, their network architecture exhibit solid-like properties even at very low volume fractions. This structural flexibility allows them to adopt various configurations and store structural information making them highly susceptible to memory effects. Shear flow, applied through rheometry, offers a simple and effective way to tune their properties and imprint a ``rheological memory'' of the flow history. However, the precise relationship between flow history and viscoelastic response remains elusive, largely due to the limited structural characterization of these systems during flow and after flow cessation. Here, we use ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) to reveal a strong structural memory in the solid state, where the microstructure formed under shear is retained after flow cessation. We identify two distinct mechanisms of structural memory, as governed by the ratio of viscous to attractive forces, namely, the Mason number. Using recently developed fractal scaling laws, we show that the rheology is fully determined by the gel microstructure. Notably, these gels exhibit a double-fractal architecture, highlighting the remarkably broad range of length scales over which these disordered materials are structured. By clarifying how memory is encoded, our results offer strategies to tune shear sensitivity of colloidal gels and design smart materials.</description>

      <title>Directed evolution effectively selects for DNA based physical reservoir computing networks capable of multiple tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA and other biopolymers are being investigated as new computing substrates and alternative to silicon-based digital computers. However, the established top-down design of biomolecular interaction networks remains challenging and does not fully exploit biomolecular self-assembly capabilities. Outside the field of computation, directed evolution has been used as a tool for goal directed optimization of DNA sequences. Here, we propose integrating directed evolution with DNA-based reservoir computing to enable in-material optimization and adaptation. Simulations of colloidal bead networks connected via DNA strands demonstrate a physical reservoir capable of non-linear time-series prediction tasks, including Volterra series and Mackey-Glass chaotic dynamics. Reservoir computing performance, quantified by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), strongly depends on network topology, suggesting task-specific optimal network configurations. Implementing genetic algorithms to evolve DNA-encoded network connectivity effectively identified well-performing reservoir networks. Directed evolution improved reservoir performance across multiple tasks, outperforming random network selection. Remarkably, sequential training on distinct tasks resulted in reservoir populations maintaining performance on prior tasks. Our findings indicate that DNA-bead networks offer sufficient complexity for reservoir computing, and that directed evolution robustly optimizes performance.</description>

      <title>Universality in the velocity jump in the crack propagation observed for food-wrapping films for daily use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The velocity jump found in the crack propagation for rubbers has been a powerful tool for developing tough rubber materials. Although it is suggested by a theory that the jump could be observed widely for viscoelastic materials, the report on a clear jump is very limited and, even in such a case, reproducibility is low, except for elastomers. Here, we use a mundane food-wrapping film as a sample and observe the crack propagation velocity with pulling the sample at a constant speed in the direction perpendicular to the crack. As a result, we find the jump occurs at a critical strain with high reproducibility. Remarkably, the plot of the crack-propagation velocity as a function of strain can be collapsed onto a master curve by an appropriate rescaling, where the master curve is found to be universal for change in the pulling speed and in the sample height. The result reveals a key parameter for the jump is the strain, suggesting the existence of a small length that governs the deformation along the crack. The present study sets limitations on future theories and opens an avenue for the velocity jump to become a tool for developing a wide variety of tough polymer-based materials.</description>

Abstract: Polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory, a descendent of Ornstein-Zernike liquid state theory, is a powerful tool to predict the structure and thermodynamics of equilibrium polymer systems, but its accuracy and applicability can be limited in some important cases. Typically, these shortcomings are traced to the analytical closure relationships used to solve the integral equations. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based closure relation trained on a dataset of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of homopolymer melts and solutions. PRISM theory with the ML closure outperforms traditional atomic closures (e.g., Percus-Yevick) in predicting the structure of typical coarse-grained model systems. We also use the ML closure to accurately model the results of small-angle neutron scattering experiments. This ML-enhanced PRISM theory can therefore enable rapid soft materials discovery and design efforts.</description>

      <title>Gravity-driven flux of particles through apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14415</link>

Abstract: The gravity-driven discharge of granular material through an aperture is a fundamental problem in granular physics and is classically described by empirical laws with different fitting parameters. In this Letter, we disentangle the mass flux into distinct velocity and packing contributions by combining three-dimensional experiments and simulations. We define a dimensionless flux ratio that captures confinement-driven deviations from a free-fall limit, which is recovered when the aperture is large compared to the grain size. For spherical cohesionless grains, the deviations from the free-fall limit are captured by a single exponential correction factor over a characteristic length scale of $\sim$ 10-15 grain diameters. This is shown to be the scale over which the packing structure is modified due to the boundary. Building on the $\sqrt{gD}$ exit-velocity scaling, we propose a kinematic framework that explains the universality of granular discharge beyond empirical descriptions.</description>

      <title>Spatially Correlated Noise Induces Transitions from the Diffusive to Ballistic Regime in Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02936v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating incompressible Navier--Stokes equation driven by spatially correlated thermal noise characterized by a single length scale. This formulation is constructed to preserve thermal equilibrium through the fluctuation--dissipation relation (FDR), which enforces the same spatial correlation in the viscous diffusion term and therefore gives rise to nonlocal momentum transport. Numerical simulations of tracer diffusion in fluids governed by this formulation reveal that the mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends monotonically on the correlation length $\ell$ and the correlation strength $\beta$. Intuitively, increasing $\ell$ enhances MSD and induces the emergence of an early-time ballistic regime, as a larger correlation length slows momentum diffusion. Counterintuitively, decreasing $\beta$ also increases the MSD, since a weaker correlation strength also retards momentum diffusion, whereas smaller $\ell$ or larger $\beta$ suppresses the ballistic regime and leads to a diffusive behavior. The emergence or suppression of the ballistic regime stems from how spatial correlations, incorporated through the FDR to maintain equilibrium, alter the effective momentum transport across scales. Interestingly, we further show that the resulting nonlocal diffusion is reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Local Point-Group-Symmetry Order in Complex Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties. In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation. Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>
