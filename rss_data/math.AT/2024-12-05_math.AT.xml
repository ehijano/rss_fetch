      <title>IntComplex for high-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs serve as powerful tools for modeling pairwise interactions in diverse fields such as biology, material science, and social networks. However, they inherently overlook interactions involving more than two entities. Simplicial complexes and hypergraphs have emerged as prominent frameworks for modeling many-body interactions; nevertheless, they exhibit limitations in capturing specific high-order interactions, particularly those involving transitions from $n$-interactions to $m$-interactions. Addressing this gap, we propose IntComplex as an innovative framework to characterize such high-order interactions comprehensively. Our framework leverages homology theory to provide a quantitative representation of the topological structure inherent in such interactions. IntComplex is defined as a collection of interactions, each of which can be equivalently represented by a binary tree. Drawing inspiration from GLMY homology, we introduce homology for the detailed analysis of structural patterns formed by interactions across adjacent dimensions, $p$-layer homology to elucidate loop structures within $p$-interactions in specific dimensions, and multilayer homology to analyze loop structures of interactions across multiple dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce persistent homology through a filtration process and establish its stability to ensure robust quantitative analysis of these complex interactions. The proposed IntComplex framework establishes a foundational paradigm for the analysis of topological properties in high-order interactions, presenting significant potential to drive forward the advancements in the domain of complex network analysis.</description>

      <title>Higher crossed modules of algebras over an operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study crossed modules in the context of algebras over an operad. To do so, in the first section, we adapt the methods of Janelidze by reviewing the notions of internal actions, precrossed modules and crossed modules in the operadic case. Moreover, we extract the Peiffer relations, well known in the Lie case, for precrossed modules over an arbitrary operad. We prove that our notion of crossed modules is equivalent to the one of Janelidze by proving that our crossed modules of algebras over a fixed operad are equivalent to categories internal to algebras over this fixed operad. In the second section, we study the notion of crossed modules of algebras over an operad as introduced by Leray-Riviere-Wagemann in arXiv:2411.04614 and prove it to be equivalent to the already existing notions of crossed modules. Roughly speaking, a crossed module in the sense of Leray-Rivi\`ere-Wagemann is an algebra structure on a chain complex concentrated in degrees 0 and 1. We highlight a "codescent" process which allows us to endow the degree one and zero terms of the chain complex with algebra structures such that the differential is an algebra morphism. Moreover, we prove it to be a crossed module. In fact we prove that the approach to crossed modules of Leray-Riviere-Wagemann is equivalent to the one of Janelidze. This new approach, together with the codescent process, allows us to introduce higher crossed modules in a very concise and explicit way, and we prove them to be equivalent to n-fold categories internal to algebras, for some n.</description>

      <title>Chain level Koszul duality between the Gravity and Hypercommutative operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ be the moduli space of genus zero stable curves with $(n+1)$-marked points. The collection $\overline{\mathcal{M}}=\{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}\}_{n\geq 2}$ forms an operad in the category of complex projective varieties; its homology $Hycom= H_*(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ is called the Hypercommutative operad. In this paper we construct a chain model for the hypercommutative operad, i.e. an operad of chain complexes $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ which is weakly equivalent to the operad of singular chains $C_*(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$. We prove that $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ is the linear dual of the bar construction $B(grav)$, where $grav$ is a chain model of the gravity operad based on cacti without basepoint. This shows that the Gravity and Hypercommutative operad are Koszul dual also at the chain level, refining a previous result of Getzler. The construction is topological, since $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})(n)$ is the cellular complex associated to a regular CW-decomposition of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$.</description>

      <title>The geometric diagonal of the special linear algebraic cobordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivic version of the $c_1$-spherical cobordism spectrum is constructed. A connection of this spectrum with other motivic Thom spectra is established. Using this connection, we compute the $\mathbb{P}^1$-diagonal of the homotopy groups of the special linear algebraic cobordism $\pi_{2*,*}(\mathrm{MSL})$ over a local Dedekind domain $k$ with $1/2\in k$ after inverting the exponential characteristic of the residue field of $k$. We discuss the action of the motivic Hopf element $\eta$ on this ring, obtain a description of the localization away from $2$ and compute the $2$-primary torsion subgroup. The complete answer is given in terms of the special unitary cobordism ring. An important component of the computation is the construction of Pontryagin characteristic numbers with values in the Hermitian K-theory. We also construct Chern numbers in this setting, prove the motivic version of the Anderson--Brown--Peterson theorem and briefly discuss classes of Calabi--Yau varieties in the $\mathrm{SL}$-cobordism ring.</description>

      <title>The Gestalt Computational Model by Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widely employed in cognitive psychology, Gestalt theory elucidates basic principles in visual perception. However, the Gestalt principles are validated mainly by psychological experiments, lacking quantitative research supports and theoretical coherence. In this paper, we utilize persistent homology, a mathematical tool in computational topology, to develop a unified computational model for Gestalt principles, addressing the challenges of quantification and computation. On the one hand, the Gestalt computational model presents quantitative supports for Gestalt theory. On the other hand, it shows that the Gestalt principles can be uniformly calculated using persistent homology, thus developing a coherent theory for Gestalt principles in computation. Moreover, it is anticipated that the Gestalt computational model can serve as a significant computational model in the field of computational psychology, and help the understanding of human being visual perception.</description>
