      <title>Asymptotic stability proof and port-Hamiltonian physics-informed neural network approach to chaotic synchronization in Hindmarsh-Rose neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study chaotic synchronization in a five-dimensional Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model augmented with electromagnetic induction and a switchable memristive autapse. For two diffusively coupled neurons, we derive the linearized error dynamics and prove global asymptotic stability of the synchronization manifold via a quadratic Lyapunov function. Verifiable sufficient conditions follow from Sylvester's criterion on the leading principal minors, and convergence is established using Barbalat's lemma. Leveraging Helmholtz's decomposition, we separate the error field into conservative and dissipative parts and obtain a closed-form expression for the synchronization energy, along with its dissipation law, providing a quantitative measure of the energetic cost of synchrony. Numerical simulations confirm complete synchronization, overall decay of the synchronization energy, and close agreement between Lyapunov and Hamiltonian diagnostics across parameter sweeps. Building on these results, we introduce a port-Hamiltonian physics-informed neural network that embeds the conservative/dissipative structure in training through physically motivated losses and structural priors. The learned Hamiltonian and energy-rate match analytical benchmarks. The framework narrows the gap between dynamical systems theory and data-driven discovery, and provides a template for energy-aware modeling and control of nonlinear neuronal synchronization.</description>

      <title>Interpretable disorder-promoted synchronization and coherence in coupled laser networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled lasers offer a promising approach to scaling the power output of photonic devices for applications demanding high frequency precision and beam coherence. However, maintaining coherence among lasers remains a fundamental challenge due to desynchronizing instabilities arising from time delay in the optical coupling. Here, we depart from the conventional notion that disorder is detrimental to synchronization and instead propose an interpretable mechanism through which heterogeneity in the laser parameters can be harnessed to promote synchronization. Our approach allows stabilization of pre-specified synchronous states that, while abundant, are often unstable in systems of identical lasers. The results show that stable synchronization enabling coherence can be frequently achieved by introducing intermediate levels of random mismatches in any of several laser constructive parameters. Our results establish a principled framework for enhancing coherence in large laser networks, offering a robust strategy for power scaling in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>The Less Intelligent the Elements, the More Intelligent the Whole. Or, Possibly Not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.12689v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The agent-based modelling community has a debate on how ``intelligent'' artificial agents should be, and in what ways their local intelligence relates to the emergence of a collective intelligence. I approach this debate by endowing the preys and predators of the Lotka-Volterra model with behavioral algorithms characterized by different levels of sophistication. The main finding is that by endowing both preys and predators with the capability of making predictions based on linear extrapolation a novel sort of dynamic equilibrium appears, where both species co-exist while both populations grow indefinitely. While this broadly confirms that, in general, relatively simple agents favor the emergence of complex collective behavior, it also suggests that one fundamental mechanism is that the capability of individuals to take first-order derivatives of one other's behavior can allow the collective computation of derivatives of any order.</description>

      <title>Balanced Dynamics in Strongly Coupled Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many mathematical models of interacting agents assume that individual interactions scale down in proportion to the network size, ensuring that the combined input received from the network does not diverge. In theoretical neuroscience, Sompolinsky and Van Vreeswijk proposed in 1996 that, should these scalings be violated (and under appropriate conditions), the system may not diverge but rather approach a balanced state where the inputs to each neuron compensate each other (in neuroscience, where inhibitory currents compensate the excitatory ones). We come back to this observation and formulate here a mathematical conjecture for the occurrence of such behaviors in general stochastic systems of interacting agents. From a mathematical viewpoint, this conjecture can be viewed as a double-limit problem in the space of probability measures, which we discuss in detail, as it provides several possible mathematical avenues for proving this result. We provide some numerical and theoretical explorations of the conjecture in classical models of neuronal networks. Moreover, we provide a complete proof of an asymptotic result consistent with one of the double-limit problems in a one-dimensional model with separable coupling inspired by models of chemically-coupled neurons. This proof relies on asymptotic methods, and particularly desingularization techniques used in some PDEs, that we apply here to the mean-field limit of the network as the coupling is made to diverge. From the applications viewpoint, this theory provides an alternative, minimalistic explanation for the widely observed balance of excitation and inhibition in the cerebral cortex not requiring the assumption of the existence of complex regulatory mechanisms.</description>
