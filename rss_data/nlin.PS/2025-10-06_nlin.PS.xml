      <title>Global bifurcation of localised 2D patterns emerging from spatial heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general approach to prove the existence, both locally and globally in amplitude, of fully localised multi-dimensional patterns in partial differential equations containing a compact spatial heterogeneity. While one-dimensional localised patterns induced by spatial heterogeneities have been well-studied, proving the existence of fully localised patterns emerging from a Turing instability in higher dimensions remains a key open problem in pattern formation. In order to demonstrate the approach, we consider the two-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation, whose linear bifurcation parameter is perturbed by a radially-symmetric potential function. In this case, the trivial state is unstable in a compact neighbourhood of the origin and linearly stable outside. We prove the existence of local bifurcation branches of fully localised patterns, characterise their stability and bifurcation structure, and then rigorously continue solutions to large amplitude via analytic global bifurcation theory. Notably, the primary bifurcating branch in the Swift-Hohenberg equation alternates between an axisymmetric spot and a non-axisymmetric `dipole' pattern, depending on the width of the spatial heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Rogue waves in extended Gross-Pitaevskii Models with a Lee-Huang-Yang correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the existence and dynamical generation of rogue waves (RWs) within a one dimensional quantum droplet bearing environment. RWs are computed by deploying a spacetime fixed point scheme to the relevant extended Gross Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). Parametric regions where the ensuing RWs are different from their counterparts in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are identified. To corroborate the controllable generation, relevant to ultracold atom experiments, of these rogue patterns we exploit two different protocols. The first is based on interfering dam break flows emanating from Riemann initial conditions and the second refers to the gradient catastrophe of a spatially localized waveform. A multitude of possible RWs are found in this system, spanning waveforms reminiscent of the Peregrine soliton, its spatially periodic variants, namely, the Akhmediev breathers, and other higher order RW solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Key elements of the shape of the corresponding eGPE RWs traced back to nonintegrability and the presence of competing interactions are discussed. Our results set the stage for probing a multitude of unexplored rogue like waveforms in such mixtures with competing interactions and should be accessible to current ultracold atom experiments.</description>
