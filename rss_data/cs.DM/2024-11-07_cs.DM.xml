      <title>Chorded Cycle Facets of Clique Partitioning Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities are a class of valid inequalities for the clique partitioning polytope. It is known that for $q = 2$ or $q = \tfrac{k-1}{2}$, these inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if $k$ is odd. We solve the open problem of characterizing such facets for arbitrary $k$ and $q$. More specifically, we prove that the $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if two conditions are satisfied: $k = 1$ mod $q$, and if $k=3q+1$ then $q=3$ or $q$ is even. This establishes the existence of many facets induced by $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities beyond those previously known.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of multiple strings of constant weight from prefix-suffix compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by studies of data retrieval in polymer-based storage systems, we consider the problem of reconstructing a multiset of binary strings that have the same length and the same weight from the compositions of their prefixes and suffixes of every possible length. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for which unique reconstruction up to reversal of the strings is possible. Additionally, we present two algorithms for reconstructing strings from the compositions of prefixes and suffixes of constant-length constant-weight strings.</description>

      <title>Noisy Linear Group Testing: Exact Thresholds and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In group testing, the task is to identify defective items by testing groups of them together using as few tests as possible. We consider the setting where each item is defective with a constant probability $\alpha$, independent of all other items. In the (over-)idealized noiseless setting, tests are positive exactly if any of the tested items are defective. We study a more realistic model in which observed test results are subject to noise, i.e., tests can display false positive or false negative results with constant positive probabilities. We determine precise constants $c$ such that $cn\log n$ tests are required to recover the infection status of every individual for both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing: in the former, the selection of groups to test can depend on previously observed test results, whereas it cannot in the latter. Additionally, for both settings, we provide efficient algorithms that identify all defective items with the optimal amount of tests with high probability. Thus, we completely solve the problem of binary noisy group testing in the studied setting.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs as Weighted Directed Self-Looped Graphs: Spectral Properties, Clustering, Cheeger Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs naturally arise when studying group relations and have been widely used in the field of machine learning. There has not been a unified formulation of hypergraphs, yet the recently proposed edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVW) modeling is one of the most generalized modeling methods of hypergraphs, i.e., most existing hypergraphs can be formulated as EDVW hypergraphs without any information loss to the best of our knowledge. However, the relevant algorithmic developments on EDVW hypergraphs remain nascent: compared to spectral graph theories, the formulations are incomplete, the spectral clustering algorithms are not well-developed, and one result regarding hypergraph Cheeger Inequality is even incorrect. To this end, deriving a unified random walk-based formulation, we propose our definitions of hypergraph Rayleigh Quotient, NCut, boundary/cut, volume, and conductance, which are consistent with the corresponding definitions on graphs. Then, we prove that the normalized hypergraph Laplacian is associated with the NCut value, which inspires our HyperClus-G algorithm for spectral clustering on EDVW hypergraphs. Finally, we prove that HyperClus-G can always find an approximately linearly optimal partitioning in terms of Both NCut and conductance. Additionally, we provide extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings from an empirical perspective.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Bencz\'ur and Karger demonstrated cut sparsifiers of near-linear size, with several applications throughout theoretical computer science. Subsequent extensions have yielded sparsifiers for hypergraph cuts and more recently linear codes over Abelian groups. A decade ago, Kogan and Krauthgamer asked about the sparsifiability of arbitrary constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). For this question, a trivial lower bound is the size of a non-redundant CSP instance, which admits, for each constraint, an assignment satisfying only that constraint (so that no constraint can be dropped by the sparsifier). For graph cuts, spanning trees are non-redundant instances.
  Our main result is that redundant clauses are sufficient for sparsification: for any CSP predicate R, every unweighted instance of CSP(R) has a sparsifier of size at most its non-redundancy (up to polylog factors). For weighted instances, we similarly pin down the sparsifiability to the so-called chain length of the predicate. These results precisely determine the extent to which any CSP can be sparsified. A key technical ingredient in our work is a novel application of the entropy method from Gilmer's recent breakthrough on the union-closed sets conjecture.
  As an immediate consequence of our main theorem, a number of results in the non-redundancy literature immediately extend to CSP sparsification. We also contribute new techniques for understanding the non-redundancy of CSP predicates. In particular, we give an explicit family of predicates whose non-redundancy roughly corresponds to the structure of matching vector families in coding theory. By adapting methods from the matching vector codes literature, we are able to construct an explicit predicate whose non-redundancy lies between $\Omega(n^{1.5})$ and $\widetilde{O}(n^{1.6})$, the first example with a provably non-integral exponent.</description>

      <title>On the satisfiability of random $3$-SAT formulas with $k$-wise independent clauses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of identifying the satisfiability threshold of random $3$-SAT formulas has received a lot of attention during the last decades and has inspired the study of other threshold phenomena in random combinatorial structures. The classical assumption in this line of research is that, for a given set of $n$ Boolean variables, each clause is drawn uniformly at random among all sets of three literals from these variables, independently from other clauses. Here, we keep the uniform distribution of each clause, but deviate significantly from the independence assumption and consider richer families of probability distributions. For integer parameters $n$, $m$, and $k$, we denote by $\DistFamily_k(n,m)$ the family of probability distributions that produce formulas with $m$ clauses, each selected uniformly at random from all sets of three literals from the $n$ variables, so that the clauses are $k$-wise independent. Our aim is to make general statements about the satisfiability or unsatisfiability of formulas produced by distributions in $\DistFamily_k(n,m)$ for different values of the parameters $n$, $m$, and $k$.</description>

      <title>The Converse of the Real Orthogonal Holant Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Holant theorem is a powerful tool for studying the computational complexity of counting problems in the Holant framework. Due to the great expressiveness of the Holant framework, a converse to the Holant theorem would itself be a very powerful counting indistinguishability theorem. The most general converse does not hold, but we prove the following, still highly general, version: if any two sets of real-valued signatures are Holant-indistinguishable, then they are equivalent up to an orthogonal transformation. This resolves a partially open conjecture of Xia (2010). Consequences of this theorem include the well-known result that homomorphism counts from all graphs determine a graph up to isomorphism, the classical sufficient condition for simultaneous orthogonal similarity of sets of real matrices, and a combinatorial characterization of simultaneosly orthogonally decomposable (odeco) sets of symmetric tensors.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{S}$-adic characterization of minimal dendric shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dendric shifts are defined by combinatorial restrictions of the extensions of the words in their languages. This family generalizes well-known families of shifts such as Sturmian shifts, Arnoux-Rauzy shifts and codings of interval exchange transformations. It is known that any minimal dendric shift has a primitive $\mathcal{S}$-adic representation where the morphisms in $\mathcal{S}$ are positive tame automorphisms of the free group generated by the alphabet. In this paper we give an $\mathcal{S}$-adic characterization of this family by means of two finite graphs. As an application, we are able to decide whether a shift space generated by a uniformly recurrent morphic word is (eventually) dendric.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Metric Voting Distortion Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following well-studied problem of metric distortion in social choice. Suppose we have an election with $n$ voters and $m$ candidates located in a shared metric space. We would like to design a voting rule that chooses a candidate whose average distance to the voters is small. However, instead of having direct access to the distances in the metric space, the voting rule obtains, from each voter, a ranked list of the candidates in order of distance. Can we design a rule that regardless of the election instance and underlying metric space, chooses a candidate whose cost differs from the true optimum by only a small factor (known as the distortion)?
  A long line of work culminated in finding optimal deterministic voting rules with metric distortion $3$. However, for randomized voting rules, there is still a gap in our understanding: Even though the best lower bound is $2.112$, the best upper bound is still $3$, attained even by simple rules such as Random Dictatorship. Finding a randomized rule that guarantees distortion $3 - \epsilon$ has been a major challenge in computational social choice, as prevalent approaches to designing voting rules are known to be insufficient. Such a voting rule must use information beyond aggregate comparisons between pairs of candidates, and cannot only assign positive probability to candidates that are voters' top choices.
  In this work, we give a rule that guarantees distortion less than $2.753$. To do so we study a handful of voting rules that are new to the problem. One is Maximal Lotteries, a rule based on the Nash equilibrium of a natural zero-sum game which dates back to the 60's. The others are novel rules that can be thought of as hybrids of Random Dictatorship and the Copeland rule. Though none of these rules can beat distortion $3$ alone, a randomization between Maximal Lotteries and any of the novel rules can.</description>

      <title>Reducing Matroid Optimization to Basis Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matroids provide one of the most elegant structures for algorithm design. This is best identified by the Edmonds-Rado theorem relating the success of the simple greedy algorithm to the anatomy of the optimal basis of a matroid [Edm71; Rad57]. As a response, much energy has been devoted to understanding a matroid's computational properties. Yet, less is understood where parallel algorithms are concerned. In response, we initiate the study of parallel matroid optimization in the adaptive complexity model [BS18]. First, we reexamine Bor\r{u}vka's classical minimum weight spanning tree algorithm [Bor26b; Bor26a] in the abstract language of matroid theory, and identify a new certificate of optimality for the basis of any matroid as a result. In particular, a basis is optimal if and only if it contains the points of minimum weight in every circuit of the dual matroid. Hence, we can witnesses whether any specific point belongs to the optimal basis via a test for local optimality in a circuit of the dual matroid, thereby revealing a general design paradigm towards parallel matroid optimization. To instantiate this paradigm, we use the special structure of a binary matroid to identify an optimization scheme with low adaptivity. Here, our key technical step is reducing optimization to the simpler task of basis search in the binary matroid, using only logarithmic overhead of adaptive rounds of queries to independence oracles. Consequentially, we compose our reduction with the parallel basis search method of [KUW88] to obtain an algorithm for finding the optimal basis of a binary matroid terminating in sublinearly many adaptive rounds of queries to an independence oracle. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first algorithm for matroid optimization to outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of adaptive complexity in the independence query model without assuming the matroid is encoded by a graph.</description>
