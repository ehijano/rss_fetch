      <title>Intermediate subgroups of braid groups are not bi-orderable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be the disk or a compact, connected surface without boundary different from the sphere $S^2$ and the real projective plane $\mathbb{R}P^2$, and let $N$ be a compact, connected surface (possibly with boundary). It is known that the pure braid groups $P_n(M)$ of $M$ are bi-orderable, and, for $n\geq 3$, that the full braid groups $B_n(M)$ of $M$ are not bi-orderable. The main purpose of this article is to show that for all $n \geq 3$, any subgroup $H$ of $B_n(N)$ that satisfies $P_n(N) \subsetneq H \subset B_n(N)$ is not bi-orderable.</description>

      <title>Doubles without open book decompositions from higher signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in every even dimension there are closed manifolds that are doubles, but have no open book decomposition. In high dimensions, this contradicts the conclusions in Ranicki's book on high-dimensional knot theory. In all dimensions, examples arise from the non-multiplicativity of the signature in fibre bundles. We discuss many examples and applications in dimension four, where this phenomenon is related to the simplicial volume.</description>

      <title>Twisted Alexander vanishing order of knots II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced the notion of the twisted Alexander vanishing order of knots, defined as the order of the smallest finite group for which the corresponding twisted Alexander polynomial vanishes. In this paper, we explore several properties of this invariant in detail and present a list of twisted Alexander vanishing groups of order less than $201$.</description>

      <title>Geodesic-preserving bijections of the Thurston geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely classify the bijections of the Thurston geometries that preserve geodesics as sets. For Riemannian manifolds that satisfy a certain technical condition, we prove that a totally geodesic subset is a submanifold. We also classify the geodesic-preserving bijections of the Euclidean cylinder $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{R}$ and the bijections of the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$ that preserve constant curvature curves.</description>

      <title>On torsion in the homology of the Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_g$ be a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$, and let $\operatorname{Mod}(S_g)$ denote its mapping class group. The Torelli group $\mathcal{I}_g$ is the subgroup of $\operatorname{Mod}(S_g)$ consisting of mapping classes that act trivially on $H_1(S_g)$. For any collection of pairwise disjoint, separating simple closed curves on $S_g$, the corresponding Dehn twists pairwise commute and determine a homology class in $H_k(\mathcal{I}_g)$, which is called an abelian cycle. We prove that the subgroup of $H_k(\mathcal{I}_g)$ generated by such abelian cycles is a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-vector space for all $k$, and that it is finite-dimensional for $k = 2$ and $g \geq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the pseudo-effective cone of divisors of $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ is not polyhedral for $n\geq 8$ by constructing an extremal non-polyhedral ray of the dual cone of moving curves via maps on meromorphic strata of differentials returning the residues at the poles of the parameterised differentials. An immediate corollary is that these spaces are not Mori Dream Spaces.</description>

      <title>Extending degree-2 Azumaya algebras with C2-actions and examples from character varieties of knot group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give criteria to determine when a degree-2 Azumaya algebra with $C_2$-action over a dense open subvariety of a curve extends to the entire curve as an algebra with $C_2$-action. These consist of conditions for the extension of the algebra, combined with a new condition for the extension of the algebra with the action. The new condition is testable by computer algebra systems, and we explain how the result applies to the canonical components of the character varieties of certain hyperbolic knots with order-2 symmetries. We conclude by carrying out the calculations for different symmetries of the Figure-8 knot.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence: Lipschitz functions with converging Clarke subdifferentials and convergence of sets defined by converging equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we investigate some applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed sets in analysis that are motivated also by questions from singularity theory. First, we generalise to Lipschitz functions the classical theorem stating that given a sequence of smooth functions with locally uniformly convergent derivatives, we obtain the local uniform convergence of the functions themselves (provided they were convergent at one point). We use Clarke subdifferentials instead of derivative and Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of their graphs instead of local uniform convergence. Next we focus on reverse theorem. We show that Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed nonempty sets implies convergence of distance functions and Clark subdifferentials of squared distance functions, but does not imply convergence of Clark subdifferentials of distance functions. Finally we turn to the study of the behaviour of the fibres of a given function. We prove some general real counterparts of the Hurwitz theorem from complex analysis stating that the local uniform convergence of holomorphic functions implies the convergence of their sets of zeros. From the point of view of singularity theory our two theorems concern the convergence of the sets when their descriptions are convergent. They are also of interest in approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Invariant quasimorphisms and generalized mixed Bavard duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides an expository account of the celebrated duality theorem of Bavard and three its strengthenings. The Bavard duality theorem connects scl (stable commutator length) and quasimorphisms on a group. Calegari extended the framework from a group element to a chain on the group, and established the generalized Bavard duality. Kawasaki, Kimura, Matsushita and Mimura studied the setting of a pair of a group and its normal subgroup, and obtained the mixed Bavard duality. The first half of the present article is devoted to an introduction to these three Bavard dualities. In the latter half, we present a new strengthening, the generalized mixed Bavard duality, and provide a self-contained proof of it. This third strengthening recovers all of the Bavard dualities treated in the first half; thus, we supply complete proofs of these four Bavard dualities in a unified manner. In addition, we state several results on the space $\mathrm{W}(G,N)$ of non-extendable quasimorphisms, which is related to the comparison problem between scl and mixed scl via the mixed Bavard duality.</description>

      <title>Simplicial volume via foliated simplices and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a triangulated oriented closed connected manifold with universal cover $\widetilde{M}\to M$ and fundamental group $\Gamma=\pi_1(M)$ and consider an essentially free measure preserving action $\Gamma\curvearrowright (X,\mu)$ on a standard Borel probability space. We study the space $\Gamma\backslash(\widetilde{M}\times X)$ equipped with the measured foliation defined by Sauer and the theory of singular foliated simplices in this setting. We define its real singular foliated homology and compare it to classical singular homology. In particular, we construct a foliated fundamental class and prove that its norm coincides with the simplicial volume of $M$, formalizing ideas of Gromov. Passing to the dual chain complex, we define the singular foliated bounded cohomology. When $M$ is aspherical we establish an isometric isomorphism with the measurable bounded cohomology of the action groupoid $\Gamma\curvearrowright X$. As a consequence of a foliated duality principle, we odeduce vanishing criteria for the simplicial volume of $M$ in terms of the vanishing of the measurable bounded cohomology of the action groupoid and/or of its transverse groupoids.</description>

As an application, we show that the $A$-polynomial of prime knots in $S^3$ is a profinite invariant, up to possible mirror image.</description>

Abstract: In \cite{NST23}, Nozaki-Sato-Taniguchi defined a family of invariants $ r_s $ for integer homology spheres with filtered instanton homology \cite{FS92}. Coupling these with techniques in classical knot theory, we produce some results in the knot concordance group, including criteria for a family of satellite knots to be linearly independent and the independence of what we call the Whitehead $ n $-ble $ P_n $.</description>

      <title>A tale of two moduli spaces: logarithmic and multi-scale differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-scale differentials were constructed by M.~Bainbridge, D.~Chen, Q.~Gendron, S.~Grushevsky, and M.~M\"oller, from the viewpoint of flat and complex geometry, for the purpose of compactifying moduli spaces of curves together with a differential with prescribed orders of zeros and poles. Logarithmic differentials were constructed by S.~Marcus and J.~Wise, as a generalization of stable rubber maps from Gromov--Witten theory. Modulo the global residue condition that isolates the main components of the compactification, we show that these two kinds of differentials are equivalent, and establish an isomorphism of their (coarse) moduli stacks. Moreover, we describe the rubber and multi-scale spaces as an explicit blowup of the moduli space of stable pointed rational curves in the case of genus zero, and as a global blowup of the incidence variety compactification for arbitrary genera, which implies their projectivity. We also propose a refined double ramification cycle formula in the twisted Hodge bundle which interacts with the universal line bundle class.</description>

      <title>An algebraic criterion for the vanishing of bounded cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16259v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the vanishing of bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients for many groups of interest in geometry, dynamics, and algebra. These include compactly supported structure-preserving diffeomorphism groups of certain manifolds; the group of interval exchange transformations of the half line; piecewise linear and piecewise projective groups of the line, giving strong answers to questions of Calegari and Navas; direct limit linear groups of relevance in algebraic $K$-theory, thereby answering a question by Kastenholz and Sroka and a question of two of the authors and L{\"o}h; and certain subgroups of big mapping class groups, such as the stable braid group and the stable mapping class group, proving a conjecture of Bowden. Moreover, we prove that in the recently introduced framework of enumerated groups, the generic group has vanishing bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients. At the heart of our approach is an elementary algebraic criterion called the commuting cyclic conjugates condition that is readily verifiable for the aforementioned large classes of groups.</description>
