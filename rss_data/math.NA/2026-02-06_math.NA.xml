      <title>A uniformly accurate multiscale time integrator for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in the nonrelativistic regime via simplified transmission conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new and simplified multiscale time integrator Fourier pseudospectral (MTI-FP) method for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter epsilon in (0,1] inversely proportional to the speed of light, and establish its uniform first-order accuracy in time in the nonrelativistic regime, i.e. 0 &lt; epsilon &lt;&lt; 1. In this regime, the solution of the NKGE is highly oscillatory in time with O(epsilon^2)-wavelength, which brings significant difficulties in designing uniformly accurate numerical methods. The MTI-FP is based on (i) a multiscale decomposition by frequency of the NKGE in each time interval with simplified transmission conditions, and (ii) an exponential wave integrator for temporal discretization and a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization. By adapting the energy method and the mathematical induction, we obtain two error bounds in H1-norm at O(h^{m0}+tau^2/epsilon^2) and O(h^{m0}+tau+epsilon^2) with mesh size h, time step tau and m0 an integer dependent on the regularity of the solution, which immediately implies a uniformly accurate error bound O(h^{m0}+tau) with respect to epsilon in (0,1]. In addition, by adopting a linear interpolation of the micro variables with the multiscale decomposition in each time interval, we obtain a uniformly accurate numerical solution for any time t larger than zero. Thus the proposed MTI-FP method has a super resolution property in time in terms of the Shannon sampling theory, i.e. accurate numerical solutions can be obtained even when the time step is much bigger than the O(epsilon^2)-wavelength. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds and demonstrate their super resolution in time. Finally the proposed MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically convergence rates of the NKGE to its different limiting models in the nonrelativistic regime.</description>

      <title>Acoustic scattering by fractal inhomogeneities via geometry-conforming Galerkin methods for the Lippmann-Schwinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a numerical method for time-harmonic acoustic scattering in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n=2,3$, by a class of inhomogeneities (penetrable scatterers) with fractal boundary. Our method is based on a Galerkin discretisation of the Lippmann-Schwinger volume integral equation, using a discontinuous piecewise-polynomial approximation space on a geometry-conforming mesh comprising elements which themselves have fractal boundary. We first provide a semi-discrete well-posedness and error analysis for both the $h$- and $p$-versions of our method for completely arbitrary inhomogeneities (without any regularity assumption on the boundary of the inhomogeneity or of the mesh elements). We prove convergence estimates for the integral equation solution and superconvergence estimates for linear functionals such as scattered field and far-field pattern evaluations, and elucidate how the regularity of the inhomogeneity boundary and the regularity of the refractive index affect the rates of convergence predicted. We then specialise to the case where the inhomogeneity is an ``$n$-attractor'', i.e.\ the fractal attractor of an iterated function system satisfying the open set condition with non-empty interior, showing how in this case the self-similarity of the inhomogeneity can be used to generate geometry-conforming meshes. For the $h$-version with piecewise constant approximation we also present singular quadrature rules, supported by a fully discrete error analysis, permitting practical implementation of our method. We present numerical results for two-dimensional examples, which validate our theoretical results and show that our method is significantly more accurate than a comparable method involving replacement of the fractal inhomogeneity by a smoother prefractal approximation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Fixed-Point Framework for High-Dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, mesh-free, and gradient-free fixed-point approach for computing viscosity solutions of high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. By leveraging the Hopf-Lax formula, our approach iteratively solves the associated variational problem via a Picard iteration, enabling efficient evaluation of both the solution and its corresponding control without relying on grids, characteristics, or differentiation. We demonstrate the practical efficacy and scalability of the approach through numerical experiments in up to 100 dimensions, including control problems and non-smooth solutions. Our results show that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy, is highly efficient, and exhibits computational times that are largely independent of dimensionality, highlighting its suitability for high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Numerically Informed Convolutional Operator Network with Subproblem Decomposition for Poisson Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have shown remarkable performance in approximating solutions of partial differential equations. However, their convergence behavior under grid refinement is still not well understood from the viewpoint of numerical analysis. In this work, we propose a numerically informed convolutional operator network, called NICON, that explicitly couples classical finite difference and finite element methods with operator learning through residual-based training loss functions. We introduce two types of networks, FD-CON and FE-CON, which use residual-based loss functions derived from the corresponding numerical methods. We derive error estimates for FD-CON and FE-CON using finite difference and finite element analysis. These estimates show a direct relation between the convergence behavior and the decay rate of the training loss. From these analyses, we establish training strategies that guarantee optimal convergence rates under grid refinement. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical results and show performance on fine grids.</description>

      <title>Linear Systems and Eigenvalue Problems: Open Questions from a Simons Workshop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a series of open questions arising in matrix computations, i.e., the numerical solution of linear algebra problems. It is a result of working groups at the workshop \emph{Linear Systems and Eigenvalue Problems}, which was organized at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing program on \emph{Complexity and Linear Algebra} in Fall 2025. The complexity and numerical solution of linear algebra problems %in matrix computations and related fields is a crosscutting area between theoretical computer science and numerical analysis. The value of the particular problem formulations here is that they were produced via discussions between researchers from both groups.
  The open questions are organized in five categories: iterative solvers for linear systems, eigenvalue computation, low-rank approximation, randomized sketching, and other areas including tensors, quantum systems, and matrix functions.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Accelerated Neural Network Interpolation Operators on Irregular Grids with Higher Order Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new class of \emph{Taylor-accelerated neural network interpolation operators} is introduced on quasi-uniform irregular grids. These operators improve existing neural network interpolation operators by incorporating Taylor polynomials at the sampling nodes, thereby exploiting the higher smoothness of the target function. The proposed operators are shown to be well defined, uniformly bounded, and to satisfy an exact interpolation property at the grid points. In addition, polynomial reproduction up to a prescribed degree is established. Direct approximation estimates are derived in terms of higher-order moduli of smoothness, yielding enhanced convergence rates for sufficiently smooth functions. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement achieved through the Taylor-accelerated construction. In particular, higher-order convergence on irregular grids is obtained, and the proposed approach outperforms existing neural network interpolation operators on irregular partitions, including Lagrange-based schemes.</description>

      <title>Numerical stationary states for nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations via fixed points of consistency maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fixed-point-based numerical framework for computing stationary states of nonlocal Fokker-Planck-type equations. Instead of discretising the differential operators directly, we reformulate the stationary problem as a nonlinear fixed-point map built from the original PDE and its nonlocal interaction terms, and solve the resulting finite-dimensional problem with a matrix-free Newton-Krylov method. We compare implementations using the analytic Frechet derivative of this map with a simple central-difference approximation. Because the method does not rely on time evolution, it is agnostic to dynamical stability and can detect both stable and unstable stationary states. Its accuracy is determined mainly by the numerical treatment of convolutions and quadrature, rather than by differentiation stencils. We apply the approach to three model problems with linear diffusion, use existing analytical results to verify the outputs, and reproduce known bifurcation diagrams, as well as new bifurcation behaviour not previously observed in this kind of problem.</description>

      <title>A penalized {\phi}-FEM scheme for the Poisson Dirichlet problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze a penalized variant of the {\phi}-FEM scheme for the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The {\phi}-FEM is a recently introduced unfitted finite element method based on a level-set description of the geometry, which avoids the need for boundary-fitted meshes. Unlike the original {\phi}-FEM formulation, the method proposed here enforces boundary conditions through a penalization term. This approach has the advantage that the level-set function is required only on the cells adjacent to the boundary in the variational formulation. The scheme is stabilized using a ghost penalty technique. We derive a priori error estimates, showing optimal convergence in the H1 semi-norm and quasi-optimal convergence in the L2 norm under suitable regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical results and to compare the proposed method with both the original {\phi}-FEM and the standard fitted finite element method.</description>

      <title>Finite element approximation for a reformulation of a 3D fluid-2D plate interaction system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a finite element approximation of a coupled fluid-structure interaction consisting of a three-dimensional incompressible viscous fluid governed by the unsteady Stokes equations and a two-dimensional elastic plate. To avoid the use of $H^2-$conforming or nonconforming $\mathbb{P}_2$-Morley plate elements, the fourth-order plate equation is reformulated into a system of coupled second-order equations using an auxiliary variable. The coupling condition is enforced using a Lagrange multiplier representing the trace of the mean-zero fluid pressure on the interface.
  We establish well-posedness and stability results for the time-discrete and fully-discrete problems, and derive a priori error estimates. A partitioned domain decomposition algorithm based on a fixed-point iteration is employed for the numerical solution. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical rates of convergence in space and time using manufactured solutions, and demonstrate the applicability of the method to a physical problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary closures for diagonal-norm upwind SBP operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing non-equispaced grid points near boundaries, boundary-optimized upwind finite-difference operators of orders up to nine are developed. The boundary closures are constructed within a diagonal-norm summation-by-parts (SBP) framework, ensuring linear stability on piecewise curvilinear multiblock grids. Boundary and interface conditions are imposed using either weak enforcement through simultaneous approximation terms (SAT) or strong enforcement via the projection method.
  The proposed operators yield significantly improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with SBP operators constructed on equidistant grids. The resulting SBP--SAT and SBP--projection discretizations produce fully explicit systems of ordinary differential equations. The accuracy and stability properties of the proposed operators are demonstrated through numerical experiments for linear hyperbolic problems in one spatial dimension and for the compressible Euler equations in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Perturbation-Correction Method Based on Local Randomized Neural Networks for Quasi-Linear Interface Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quasi-linear interface problems with discontinuous diffusion coefficients, the nonconvex objective functional often leads to optimization stagnation in randomized neural network approximations. This paper Proposes a perturbation-correction framework based on Loacal Randomized Neural Networks(LRaNNs) to overcome this limitation. In the initialization step, a satisisfactory based approximation is obtained by minimizing the original nonconvex residual, typically stagnating at a moderate accuracy level. Subsequently, in the correction step, a correction term is determined by solving a subproblem governed by a perturbation expansion around the base approximation. This reformulation yields a convex optimization problem for the output coefficients, which guarantees rapic convergence. We rigorously derive an a posteriori error estitmate, demonstrating that the total generalization error is governed by the discrete residual norm, quadrature error, and a controllable truncation error. Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion problems with irregular moving interfaces, gradient-dependent diffusivities, and high-contrast media demonstrate that the proposed method effectively overcomes the optimization plateau. The correction step yields a significant improvement of 4-6 order of magnitude in L^2 accuracy.</description>

      <title>SpectraKAN: Conditioning Spectral Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Radon--Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Interacting-Particle Sampling in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, such as the Fokker--Planck equation and Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evolve a distribution toward a target density known only up to a normalizing constant. We introduce new gradient flows of the KL divergence with a remarkable combination of properties: they admit accurate interacting-particle approximations in high dimensions, and the per-step cost scales linearly in both the number of particles and the dimension. These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the PML method for thermoelastic wave scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the thermoelastic obstacle scattering problem in three dimensions. A uniaxial perfectly matched layer (PML) method is firstly introduced to truncate the unbounded scattering problem, leading to a truncated PML problem in a bounded domain. Under certain constraints on model parameters, the well-posedness for the truncated PML problem is then proved except possibly for a discrete set of frequencies, based on the analytic Fredholm theory. Moreover, the exponential convergence of the uniaxial PML method is established in terms of the thickness and absorbing parameters of PML layer. The proof is based on the PML extension technique and the exponential decay properties of the modified fundamental solution. As far as we know, this is the first convergence result of the PML method for the time-harmonic thermoelastic scattering problem.</description>

      <title>A term-by-term variational multiscale method with dynamic subscales for incompressible turbulent aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational multiscale (VMS) methods offer a robust framework for handling under-resolved flow scales without resorting to problem-specific turbulence models. Here, we propose and assess a dynamic, term-by-term VMS stabilized formulation for simulating incompressible flows from laminar to turbulent regimes. The method is embedded in an incremental pressure-correction fractional-step framework and employs a minimal set of stabilization terms, yielding a unified discretization that (i) allows equal-order velocity--pressure interpolation and (ii) provides robust control of convection-dominated dynamics in complex three-dimensional settings. Orthogonal projections are a key ingredient and ensure that the non-residual, term-by-term structure induces dissipation through dynamic subscales suitable for turbulent simulations. The methodology is validated on large-scale external-aerodynamics configurations, including the Ahmed body at Re $ = 7.68\times 10^{5}$ for multiple slant angles, using unstructured tetrahedral meshes ranging from 3 to 40 million elements. Applicability is further demonstrated on a realistic Formula~1 configuration at $U_\infty=56~\mathrm{m/s}$ (201.6~km/h), corresponding to Re $ \approx 10^{6}$. The results show that the proposed stabilized pressure-segregated formulation remains robust at scale and captures key separated-flow features and coherent wake organization. Pointwise velocity and pressure spectra provide an a posteriori consistency indicator, exhibiting finite frequency ranges compatible with inertial-subrange reference slopes in the resolved band and supporting dissipation control in under-resolved regimes within a unified stabilized finite element framework.</description>

      <title>Wedge Sampling: Efficient Tensor Completion with Nearly-Linear Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Wedge Sampling, a new non-adaptive sampling scheme for low-rank tensor completion. We study recovery of an order-$k$ low-rank tensor of dimension $n \times \cdots \times n$ from a subset of its entries. Unlike the standard uniform entry model (i.e., i.i.d. samples from $[n]^k$), wedge sampling allocates observations to structured length-two patterns (wedges) in an associated bipartite sampling graph. By directly promoting these length-two connections, the sampling design strengthens the spectral signal that underlies efficient initialization, in regimes where uniform sampling is too sparse to generate enough informative correlations.
  Our main result shows that this change in sampling paradigm enables polynomial-time algorithms to achieve both weak and exact recovery with nearly linear sample complexity in $n$. The approach is also plug-and-play: wedge-sampling-based spectral initialization can be combined with existing refinement procedures (e.g., spectral or gradient-based methods) using only an additional $\tilde{O}(n)$ uniformly sampled entries, substantially improving over the $\tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ sample complexity typically required under uniform entry sampling for efficient methods. Overall, our results suggest that the statistical-to-computational gap highlighted in Barak and Moitra (2022) is, to a large extent, a consequence of the uniform entry sampling model for tensor completion, and that alternative non-adaptive measurement designs that guarantee a strong initialization can overcome this barrier.</description>

      <title>Towards uncertainty quantification of a model for cancer-on-chip experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is a first step towards using data-informed differential models to predict and control the dynamics of cancer-on-chip experiments. We consider a conceptualized one-dimensional device, containing a cancer and a population of white blood cells. The interaction between the cancer and the population of cells is modeled by a chemotaxis model inspired by Keller-Segel-type equations, which is solved by a Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin method. Our goal is using (synthetic) data to tune the parameters of the governing equations and to assess the uncertainty on the predictions of the dynamics due to the residual uncertainty on the parameters remaining after the tuning procedure. To this end, we apply techniques from uncertainty quantification for parametric differential models. We first perform a global sensitivity analysis using both Sobol and Morris indices to assess how parameter uncertainty impacts model predictions, and fix the value of parameters with negligible impact. Subsequently, we conduct an inverse uncertainty quantification analysis by Bayesian techniques to compute a data-informed probability distribution of the remaining model parameters. Finally, we carry out a forward uncertainty quantification analysis to compute the impact of the updated (residual) parametric uncertainties on the quantities of interest of the model. The whole procedure is sped up by using surrogate models, based on sparse-grids, to approximate the mapping of the uncertain parameters to the quantities of interest.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model's Generalization Can Be Characterized by Inductive Biases toward a Data-Dependent Ridge Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a diffusion model is not memorizing the training data set, how does it generalize exactly? A quantitative understanding of the distribution it generates would be beneficial to, for example, an assessment of the model's performance for downstream applications. We thus explicitly characterize what diffusion model generates, by proposing a log-density ridge manifold and quantifying how the generated data relate to this manifold as inference dynamics progresses. More precisely, inference undergoes a reach-align-slide process centered around the ridge manifold: trajectories first reach a neighborhood of the manifold, then align as being pushed toward or away from the manifold in normal directions, and finally slide along the manifold in tangent directions. Within the scope of this general behavior, different training errors will lead to different normal and tangent motions, which can be quantified, and these detailed motions characterize when inter-mode generations emerge. More detailed understanding of training dynamics will lead to more accurate quantification of the generation inductive bias, and an example of random feature model will be considered, for which we can explicitly illustrate how diffusion model's inductive biases originate as a composition of architectural bias and training accuracy, and how they evolve with the inference dynamics. Experiments on synthetic multimodal distributions and MNIST latent diffusion support the predicted directional effects, in both low- and high-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dual Numbers for Arbitrary Order Automatic Differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual numbers are a well-established tool for computing derivatives and constitute the basis of forward-mode automatic differentiation. While the theoretical framework for computing derivatives of arbitrary order is well understood, practical and scalable implementations remain limited. Existing approaches based on nested dual numbers, such as those used in modern high-level languages, suffer from severe memory growth and poor scalability as the derivative order increases. In this work, we introduce DNAOAD, a Fortran-based automatic differentiation framework capable of computing derivatives of arbitrary order using dual numbers with a direct, non-nested representation. By avoiding recursive data structures, DNAOAD significantly reduces memory usage and enables the efficient computation of derivatives of very high order, overcoming key scalability limitations of existing methods and making it particularly well suited for high-performance scientific computing applications.</description>

Abstract: We construct a Neural Network that approximates the matrix multiplication operator for any activation function such that there exists a Neural Network which can approximate the scalar multiplication function. In particular, we use the Strassen algorithm to reduce the number of weights and layers needed for such Neural Networks. This allows us to define another Neural Network for approximating the inverse matrix operator. Also, by relying on the Galerkin method, we apply those Neural Networks to solve parametric elliptic PDEs for a whole set of parameters. Finally, we discuss improvements with respect to the prior results.</description>

      <title>Solving the Fokker-Planck equation of discretized Dean-Kawasaki models with functional hierarchical tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel numerical scheme for solving the Fokker-Planck equation of discretized Dean-Kawasaki models with a functional tensor network ansatz. The Dean-Kawasaki model describes density fluctuations of interacting particle systems, and it is a highly singular stochastic partial differential equation. By performing a finite-volume discretization of the Dean-Kawasaki model, we derive a stochastic differential equation (SDE). To fully characterize the discretized Dean-Kawasaki model, we solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation of the SDE dynamics. In particular, we use a particle-based approach whereby the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation is obtained by performing a series of density estimation tasks from the simulated trajectories, and we use a functional hierarchical tensor model to represent the density. To address the challenge that the sample trajectories are supported on a simplex, we apply a coordinate transformation from the simplex to a Euclidean space by logarithmic parameterization, after which we apply a sketching-based density estimation procedure on the transformed variables. Our approach is general and can be applied to general density estimation tasks over a simplex. We apply the proposed method successfully to the 1D and 2D Dean-Kawasaki models. Moreover, we show that the proposed approach is highly accurate in the presence of external potential and particle interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) method for the approximation of plane wave scattering by periodic diffraction gratings, modelled by the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. The periodic obstacle may include penetrable and impenetrable regions. The TDG method requires the approximation of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator on the periodic cell faces, and relies on plane wave discrete spaces. For polygonal meshes, all linear-system entries can be computed analytically. Using a Rellich identity, we prove a new explicit stability estimate for the Helmholtz solution, which is robust in the small material jump limit.</description>

      <title>The pollution effect for FEM approximations of the Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximation properties of solutions to the Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) in finite element spaces. Special attention is given to how the errors are influenced by coupling the mesh size $h$ and the polynomial degree $p$ of the finite element space to the size of the so-called Ginzburg-Landau material parameter $\kappa$. As observed in previous works, the finite element approximations to the GLE are suffering from a numerical pollution effect, that is, the best-approximation error in the finite element space converges under mild coupling conditions between $h$ and $\kappa$, whereas the actual finite element solutions possess poor accuracy in a large pre-asymptotic regime which depends on $\kappa$. In this paper, we provide a new error analysis that allows us to quantify the pre-asymptotic regime and the corresponding pollution effect in terms of explicit resolution conditions. In particular, we are able to prove that higher polynomial degrees reduce the pollution effect, i.e., the accuracy of the best-approximation is achieved under relaxed conditions for the mesh size. We provide both error estimates in the $H^1$- and the $L^2$-norm and we illustrate our findings with numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lax-Wendroff methods combined with discontinuous Galerkin/flux reconstruction spatial discretization provide a high-order, single-stage, quadrature-free method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. In this work, we introduce automatic differentiation (AD) for performing the Cauchy-Kowalewski procedure used in the element-local time average flux computation step (the predictor step) of Lax-Wendroff methods. The application of AD is similar for methods of any order and does not need positivity corrections during the predictor step. This contrasts with the approximate Lax-Wendroff procedure, which requires different finite difference formulas for different orders of the method and positivity corrections in the predictor step for fluxes that can only be computed on admissible states. The method is Jacobian-free and problem-independent, allowing direct application to any physical flux function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the order and positivity preservation of the method. Additionally, performance comparisons indicate that the wall-clock time of automatic differentiation is always on par with the approximate Lax-Wendroff method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a region in the complex plane enclosed by a deltoid curve inscribed in the unit circle, and define a family of polynomials $P_n$ that satisfy the same recurrence relation as the Faber polynomials for this region. We use this family of polynomials to give a constructive proof that $z^n$ is approximately a polynomial of degree $\sim\sqrt{n}$ within the deltoid region. Moreover, we show that $|P_n| \le 1$ in this deltoid region, and that, if $|z| = 1+\varepsilon$, then the magnitude $|P_n(z)|$ is at least $\frac{1}{3}(1+\sqrt{\varepsilon})^n$, for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We illustrate our polynomial approximation theory with an application to iterative linear algebra. In particular, we construct a higher-order momentum-based method that accelerates the power iteration for certain matrices with complex eigenvalues. We show how the method can be run dynamically when the two dominant eigenvalues are real and positive.</description>

      <title>High-order Computation of Floquet Multipliers and Subspaces using Multistep Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient computation of Floquet multipliers and subspaces is essential for analyzing limit cycle in dynamical systems and periodic steady state in Radio Frequency simulation. This problem is typically addressed by solving a periodic linear eigenvalue problem, which is discretized from the linear time-periodic system using one-step collocation methods. Collocation methods become costly for large-scale cases. Our alternative approach is to use multistep methods. The multistep method leads to a periodic polynomial eigenvalue problem (pPEP), and introduces additional parasitic periodic eigenvalues. We prove that as the stepsize decreases, the computed Floquet multipliers and their associated invariant subspace converge with higher order, while the parasitic periodic eigenvalues converge to zero geometrically and therefore Floquet multipliers are not affected by those parasitic ones. A memory-efficient algorithm pTOAR is designed to solve the large-scale pPEP. Its computational and memory costs are almost independent of the choice of multistep methods. Numerical results coincide with our convergence analysis, and also demonstrate the efficiency of pTOAR.</description>

      <title>Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</description>

      <title>Formula for Hermite multivariate interpolation and partial fraction decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new formula for the Hermite multivariate interpolation problem in the framework of the Chung--Yao approach. By using the respective univariate interpolation formula, we obtain a direct and explicit solution to the classical partial fraction decomposition problem for rational functions, including the real case.</description>

      <title>Guided Diffusion Sampling on Function Spaces with Applications to PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an unconditional, discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and inverse problems in the context of PDEs.

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact: extension to linear viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13818v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.</description>
