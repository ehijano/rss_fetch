      <title>Tighter Lower Bounds on Quantum Annealing Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive lower bounds on the time needed for a quantum annealer to prepare the ground state of a target Hamiltonian. These bounds do not depend on the annealing schedule and can take the local structure of the Hamiltonian into account. Consequently, the bounds are computable without knowledge of the annealer's dynamics and, in certain cases, scale with the size of the system. We discuss spin systems where the bounds are polynomially tighter than existing bounds, qualitatively capturing the scaling of the exact annealing times as a function of the number of spins.</description>

      <title>Noise resilience in adaptive and symmetric monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits offer great perspectives for exploring the interplay of quantum information and complex quantum dynamics. These systems could realize the extensively studied entanglement and purification phase transitions, as well as a rich variety of symmetry-protected and ordered non-equilibrium phases. The central question regarding such phases is whether they survive in real-world devices exhibiting unavoidable symmetry-breaking noise. We study the fate of the symmetry-protected absorbing state and charge-sharpening transitions in the presence of symmetry-breaking noise, and establish that the net effect of noise results in coherent and incoherent symmetry-breaking effects. The coherent contribution removes a sharp distinction between different phases and renders phase transitions to crossovers. Nevertheless, states far away from the original phase boundaries retain their essential character. In fact, corrective feedback in adaptive quantum circuits and postselected measurements in symmetric charge-conserving quantum circuits can suppress the effects of noise, thereby stabilizing the absorbing and charge-sharp phases, respectively. Despite the unavoidable noise in current quantum hardwares, our findings offer an optimistic outlook for observing symmetry-protected phases in currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Moreover, our work suggests a symmetry-based benchmarking method as an alternative for characterizing noise and evaluating average local gate fidelity.</description>

      <title>CountCrypt: Quantum Cryptography between QCMA and PP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a quantum oracle relative to which BQP = QCMA but quantum-computation-classical-communication (QCCC) key exchange, QCCC commitments, and two-round quantum key distribution exist. We also construct an oracle relative to which BQP = QMA, but quantum lightning (a stronger variant of quantum money) exists. This extends previous work by Kretschmer [Kretschmer, TQC22], which showed that there is a quantum oracle relative to which BQP = QMA but pseudorandom state generators (a quantum variant of pseudorandom generators) exist. We also show that QCCC key exchange, QCCC commitments, and two-round quantum key distribution can all be used to build one-way puzzles. One-way puzzles are a version of "quantum samplable" one-wayness and are an intermediate primitive between pseudorandom state generators and EFI pairs, the minimal quantum primitive. In particular, one-way puzzles cannot exist if BQP = PP. Our results together imply that aside from pseudorandom state generators, there is a large class of quantum cryptographic primitives which can exist even if BQP = QCMA, but are broken if BQP = PP. Furthermore, one-way puzzles are a minimal primitive for this class. We denote this class "CountCrypt".</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Core Fiber Platform for Classical and Entangled Two-Photon Absorption Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a toluene-filled fiber platform for two-photon absorption measurements. By confining both the light and molecular sample inside the 5 $\mu$m hollow core of the fiber, we increase the distance over which the nonlinear light-matter interaction occurs. With only a 7.3 nL excitation volume, we measure classical two-photon absorption (C2PA) at an average laser power as low as 1.75 nW, which is a 45-fold improvement over a conventional free-space technique. We use this platform to attempt to measure entangled two-photon absorption (E2PA), a process with a limited operating regime due to a crossover in dominating processes from E2PA to C2PA as photon flux is increased. Recently, several teams of researchers have reported that E2PA cross sections are much smaller than previously claimed. As a result, the process dominates at photon fluxes so low that it is extremely difficult or impossible to measure using conventional free-space techniques. In this report, we implement the first E2PA measurement using a waveguide. We see no evidence of E2PA, and we set an upper bound on the cross section consistent with these recent reports.</description>

      <title>Cooperative non-reciprocal emission and quantum sensing of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal propagation of energy and information is fundamental to a wide range of quantum technology applications. In this work, we explore the quantum many-body dynamics of a qubit ensemble coupled to a shared bath that mediates coherent and dissipative inter-qubit interactions with both symmetric and anti-symmetric components. We find that the interplay between anti-symmetric (symmetric) coherent and symmetric (anti-symmetric) dissipative interactions results in non-reciprocal couplings, which, in turn, generate a spatially asymmetric emission pattern. We demonstrate that this pattern arises from non-reciprocal interactions coupling different quantum many-body states within a specific excitation manifold. Focusing on solid-state baths, we show that their lack of time-reversal and inversion symmetry is a key ingredient for generating non-reciprocal dynamics in the qubit ensemble. With the plethora of quantum materials that exhibit this symmetry breaking at equilibrium, our approach paves the way for realizing cooperative non-reciprocal transport in qubit ensembles without requiring time-modulated external drives or complex engineering. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to a generic non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic bath as a concrete example, we demonstrate that our predictions can be tested in near-future experiments. As the spatial asymmetry in the relaxation dynamics of the qubit ensemble is a direct probe of symmetry breaking in the solid-state bath, our work also opens the door to developing model-agnostic quantum sensing schemes capable of detecting bath properties invisible to current state-of-the-art protocols, which operate solid-state defects as single-qubit sensors.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum computation using Ising anyons from a non-semisimple Topological Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological quantum computation using newly discovered non-semisimple analogs of topological quantum field theories in 2+1 dimensions. These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the $\nu = 5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>LUCI in the Surface Code with Dropouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, usage of detecting regions facilitated the discovery of new circuits for fault-tolerantly implementing the surface code. Building on these ideas, we present LUCI, a framework for constructing fault-tolerant circuits flexible enough to construct aperiodic and anisotropic circuits, making it a clear step towards quantum error correction beyond static codes. We show that LUCI can be used to adapt surface code circuits to lattices with imperfect qubit and coupler yield, a key challenge for fault-tolerant quantum computers using solid-state architectures. These circuits preserve spacelike distance for isolated broken couplers or isolated broken measure qubits in exchange for halving timelike distance, substantially reducing the penalty for dropout compared to the state of the art and creating opportunities in device architecture design. For qubit and coupler dropout rates of 1% and a patch diameter of 15, LUCI achieves an average spacelike distance of 13.1, compared to 9.1 for the best method in the literature. For a SI1000(0.001) circuit noise model, this translates to a 36x improvement in median logical error rate per round, a factor which increases with device performance. At these dropout and error rates, LUCI requires roughly 25% fewer physical qubits to reach algorithmically relevant one-in-a-trillion logical codeblock error rates.</description>

      <title>Recovering dark states by non-Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark states, which are incapable of absorbing and emitting light, have been widely applied in multiple disciplines of physics. However, the existence of dark states relies on certain strict constraints on the system. For instance, in the fundamental {\Lambda} system, a perturbation breaking the degeneracy between two energy levels may destroy the destructive interference and demolish the dark state. Here, we show that non-Hermiticity can be exploited as a constructive means to restore a dark state. By compensating for the undesired perturbations, non-Hermiticity produces unidirectional couplings such that the dark state remains decoupled from the rest of the system. Implementing this scheme in many-body systems, flat bands and edge states can be recovered by losses and gains. Further taking into account interactions, a range of novel quantum phases could arise in such non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we apply a procedure based on the quantum imaginary time evolution method to solve the unit-disk maximum independent set problem. Numerical simulations were performed for instances of 6, 8 and 10-qubits graphs. We have found that the failure probability of the procedure is relatively small and rapidly decreases with the number of shots. In addition, a theoretical upper bound for the failure probability of the procedure was obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable, reliable quantum light sources are essential for increasing quantum channel capacity and advancing quantum protocols based on photonic qubits. Although recent developments in solid-state quantum emitters have enabled the generation of single photons with high performance, the scalable integration of quantum devices onto practical optical platforms remains a challenging task. Here, we present a breakthrough in achieving a multiple, tunable array of quantum photonic devices. The selective integration of multiple quantum dot devices onto a V-groove fiber platform features scalability, tunability, high yield, and high single-photon coupling efficiency. Therefore, our fiber-integrated quantum platform realizes a scalable and reliable single-photon array within a compact fiber chip at telecom wavelengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to enable the sequential implementation of quantum information theoretic protocols in the continuous variable framework, we propose two schemes for resource reusability, resource-splitting protocol and unsharp homodyne measurements. We demonstrate the advantage offered by the first scheme in implementing sequential attempts at continuous variable teleportation when the protocol fails in the previous round. On the other hand, unsharp quadrature measurements are employed to implement the detection of entanglement between several pairs of parties. We exhibit that, under specific conditions, it is possible to witness the entanglement of a state an arbitrary number of times via a scheme that differs significantly from any protocol proposed for finite dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>High-precision pulse calibration of tunable couplers for high-fidelity two-qubit gates in superconducting quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For superconducting quantum processors, stable high-fidelity two-qubit operations depend on precise flux control of the tunable coupler. However, the pulse distortion poses a significant challenge to the control precision. Current calibration methods, which often rely on microwave crosstalk or additional readout resonators for coupler excitation and readout, tend to be cumbersome and inefficient, especially when couplers only have flux control. Here, we introduce and experimentally validate a novel pulse calibration scheme that exploits the strong coupling between qubits and couplers, eliminating the need for extra coupler readout and excitation. Our method directly measures the short-time and long-time step responses of the coupler flux pulse transient, enabling us to apply predistortion to subsequent signals using fast Fourier transformation and deconvolution. This approach not only simplifies the calibration process but also significantly improves the precision and stability of the flux control. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through the implementation of diabatic CZ and iSWAP gates with fidelities of $99.61\pm0.04\%$ and $99.82\pm0.02\%$, respectively, as well as a series of diabatic CPhase gates with high fidelities characterized by cross-entropy benchmarking. The consistency and robustness of our technique are further validated by the reduction in pulse distortion and phase error observed across multilayer CZ gates. These results underscore the potential of our calibration and predistortion method to enhance the performance of two-qubit gates in superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Computing via Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit knitting offers a promising path to the scalable execution of large quantum circuits by breaking them into smaller sub-circuits whose output is recombined through classical postprocessing. However, current techniques face excessive overhead due to a naive postprocessing method that neglects potential optimizations in the circuit structure. To overcome this, we introduce qTPU, a framework for scalable hybrid quantum-classical processing using tensor networks. By leveraging our hybrid quantum circuit contraction method, we represent circuit execution as the contraction of a hybrid tensor network (h-TN). The qTPU compiler automates efficient h-TN generation, optimizing the balance between estimated error and postprocessing overhead, while the qTPU runtime supports large-scale h-TN contraction using quantum and classical accelerators. Our evaluation shows orders-of-magnitude reductions in postprocessing overhead, a $10^4\times$ speedup in postprocessing, and a 20.7$\times$ reduction in overall runtime compared to the state-of-the-art Qiskit-Addon-Cutting (QAC).</description>

      <title>Simulating and investigating various dynamic aspects of $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model, modified from the Jaynes-Cummings model, is proposed and its various dynamic aspects are investigated theoretically. In this model, the formation and breaking processes of hydrogen bond are accompanied by the creation and annihilation of the thermal phonon of the medium. A number of simplifying assumptions about the dynamics of the molecules involved are used. Rotating wave approximation is applied under consideration of the strong-coupling condition. Dissipative dynamics under the Markovian approximation is obtained through solving the quantum master equation - Lindbladian. The probabilities of reaction channels involving hydrogen bond depending on the parameters of the external environment, are obtained. Differences between unitary and dissipative evolutions are disciussed. Consideration is given to the effect of all kinds of potential interactions and dissipations on evolution. Consideration is also given to the reverse processes (inflows) of dissipations. The results show that the magnitude changes of the interactions and dissipations have slight effect on the formation of hydrogen bond, but the variation of the reverse processes of dissipations significantly affect the formation of hydrogen bond. According to the findings, the dynamics of $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model can be controlled by selectively choosing system parameters. The results will be used as a basis to extend the research to more complex chemical and biological model in the future.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Unitary Coupled Cluster Wave Functions on Quantum Hardware: Error Bound and Resource-Efficient Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the projective quantum eigensolver (PQE) approach to optimizing unitary coupled cluster wave functions on quantum hardware, as introduced in arXiv:2102.00345. The projective quantum eigensolver is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm which, by optimizing a unitary coupled cluster wave function, aims at computing the ground state of many-body systems. Instead of trying to minimize the energy of the system like in the variational quantum eigensolver, PQE uses projections of the Schr\"odinger equation to efficiently bring the trial state closer to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we provide a mathematical study of the algorithm, which allows us to obtain a number of interesting results. We first show that one can derive a bound relating off-diagonal coefficients (residues) of the Hamiltonian to the error of the algorithm. This bound not only gives a formal motivation to the projective approach to optimizing unitary coupled cluster wavefunctions, but it also allows us to formulate a well-informed convergence criterion for residue-based optimizers. We then introduce a mathematical study of the classical optimization itself, and show that, using our results, one can derive a residue-based optimizer for which we present numerical evidence of superiority over both the optimization introduced in arXiv:2102.00345 and VQE optimized using the Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (BFGS) method.</description>

      <title>Network Nonlocality Without Entanglement Of All Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement and nonlocality are two important nonclassical features of quantum correlations. Recently the study of quantum correlations in networks has undergone remarkable progress owing to technological development towards scalable quantum networks. However, compared to standard Bell scenario, manifestation of the interplay between these two aspects has received less attention in network scenarios featuring independent sources. In this work we have analyzed the relation between entanglement content of the sources and detectable non n-locality in two distinct network topologies(linear and star). We have studied the extremal violations of n-local inequalities(compatible with linear and star network) for any fixed amount of entanglement(in terms of concurrence) of the independent sources. It is observed that each of the sources must be entangled for detecting non n-locality in linear network. However, the same is not true for star n-local network. Present analysis is revealing that entanglement of all the independent sources is not a necessity for generation of non n-local correlations in star topology. Characterization of sources in terms of minimum entanglement requirement for any fixed violation amount of the n-local inequalities is also provided. Interestingly, detection of non n-locality is ensured in the network if product of concurrence of all the sources involved exceeds 1/2. .</description>

      <title>Robust Noise Suppression and Quantum Sensing by Continuous Phased Dynamical Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate experimentally continuous phased dynamical decoupling (CPDD), where we apply a continuous field with discrete phase changes for quantum sensing and robust compensation of environmental and amplitude noise. CPDD does not use short pulses, making it particularly suitable for experiments with limited driving power or nuclear magnetic resonance at high magnetic fields. It requires control of the timing of the phase changes, offering much greater precision than the Rabi frequency control needed in standard continuous sensing schemes. We successfully apply our method to nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance and combine it with quantum heterodyne detection, achieving $\mu$Hz uncertainty in the estimated signal frequency for a 120 s measurement. Our work expands significantly the applicability of dynamical decoupling and opens the door for a wide range of experiments, e.g., in Nitrogen-Vacancy centers, trapped ions or trapped atoms.</description>

      <title>Elastic scattering of electron by a Yukawa potential in non-commutative spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the elastic scattering of an electron by a Yukawa potential within the framework of non-commutative (NC) geometry. We first derive the NC correction to the Yukawa potential at leading order in the NC parameter, resulting in a modified potential resembling a screened Kratzer potential. This potential reduces to the standard Kratzer form when considering the NC correction to the Coulomb potential. Subsequently, we calculate the NC correction to the electron scattering amplitude using the first-order Born approximation. We then analyze the effects of NC geometry on both the differential and total cross sections for elastic scattering. Our results indicate that non-commutativity enhances the differential cross section at small scattering angles and naturally gives rise to a Kratzer-like potential, reflecting the quantum nature of spacetime. Additionally, we establish a direct relationship between the system's energy level and the bound on the NC parameter. Specifically, for an ultra-relativistic incident electron scattering by a heavy molecule, we derive a new lower bound on $\Theta$ of the order of $10^{-28}\,\text{m}$.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entangling power by von Neumann entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the entanglement generation of a multipartite unitary operation is a key problem in quantum information processing. We introduce the definition of multipartite entangling, assisted entangling, and disentangling power, which is a natural generalization of the bipartite ones. We show that they are assumed at a specified quantum state. We analytically derive the entangling power of Schmidt-rank-two multi-qubit unitary operations by the minimal convex sum of modulo-one complex numbers. Besides we show the necessary and sufficient condition that the assisted entangling power of Schmidt-rank-two unitary operations reaches the maximum. We further investigate the widely-used multi-qubit gates, for example, the entangling and assisted entangling power of the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate is one ebit. The entangling power of the three-qubit Fredkin gate is two ebits, and that of the four-qubit Fredkin gate is in two to $\log_25$ ebits.</description>

      <title>Improved Time-independent Hamiltonian Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a simple method for simulating time-independent Hamiltonian $H$ that could be decomposed as $H = \sum_{i=1}^m H_i$ where each $H_i$ can be efficiently simulated. Approaches relying on product formula generally work by splitting the evolution time into segments, and approximate the evolution in each segment by the evolution of composing Hamiltonian $H_i$. This key step incur a constraint, that prohibits a (poly)logarithmic scaling on approximation error. We employ the recently introduced quantum singular value transformation framework to utilize the ability to simulate $H_i$ in an alternative way, which then allows us to construct and simulate the main Hamiltonian $H$ with polylogarithmical scaling on the inverse of desired error, which is a major improvement with respect to product formula approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhancing entanglement in nano-mechanical oscillators via hybrid optomechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore and compare four criteria for continuous-variable entanglement, which serve as sufficient conditions for determining the separability of Gaussian two-mode states. Our system comprises two nano-mechanical resonators coupled to a hybrid doubly resonant optomechanical cavity system integrated with a non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier. The entanglement between the mechanical oscillators is primarily driven by non-classical state transitions of injected photons from the squeezed vacuum reservoir and intracavity squeezed radiation induced by radiation pressure in which the system operates in the weak coupling regime within good cavity limit. Our findings indicate that while the applied inseparability criteria show similar entanglement patterns within specific parameter ranges, the degree of entanglement varies depending on the chosen criteria. Additionally, the combined effects of injected squeezing and the parametric amplifier significantly enhance the entanglement when optimal parameters are selected. We also observe that the strength of the entanglement is mainly influenced by optomechanical cooperativity and thermal noise from the mechanical baths. The entanglement levels can be controlled by carefully adjusting these parameters, suggesting potential applications in quantum metrology and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Preparing Spin Squeezed States via Adaptive Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel strategy employing an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) for iterative optimization of control sequences to generate quantum nonclassical states. Its efficacy is demonstrated by preparing spin-squeezed states in an open collective spin model governed by a linear control field. Inspired by Darwinian evolution, the algorithm iteratively refines control sequences using crossover, mutation, and elimination strategies, starting from a coherent spin state within a dissipative and dephasing environment. An adaptive parameter adjustment mechanism further enhances optimization. Our approach, compared to constant control schemes, yields a variety of control sequences capable of maintaining squeezing for the collective spin model. Furthermore, the proposed strategy exhibits increased effectiveness in diverse systems, while reservoir thermal excitations are shown to negatively impact control outcomes. We discuss feasible experimental implementations and potential extensions to alternative quantum systems, and the adaptability of the GA module. This research establishes the foundation for utilizing GA-like strategies in controlling quantum systems and achieving desired nonclassical states.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Environment of a Superconducting Qubit with an Artificial Giant Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum computing, precise control of system-environment coupling is essential for high-fidelity gates, measurements, and networking. We present an architecture that employs an artificial giant atom from waveguide quantum electrodynamics to tailor the interaction between a superconducting qubit and its environment. This frequency-tunable giant atom exhibits both frequency and power selectivity for photons: when resonant with the qubit, it reflects single photons emitted from the qubit while remaining transparent to strong microwave signals for readout and control. This approach surpasses the Purcell limit and significantly extends the qubit's lifetime by ten times while maintaining the readout speed, thereby improving both gate operations and readout. Our architecture holds promise for bridging circuit and waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems in quantum technology applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that bipartite bound entangled states make possible violations of correlation inequalities in the prepare-and-measure scenario. These inequalities are satisfied by all classical models as well as by all quantum models that do not feature entanglement. In contrast to the known Bell inequality violations from bound entangled states, we find that the violations in the prepare-and-measure scenario are sizeable and significantly noise-tolerant. Furthermore, we evidence that significantly stronger quantum correlations are made possible by considering bound entanglement with a larger dimension.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum superposition of topological defects in a trapped ion quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects are discontinuities of a system protected by global properties, with wide applications in mathematics and physics. While previous experimental studies mostly focused on their classical properties, it has been predicted that topological defects can exhibit quantum superposition. Despite the fundamental interest and potential applications in understanding symmetry-breaking dynamics of quantum phase transitions, its experimental realization still remains a challenge. Here, we report the observation of quantum superposition of topological defects in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. By engineering long-range spin-spin interactions, we observe a spin kink splitting into a superposition of kinks at different positions, creating a ``Schrodinger kink'' that manifests non-locality and quantum interference. Furthermore, by preparing superposition states of neighboring kinks with different phases, we observe the propagation of the wave packet in different directions, thus unambiguously verifying the quantum coherence in the superposition states. Our work provides useful tools for non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum Kibble-Zurek physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum game theory has emerged as a promising candidate to further the understanding of quantum correlations. Motivated by this, it is demonstrated that pure strategy Nash equilibria can be utilised as a mechanism to witness and determine quantum correlation. By combining quantum theory with Bayesian game theory, a constant-sum game is designed in which the players are competing against each other, and crucially gain at the other player's expense. Subsequently, it is found that mixed strategy Nash equilibria are only necessary when considering quantum correlation for the designed game. This reveals that a Bayesian game-theoretic framework yields a sufficient condition in which to detect quantum effects.</description>

Abstract: We develop a hybrid classical-quantum method for solving the Lorenz system. We use the forward Euler method to discretize the system in time, transforming it into a system of equations. This set of equations is solved using the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm. We present numerical results comparing the hybrid method with the classical approach for solving the Lorenz system. The simulation results demonstrate that the VQLS method can effectively compute solutions comparable to classical methods. The method is easily extended to solving similar nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <title>Kerr enhanced optomechanical cooling in the unresolved sideband regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical backaction cooling has been demonstrated to be a successful method for achieving the motional quantum ground state of a mechanical oscillator in the resolved sideband regime, where the mechanical frequency is significantly larger than the cavity decay rate. Nevertheless, as mechanical systems increase in size, their frequencies naturally decrease, thus bringing them into the unresolved sideband regime, where the effectiveness of the sideband cooling approach decreases. Here, we will demonstrate, however, that this cooling technique in the unresolved sideband regime can be significantly enhanced by utilizing a nonlinear cavity as shown in the experimental work of Zoepfl et. al. (PRL, 2023). The above arises due to the increased asymmetry between the cooling and heating processes, thereby improving the cooling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum information collapse-and-revival in a strongly-interacting Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions of isolated quantum many-body systems typically scramble local information into the entire system and make it unrecoverable. Ergodicity-breaking systems possess the potential to exhibit fundamentally different information scrambling dynamics beyond this paradigm. For many-body localized systems with strong ergodicity breaking, local transport vanishes and information scrambles logarithmically slowly. Whereas in Rydberg atom arrays, local qubit flips induce dynamical retardation on surrounding qubits through the Rydberg blockade effect, giving rise to quantum many-body scars that weakly break ergodicity, and resulting in the predicted unconventional quantum information spreading behaviours. Here, we present the first measurements of out-of-time-ordered correlators and Holevo information in a Rydberg atom array, enabling us to precisely track quantum information scrambling and transport dynamics. By leveraging these tools, we observe a novel spatio-temporal collapse-and-revival behaviour of quantum information, which differs from both typical chaotic and many-body localized systems. Our experiment sheds light on the unique information dynamics in many-body systems with kinetic constraints, and demonstrates an effective digital-analogue approach to coherently reverse time evolution and steer information propagation in near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A Lieb-Robinson bound for open quantum systems with memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general class of spatially local non-Markovian open quantum lattice models, with a bosonic environment that is approximated as Gaussian. Under the assumption of a finite environment memory time, formalized as a finite total variation of the memory kernel, we show that these models satisfy a Lieb-Robinson bound. Our work generalizes Lieb Robinson bounds for open quantum systems, which have previously only been established in the Markovian limit. Using these bounds, we then show that these non-Markovian models can be well approximated by a larger Markovian model, which contains the system spins together with only a finite number of environment modes. In particular, we establish that as a consequence of our Lieb-Robinson bounds, the number of environment modes per system site needed to accurately capture local observables is independent of the size of the system.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometric phase (GP) acquired by two-mode mixed squeezed-coherent states (SCSs) during unitary cyclic evolution, focusing on the influence of squeezing parameters and classical weight. We analyze the GP for three distinct mixed states characterized by different configurations of the SCSs. Our results reveal that increasing the squeezing parameters of individual modes compresses the GP contours in different patterns: linearly, hyperbolically, and elliptically, depending on the mixed-state configuration. This behavior highlights the precision enhancement in squeezed states through uncertainty adjustment, aligning with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Predicting adaptively chosen observables in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated that $\mathcal{O}(\log M)$ measurements suffice to predict $M$ properties of arbitrarily large quantum many-body systems. However, these remarkable findings assume that the properties to be predicted are chosen independently of the data. This assumption can be violated in practice, where scientists adaptively select properties after looking at previous predictions. This work investigates the adaptive setting for three classes of observables: local, Pauli, and bounded-Frobenius-norm observables. We prove that $\Omega(\sqrt{M})$ samples of an arbitrarily large unknown quantum state are necessary to predict expectation values of $M$ adaptively chosen local and Pauli observables. We also present computationally-efficient algorithms that achieve this information-theoretic lower bound. In contrast, for bounded-Frobenius-norm observables, we devise an algorithm requiring only $\mathcal{O}(\log M)$ samples, independent of system size. Our results highlight the potential pitfalls of adaptivity in analyzing data from quantum experiments and provide new algorithmic tools to safeguard against erroneous predictions in quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Energy conservation in quantum optical high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of energy conservation arguments is ubiquitous in understanding the process of high harmonic generation, yet a complete quantum optical description of photon exchange remained elusive. Here, we solve this gap in description by introducing the energy conserving subspace in high harmonic generation in which many photons of the driving field are absorbed to generate a single photon of higher energy. The presented solution to energy conservation in quantum optical high harmonic generation naturally results in highly entangled states of light with non-classical properties in their marginals. This further allows to explain recent experimental results for quantum state engineering, for which we provide analytical bounds on the fidelity with a high photon number optical cat state.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and Sum-of-Squares Certificates for Qudit Hamiltonians Over Maximally Entangles States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Maximal Entanglement problem, a 2-local qudit Hamiltonian that we view as a quantum generalization of Unique Games and which naturally encodes the frustration present in entanglement over multiple systems. We prove monogamy of entanglement bounds by certifying the ground state energy of the Maximal Entanglement problem in terms of the maximum matching of the underlying interaction graph via low-degree sum-of-squares proofs. Algorithmically, while a random assignment achieves energy of at least $1/d^2$ times the ground state energy, we show that a simple matching-based algorithm outputs a state with energy at least $1/d$ of the ground state energy for general graphs and at least $1/d + \Theta(1/D)$ for graphs with bounded degree, $D$. Moreover, we show that this state has energy at least $1/2$ of the ground state energy on $D$-regular graphs with degree, $D \leq 5$, for any local dimension, $d$.</description>

      <title>Does quantum lattice sieving require quantum RAM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the requirement for quantum random access memory (QRAM) in quantum lattice sieving, a fundamental algorithm for lattice-based cryptanalysis.
  First, we obtain a lower bound on the cost of quantum lattice sieving with a bounded size QRAM. We do so in a new query model encompassing a wide range of lattice sieving algorithms similar to those in the classical sieving lower bound by Kirshanova and Laarhoven [CRYPTO 21]. This implies that, under reasonable assumptions, quantum speedups in lattice sieving require the use of QRAM. In particular, no quantum speedup is possible without QRAM.
  Second, we investigate the trade-off between the size of QRAM and the quantum speedup. We obtain a new interpolation between classical and quantum lattice sieving. Moreover, we show that further improvements require a novel way to use the QRAM by proving the optimality of some subroutines. An important caveat is that this trade-off requires a strong assumption on the efficient replacement of QRAM data, indicating that even speedups with a small QRAM are already challenging.
  Finally, we provide a circuit for quantum lattice sieving without using QRAM. Our circuit has a better depth complexity than the best classical algorithms but requires an exponential amount of qubits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantum speedup for lattice sieving without QRAM in the standard quantum circuit model. We explain why this circuit does not contradict our lower bound, which considers the query complexity.</description>

      <title>Reservoir-engineered spin squeezing in quantum hybrid solid-state platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin squeezing, a form of many-body entanglement, is a crucial resource in quantum metrology and information processing. While experimentally viable protocols for generating stable spin squeezing have been proposed in quantum-optical platforms using atomic ensembles, there is growing interest in quantum hybrid solid-state systems as alternative platforms for exploring many-body quantum phenomena. In this work, we propose a scheme to generate long-lived spin squeezing in an ensemble of solid-state qubits interacting with electromagnetic noise emitted by a squeezed solid-state bath. We identify the conditions under which quantum correlations within the bath can be transferred to the qubit array, effectively driving the qubits into an entangled state, regardless of their initial configuration. To assess the experimental feasibility of our approach, we investigate the dynamics of an array of solid-state spin defects coupled to a common ferromagnetic bath, which is driven into a non-equilibrium squeezed state through its interaction with a surface acoustic wave mode. Our results demonstrate that the ensemble can exhibit steady-state spin squeezing under suitable conditions, paving the way for the generation of steady-state many-body entanglement in ensembles of solid-state spin defects.</description>

      <title>Trace-Distance based End-to-End Entanglement Fidelity with Information Preservation in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks hold the potential to revolutionize a variety of fields by surpassing the capabilities of their classical counterparts. Many of these applications necessitate the sharing of high-fidelity entangled pairs among communicating parties. However, the inherent nature of entanglement leads to an exponential decrease in fidelity as the distance between quantum nodes increases. This phenomenon makes it challenging to generate high-fidelity entangled pairs and preserve information in quantum networks. To tackle this problem, we utilized two strategies to ensure high-fidelity entangled pairs and information preservation within a quantum network. First, we use closeness centrality as a metric to identify the closest nodes in the network. Second, we introduced the trace-distance based path purification (TDPP) algorithm, specifically designed to enable information preservation and path purification entanglement routing. This algorithm identifies the shortest path within quantum networks using closeness centrality and integrates trace-distance computations for distinguishing quantum states and maintaining end-to-end (E2E) entanglement fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves network throughput and E2E fidelity while preserving information compared to existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the integration of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) into Hybrid Quantum-HPC systems for solving the Max-Cut problem, comparing its performance with classical algorithms like brute-force search and greedy heuristics. We develop a theoretical model to analyze the time complexity, scalability, and communication overhead in hybrid systems. Using simulations, we evaluate QAOA's performance on small-scale Max-Cut instances, benchmarking its runtime, solution accuracy, and resource utilization. The study also investigates the scalability of QAOA with increasing problem size, offering insights into its potential advantages over classical methods for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems, with implications for future Quantum computing applications in HPC environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental platform for linear-optical quantum information processing. Our setup utilizes multiphoton generation using a high-quality single-photon source, which is demultiplexed across multiple spatial channels, a custom-designed, programmable, low-loss photonic chip, and paired with high-efficiency single-photon detectors. We demonstrate the platform's capability in producing heralded arbitrary two-qubit dual-rail encoded states, a crucial building block for large-scale photonic quantum computers. The programmable chip was fully characterized through a calibration process that allowed us to create a numerical model accounting for fabrication imperfections and measurement errors. As a result, using on-chip quantum state tomography (QST), we achieved high-fidelity quantum state preparation, with a fidelity of 98.5\% specifically for the Bell state.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Finite Temperature Tensor Network with Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the combination of tensor network methods and the stabilizer formalism as a very effective framework for simulating quantum many-body systems, encompassing areas from ground state to time evolution simulations. In these approaches, the entanglement associated with stabilizers is transferred to Clifford circuits, which can be efficiently managed due to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Consequently, only the non-stabilizerness entanglement needs to be handled, thereby reducing the computational resources required for accurate simulations of quantum many-body systems in tensor network related methods. In this work, we adapt this paradigm for finite temperature simulations in the framework of Time-Dependent Variational Principle, in which imaginary time evolution is performed using the purification scheme. Our numerical results on the one-dimensional Heisenberg model and the two-dimensional $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model demonstrate that Clifford circuits can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of finite temperature simulations for quantum many-body systems. This improvement not only provides a useful tool for calculating finite temperature properties of quantum many-body systems, but also paves the way for further advancements in boosting the finite temperature tensor network calculations with Clifford circuits and other quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Search for New Particles with Flying Quantum Sensors in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in space science and technologies offer exciting prospects for investigating novel research that is unattainable within terrestrial laboratories. Here we propose the implementation of space-based quantum sensing to explore ultralight new particles beyond the standard model. The central idea involves probing long-range interactions between spin ensembles of space quantum sensors and the particles residing within Earth, mediated by ultralight particles. We show that such interactions can be substantially enhanced in space platforms and thus increase the search sensitivity. In contrast to their terrestrial counterparts, space-based quantum searches exhibit remarkable velocity enhancements, approaching the first cosmic speed, and thus enables the exploration of unexplored parameter space concerning ultralight new particles. Furthermore, the substantial abundance of electrons and nucleons within Earth plays a crucial role in extending the scope of our mission. Our projected search sensitivity can surpass the sensitivities of both terrestrial experiments and proposals by up to approximately 7 orders of magnitude. We also briefly discuss other space mission, including ``space-ground integrated" network of quantum sensors for dark matter searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully revealing the mathmatical structure of quantum contextuality is a significant task, while some known contextuality theories are only applicable for rank-1 projectors. That is because they adopt the observable-based definitions. This paper analyses the challenges faced by some known contextuality theories, and establishes an event-based contextuality theory with partial Boolean algebra to overcome them. The theory can handle the scenarios composed of general projectors and observables, and provides a unified mathematical structure to investigate the hierarchy of quantum contextuality. It also introduces a tool to extend some known results from rank-1 cases to general cases. For example, we get a Kochen-Specker set with 12 projectors from the Cabello-Estebaranz-Garcia set with 18 vectors.</description>

      <title>A memory and gate efficient algorithm for unitary mixed Schur sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize the task of unitary Schur sampling -- an extension of weak Schur sampling -- which is the process of measuring the Young label and the unitary group register of an input $m$ qudit state. Intuitively, this task is equivalent to applying the Schur transform, projecting onto the isotypic subspaces of the unitary and symmetric groups indexed by the Young labels, and discarding of the permutation register. As such unitary Schur sampling is the natural task in processes such as quantum state tomography or spectrum estimation. We generalize this task to unitary mixed Schur sampling to account for the recently introduced mixed Schur-Weyl transform. We provide a streaming algorithm which achieves an exponential reduction in the memory complexity and a polynomial reduction in the gate complexity over na\"ive algorithms for the task of unitary (mixed) Schur sampling. Further, we show that if the input state has limited rank, the gate and memory complexities of our streaming algorithm as well as the algorithms for the full Schur and mixed Schur transforms are further reduced. Our work generalizes and improves on the results in arXiv2309.11947.</description>

      <title>Learning junta distributions and quantum junta states, and QAC$^0$ circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problems of learning junta distributions, their quantum counter-part, quantum junta states, and QAC$^0$ circuits, which we show to be juntas.
  $\mathbf{Junta\ distributions.\ }$A probability distribution $p:\{-1,1\}^n\to \mathbb [0,1]$ is a $k$-junta if it only depends on $k$ variables. We show that they can be learned with to error $\varepsilon$ in total variation distance from $O(2^k\log(n)/\varepsilon^2)$ samples, which quadratically improves the upper bound of Aliakbarpour et al. (COLT'16) and matches their lower bound in every parameter.
  $\mathbf{Junta\ states.\ }$We initiate the study of $n$-qubit states that are $k$-juntas, those that are the tensor product of a $k$-qubit state and an $(n-k)$-qubit maximally mixed state. We show that these states can be learned with error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance with $O(12^{k}\log(n)/\varepsilon^2)$ single copies. We also prove a lower bound of $\Omega((4^k+\log (n))/\varepsilon^2)$ copies. Along the way, we give a new proof of the optimal performance of Classical Shadows based on Pauli analysis.
  $\mathbf{QAC^0\ circuits.\ }$Nadimpalli et al. (STOC'24) recently showed that the Pauli spectrum of QAC$^0$ circuits (with not too many auxiliary qubits) is concentrated on low-degree. We remark that they showed something stronger, namely that the Choi states of those circuits are close to be juntas. As a consequence, we show that $n$-qubit QAC$^0$ circuits with size $s$, depth $d$ and $a$ auxiliary qubits can be learned from $2^{O(\log(s^22^a)^d)}\log (n)$ copies of the Choi state, improving the $n^{O(\log(s^22^a)^d)}$ by Nadimpalli et al. In addition, we use this remark to improve on the lower bounds against QAC$^0$ circuits to compute the address function.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Measure : Genuine to Absolutely Maximally Entangled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, crucial to advancements in quantum information processing and quantum computation. Within this field, Genuinely Multipartite Entanglement (GME), being entangled in all bipartitions, and Absolutely Maximally Entanglement (AME), maximally entangled in all bipartitions, represent two significant types of entanglement with diverse applications. In this work, we introduce a new measure called the GME-AME multipartite entanglement measure, with a non-zero value representing the GME states and the maximum value is reached only by the AME states. The measure is applied to study the multipartite entanglement of four partite systems using the operator to state mapping, and the four partite permutation qutrit states are classified according to the measure. With various examples, we show that our measure is robust in classifying the four partite entangled states.</description>

      <title>A new general quantum state verification protocol by the classical shadow method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of verifying if a quantum device produces a specific state is ubiquitous in many applications of modern quantum technologies. In the conventional framework of quantum state verification, we need to design an optimal or efficient protocol for each type of state elaborately. In a recent paper arXiv:2404.07281v1 [quant-ph], Hsin-Yuan Huang et al. propose a new distinct protocol utilizing the classical shadow, called the shadow overlap protocol, which has the potential for efficiently verifying many types of state in one time. In this paper, we reformulate this new protocol by the terminologies of hypothesis testing, on which the conventional framework is also based, to explore the similarities and differences between them. Then, we propose a new protocol which combines the ideas of the conventional framework and the shadow overlap protocol. Our protocol strengthens the ability of the shadow overlap protocol and overcomes some shortages of the latter, like having a better sample complexity and dealing with the states with special structures more naturally. Finally, we apply our new protocol to the GHZ state and the stabilizer state to illustrate its capacities.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous cooling of qubits via a quantum absorption refrigerator and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a quantum thermal device that can simultaneously and dynamically cool multiple target qubits. Using a setup with three bosonic heat baths, we propose an engineering of interaction Hamiltonian using operators on different subspaces of the full Hilbert space of the system labelled by different magnetizations. We demonstrate, using the local as well as global quantum master equations, that a set of target qubits can be cooled simultaneously using these interaction Hamiltonians, while equal cooling of all target qubits is possible only when the local quantum master equation is used. However, the amount of cooling obtained from different magnetization subspaces, as quantified by a distance-based measure of qubit-local steady-state temperatures, may vary. We also investigate cooling of a set of target qubits when the interaction Hamiltonian has different magnetization components, and when the design of the quantum thermal device involves two heat baths instead of three. Further, we demonstrate, using local quantum master equation, that during providing cooling to the target qubits, the designed device operates only as a quantum absorption refrigerator. In contrast, use of the global quantum master equation indicates cooling of the target qubits even when the device works outside the operation regime of a quantum absorption refrigerator. We also extend the design to a star network of qubits interacting via Heisenberg interaction among each other, kept in contact with either three, or two heat baths, and discuss cooling of a set of target qubits using this device.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of counter-intuitive features of photonic bunching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic bunching is a term used to describe the well-known tendency of bosons to bunch together, and which differentiates their behaviour from that of fermions or classical particles. However, in some situations perfectly indistinguishable bosons may counter-intuitively bunch less than classical, distinguishable particles. Here we report two such counter-intuitive multiphoton bunching effects observed with three photons in a three-mode balanced photonic Fourier interferometer. In this setting, we show indistinguishable photons actually minimize the probability of bunching. We also show that any non-trivial value of the three-photon collective photonic phase leads to a decreased probability of all photons ending up in the same mode, even as we increase pairwise indistinguishability. Our experiments feature engineering of partial indistinguishability scenarios using both the time and the polarization photonic degrees of freedom, and a polarization-transparent 8-mode tunable interferometer with a quantum-dot source of single photons. Besides the foundational understanding, the observation of these counter-intuitive phenomena open news perspective in devising more efficient ways of routing photons for advantage in metrology and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Deterministic entanglement concentration assisted by generalized XZ basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol for concentrating bipartite entanglement over a qubit-qudit system from arbitrary number of qubit-qudit states via a truncation of the Hilbert space corresponding to the subsystem containing the qubits to a space that hosts a single qubit. We achieve this truncation via a multi-qubit measurement in the generalized XZ basis, and show that the protocol is effectively deterministic. We also design a repetitive two-qubit measurement protocol, where the measurements on the qubit-parts is performed taking two qubit-qudit system at a time, and establish its equivalence with the protocol involving the multi-qubit measurement. We show that a concentration of entanglement is possible in each round of two-qubit measurements in the latter scheme, and derive lower and upper bounds of the entanglement concentrated after a given number of rounds of measurements, where the entanglement of the initial qubit-qudit systems are not-necessarily equal. We apply the repetitive two-qubit measurement protocol to concentrate entanglement using arbitrary two-qubit states with unequal entanglement, and discuss the entanglement properties of the multi-qubit state created in this process. We also show that the protocol can be used to create generalized GHZ states on arbitrary number of qubits, which highlights the possibility of creating maximally entangled qubit pairs via qubit-local projection measurements.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Control and Readout Integrated Circuits for Solid-State Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of quantum computing, solid-state quantum systems, particularly superconducting ones, have made remarkable advancements over the past two decades. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing for next-generation applications necessitates the integration of several million qubits, which presents significant challenges in terms of interconnection complexity and latency that are currently unsolvable with state-of-the-art room-temperature control and readout electronics. Recently, cryogenic integrated circuits (ICs), including CMOS radio-frequency ICs and rapid-single-flux-quantum-logic ICs, have emerged as potential alternatives to room-temperature electronics. Unlike their room-temperature counterparts, these ICs are deployed within cryostats to enhance scalability by reducing the number and length of transmission lines. Additionally, operating at cryogenic temperatures can suppress electronic noise and improve qubit control fidelity. However, for CMOS ICs specifically, circuit design uncertainties arise due to a lack of reliable models for cryogenic field effect transistors as well as issues related to severe fickle noises and power dissipation at cryogenic temperatures. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on both types of cryogenic control and readout ICs but primarily focuses on the more mature CMOS technology. The discussion encompasses principles underlying control and readout techniques employed in cryogenic CMOS ICs along with their architectural designs; characterization and modeling approaches for field effect transistors under cryogenic conditions; as well as fundamental concepts pertaining to rapid single flux quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Hidden exceptional point, localization-delocalization phase transition in Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), a unique feature of non-Hermitian systems, represent degeneracies in non-Hermitian operators that likely do not occur in Hermitian systems. Nevertheless, unlike its fermionic counterpart, a Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model supports a non-Hermitian core matrix, involving a quantum phase transition (QPT) when an exceptional point appears. In this study, we examine QPTs by mapping the Hamiltonian onto a set of equivalent single-particle systems using a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like pairing basis. We demonstrate the connection between the hidden EP and the localization-delocalization transition in the equivalent systems. The result is applicable to a Dicke model, which allows the experimental detection of the transition based on the measurement of the average number of photons for the quench dynamics stating from the empty state. Numerical simulations of the time evolution reveal a clear transition point at the EP.</description>

      <title>Signed R\'enyi Entropy and Quantum Second Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We modify the R\'enyi (1961) axioms for entropy to apply to negative (``signed") measures as arise, for example, in phase-space representations of quantum mechanics. We obtain two new measures of (lack of) information about a system -- which we propose as signed analogs to classical Shannon entropy and classical R\'enyi entropy, respectively. We show that signed R\'enyi entropy witnesses non-classicality of a system. Specifically, a measure has at least one negative component if and only if signed R\'enyi $\alpha$-entropy is negative for some $\alpha &gt; 1$. The corresponding non-classicality test does not work with signed Shannon entropy. We next show that signed R\'enyi $2k$-entropy, when $k$ is a positive integer, is Schur-concave. (An example shows that signed Shannon entropy is not Schur-concave.) We then establish an abstract quantum H-theorem for signed measures. We prove that signed R\'enyi $2k$-entropy is non-decreasing under classical (``decohering") evolution of a signed measure, where the latter could be a Wigner function or other phase-space representation of a quantum system. (An example shows that signed Shannon entropy may be non-monotonic.) We also provide a characterization of the Second Law for signed R\'enyi $2$-entropy in terms of what we call eventual classicalization of evolution of a system. We conclude with an argument that signed R\'enyi $2$-entropy of the Wigner function is constant under Moyal bracket evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative for the direct simulation of quantum systems with the potential to explore chemical problems beyond the capabilities of classical methods. However, current quantum algorithms are constrained by hardware limitations and the increased number of measurements required to achieve chemical accuracy. To address the measurement challenge, techniques for grouping commuting and anti-commuting terms, driven by heuristics, have been developed to reduce the number of measurements needed in quantum algorithms on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose a probabilistic framework using GFlowNets to group fully (FC) or qubit-wise commuting (QWC) terms within a given Hamiltonian. The significance of this approach is demonstrated by the reduced number of measurements for the found groupings; 51% and 67% reduction factors respectively for FC and QWC partitionings with respect to greedy coloring algorithms, highlighting the potential of GFlowNets for future applications in the measurement problem. Furthermore, the flexibility of our algorithm extends its applicability to other resource optimization problems in Hamiltonian simulation, such as circuit design.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum Propagators for Driven-Dissipative Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing the dynamics of strong-laser driven open quantum systems is a very challenging task that requires the solution of highly involved equations of motion. While machine learning techniques are being applied with some success to simulate the time evolution of individual quantum states, their use to approximate time-dependent operators (that can evolve various states) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop driven neural quantum propagators (NQP), a universal neural network framework that solves driven-dissipative quantum dynamics by approximating propagators rather than wavefunctions or density matrices. NQP can handle arbitrary initial quantum states, adapt to various external fields, and simulate long-time dynamics, even when trained on far shorter time windows. Furthermore, by appropriately configuring the external fields, our trained NQP can be transferred to systems governed by different Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by studying the spin-boson and the three-state transition Gamma models.</description>

      <title>Projective Quantum Eigensolver with Generalized Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determination of molecular energetics and properties is one of the core challenges in the near-term quantum computing. To this end, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are preferred for Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) architectures. The Projective Quantum Eigensolver (PQE) is one such algorithms that optimizes the parameters of the chemistry-inspired unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz using a conventional coupled cluster-like residual minimization. Such a strategy involves the projection of the Schrodinger equation on to linearly independent basis towards the parameter optimization, restricting the ansatz is solely defined in terms of the excitation operators. This warrants the inclusion of high-rank operators for strongly correlated systems, leading to increased utilization of quantum resources. In this manuscript, we develop a methodology for determining the generalized operators in terms of a closed form residual equations in the PQE framework that can be efficiently implemented in a quantum computer with manageable quantum resources. Such a strategy requires the removal of the underlying redundancy in high-rank excited determinants, generated due to the presence of the generalized operators in the ansatz, by projecting them on to an internally contracted lower dimensional manifold. With the application on several molecular systems, we have demonstrated our ansatz achieves similar accuracy to the (disentangled) UCC with singles, doubles and triples (SDT) ansatz, while utilizing an order of magnitude fewer quantum gates. Furthermore, when simulated under stochastic Gaussian noise or depolarizing hardware noise, our method shows significantly improved noise resilience compared to the other members of PQE family and the state-of-the-art variational quantum eigensolver.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Observation of anomalous information scrambling in a Rydberg atom array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, which describes the propagation and effective loss of local information, is crucial for understanding the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In general, a typical interacting system would thermalize under time evolution, leading to the emergence of ergodicity and linear lightcones of information scrambling. Whereas, for a many-body localized system, strong disorders give rise to an extensive number of conserved quantities that prevent the system from thermalization, resulting in full ergodicity breaking and a logarithmic lightcone for information spreading. Here, we report the experimental observation of anomalous information scrambling in an atomic tweezer array. Working in the Rydberg blockade regime, where van der Waals interaction dominates, we observe a suppressed linear lightcone of information spreading characterized by out-of-time-order correlators for the initial N\'eel state, accompanied by persistent oscillations within the lightcone. Such an anomalous dynamics differs from both generic thermal and many-body localized scenarios. It originates from weak ergodicity breaking and is the characteristic feature for quantum many-body scars. The high-quality single-atom manipulations and coherent constraint dynamics, augmented by the effective protocol for time-reversed evolution we demonstrate, establish a versatile hybrid analog-digital simulation approach to explore diverse exotic non-equilibrium dynamics with atomic tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and hydrodynamic long-time tails in a Floquet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail, $t^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, \text{or } \frac{9}{4}$ for different operators. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. The numerical results are fully consistent with the emergence of hydrodynamics at long times.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Non-smooth Non-convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem for finding the $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary point of Lipschitz continuous objective, which is a rich function class to cover a great number of important applications. We construct a zeroth-order quantum estimator for the gradient of the smoothed surrogate. Based on such estimator, we propose a novel quantum algorithm that achieves a query complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ on the stochastic function value oracle, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem. We also enhance the query complexity to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-7/3})$ by introducing a variance reduction variant. Our findings demonstrate the clear advantages of utilizing quantum techniques for non-convex non-smooth optimization, as they outperform the optimal classical methods on the dependency of $\epsilon$ by a factor of $\epsilon^{-2/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is the fundamental physical task of learning a complete classical description of an unknown state of a quantum system given coherent access to many identical samples of it. The complexity of this task is commonly characterised by its sample-complexity: the minimal number of samples needed to reach a certain target precision of the description. While the sample complexity of quantum state tomography has been well studied, the memory complexity has not been investigated in depth. Indeed, the bottleneck in the implementation of na\"ive sample-optimal quantum state tomography is its massive quantum memory requirements. In this work, we propose and analyse a quantum state tomography algorithm which retains sample-optimality but is also memory-efficient. Our work is built on a form of unitary Schur sampling and only requires streaming access to the samples.</description>

      <title>Using a quantum SWAP engine to experimentally validate thermodynamic uncertainty relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) arise from the bounds on fluctuations of thermodynamics quantities during a non-equilibrium process and they impose constraints on the corresponding process. We experimentally implement a quantum SWAP engine on a nuclear magnetic resonance setup and demonstrate that a Gibbs thermal state can be prepared in two different ways, either directly from a thermal equilibrium state, or by first initializing the system in a pseudopure state. We show that the quantum SWAP engine can work both as a heat engine and as a refrigerator. Starting from a pseudopure state, we construct the SWAP engine, and investigate the violation of two different TURs, namely a generalized TUR and a tighter, more specific TUR. Our results validate that the generalized TUR is obeyed in all the working regimes of the SWAP engine, while the tighter TUR is violated in certain regimes. ~</description>

      <title>A Quantum Optimization Algorithm for Optimal Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement for Intercity Trips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) play a significant role in enhancing the sustainability of transportation systems. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by inadequate public charging infrastructure, particularly to support long-distance travel. Identifying optimal charging station locations in large transportation networks presents a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, as the search space grows exponentially with the number of potential charging station locations. This paper introduces a quantum search-based optimization algorithm designed to enhance the efficiency of solving this NP-hard problem for transportation networks. By leveraging quantum parallelism, amplitude amplification, and quantum phase estimation as a subroutine, the optimal solution is identified with a quadratic improvement in complexity compared to classical exact methods, such as branch and bound. The detailed design and complexity of a resource-efficient quantum circuit are discussed.</description>

      <title>Separations in query complexity for total search problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the query complexity analogue of the class TFNP of total search problems. We give a way to convert partial functions to total search problems under certain settings; we also give a way to convert search problems back into partial functions.
  As an application, we give new separations for degree-like measures. We give an exponential separation between quantum query complexity and approximate degree for a total search problem. We also give an exponential separation between approximate degree and the positive quantum adversary for a total search problem.
  We then strengthen the former separation to upper bound a larger measure: the two-sided approximate non-negative degree, also called the conical junta degree. This measure is often larger than quantum query complexity and even a separation from randomized query complexity was not known. We extend our results to communication complexity, and obtain an exponential separation between quantum information complexity and the relaxed partition bound for a total search problem. Even a weaker separation between randomized communication complexity and the relaxed partition bound was not known for total search problems (or even for partial functions).
  Most of our separations for total search problems can be converted to separations for partial functions. Using this, we reprove the recent exponential separation between quantum query complexity and approximate degree for a partial function by Ambainis and Belovs (2023), among other new results.</description>

      <title>Cups and Gates I: Cohomology invariants and logical quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take initial steps towards a general framework for constructing logical gates in general quantum CSS codes. Viewing CSS codes as cochain complexes, we observe that cohomology invariants naturally give rise to diagonal logical gates. We show that such invariants exist if the quantum code has a structure that relaxes certain properties of a differential graded algebra. We show how to equip quantum codes with such a structure by defining cup products on CSS codes. The logical gates obtained from this approach can be implemented by a constant-depth unitary circuit. In particular, we construct a $\Lambda$-fold cup product that can produce a logical operator in the $\Lambda$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy on $\Lambda$ copies of the same quantum code, which we call the copy-cup gate. For any desired $\Lambda$, we can construct several families of quantum codes that support gates in the $\Lambda$-th level with various asymptotic code parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the advantages of applying quantum approximate algorithms to portfolio optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for portfolio optimisation. Specifically, We present an end-to-end quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA) to solve the discrete global minimum variance portfolio (DGMVP) model. This model finds a portfolio of risky assets with the lowest possible risk contingent on the number of traded assets being discrete. We provide a complete pipeline for this model and analyses its viability for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. We design initial states, a cost operator, and ans\"atze with hard mixing operators within a binary encoding. Further, we perform numerical simulations to analyse several optimisation routines, including layerwise optimisation, utilising COYBLA and dual annealing. Finally, we consider the impacts of thermal relaxation and stochastic measurement noise. We find dual annealing with a layerwise optimisation routine provides the most robust performance. We observe that realistic thermal relaxation noise levels preclude quantum advantage. However, stochastic measurement noise will dominate when hardware sufficiently improves. Within this regime, we numerically demonstrate a favourable scaling in the number of shots required to obtain the global minimum -- an indication of quantum advantage in portfolio optimisation.</description>

      <title>A problem with the conservation law observed in macroscopic quantum phenomena is a consequence of violation of the correspondence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article draws attention that the puzzle of the change of the angular momentum without any force is a consequence of the contradiction of macroscopic quantum phenomena with the correspondence principle, which reveals a fundamental difference between microscopic quantum phenomena, described by the Schrodinger wave mechanics, and macroscopic quantum phenomena, described by the theory of superconductivity and the theory of superfluidity. To explain why macroscopic quantum phenomena are observed despite the correspondence principle, Lev Landau postulated in 1941 that microscopic particles in superfluid helium and superconductor cannot move separately. The angular momentum can change without any force only due to quantization in both microscopic and macroscopic quantum phenomena. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle eliminates the contradiction with the conservation law in the first case, since according to the correspondence principle, the change in angular momentum cannot exceed the Planck constant. But this principle cannot eliminate the contradiction with the conservation law the macroscopic change of angular momentum due to quantization observed in superconductors contrary to the correspondence principle. Quantization can change not only the angular momentum, but also the kinetic energy of a superconducting condensate on a macroscopic amount. For this reason, the Meissner effect and other macroscopic quantum phenomena contradict the second law of thermodynamics. The reluctance of physicists to admit the violation of the second law of thermodynamics provoked a false understanding of the phenomenon of superconductivity and obvious contradictions in books on superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Strong photon coupling to high-frequency antiferromagnetic magnons via topological surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show strong coupling between antiferromagnetic magnons and microwave cavity photons at both high and externally controllable magnon frequencies. Using the fully quantum mechanical path-integral method, we study an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM) interfaced with a topological insulator (TI), taking Bi$_2$Se$_3$--MnSe as a representative example. We show that the mutual coupling of the spin-polarized surface states of the TI to both the squeezed magnons and the circularly polarized cavity photons results in a Chern-Simons term that activates the stronger electric, rather than magnetic, dipole coupling. Moreover, a squeezing-mediated enhancement of the coupling is achieved due to the unequal interfacial exchange coupling to the AFM sublattices, resulting in a coupling strength up to several orders stronger than for direct magnon-photon coupling. While direct cavity-AFM coupling has so far been limited in its applicability due to weak or low frequency coupling, this result may advance the utilization of high-frequency cavity magnonics and enable its incorporation into quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Transport properties and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a one-dimensional electronic nanodevice inspired in recently fabricated semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SC-FMI) hybrid heterostructures, and investigate its zero-temperature transport properties. While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification of quantum phases is one of the most important areas of research in condensed matter physics. In this work, we obtain the phase diagram of one-dimensional quasiperiodic models via unsupervised learning. Firstly, we choose two advanced unsupervised learning algorithms, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS), to explore the distinct phases of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model and quasiperiodic p-wave model. The unsupervised learning results match well with traditional numerical diagonalization. Finally, we compare the similarity of different algorithms and find that the highest similarity between the results of unsupervised learning algorithms and those of traditional algorithms has exceeded 98\%. Our work sheds light on applications of unsupervised learning for phase classification.</description>

      <title>Moment method and continued fraction expansion in Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recursion methods such as Krylov techniques map complex dynamics to an effective non-interacting problem in one dimension. For example, the operator Krylov space for Floquet dynamics can be mapped to the dynamics of an edge operator of the one-dimensional Floquet inhomogeneous transverse field Ising model (ITFIM), where the latter, after a Jordan-Wigner transformation, is a Floquet model of non-interacting Majorana fermions, and the couplings correspond to Krylov angles. We present an application of this showing that a moment method exists where given an autocorrelation function, one can construct the corresponding Krylov angles, and from that the corresponding Floquet-ITFIM. Consequently, when no solutions for the Krylov angles are obtained, it indicates that the autocorrelation is not generated by unitary dynamics. We highlight this by studying certain special cases: stable $m$-periodic dynamics derived using the method of continued fractions, exponentially decaying and power-law decaying stroboscopic dynamics. Remarkably, our examples of stable $m$-periodic dynamics correspond to $m$-period edge modes for the Floquet-ITFIM where deep in the chain, the couplings correspond to a critical phase. Our results pave the way to engineer Floquet systems with desired properties of edge modes and also provide examples of persistent edge modes in gapless Floquet systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems have attracted growing attention due to the emergence of intriguing phenomena that are absent in equilibrium physics. In this letter, we identify a new class of Floquet criticality characterized by nontrivial topology. For generic driven Majorana fermion chains with chiral symmetry, we analytically demonstrate that Floquet driving can enrich the transition point, resulting in topologically distinct quantum critical lines that are absent in undriven systems. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive physical explanation for the underlying mechanism of the nontrivial topology at Floquet criticality and generalize our results to higher dimensions. This work not only extends the scope of topological physics in Floquet systems but also deepens our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabrication of quantum processors in advanced 300 mm wafer-scale complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundries provides a unique scaling pathway towards commercially viable quantum computing with potentially millions of qubits on a single chip. Here, we show precise qubit operation of a silicon two-qubit device made in a 300 mm semiconductor processing line. The key metrics including single- and two-qubit control fidelities exceed 99% and state preparation and measurement fidelity exceeds 99.9%, as evidenced by gate set tomography (GST). We report coherence and lifetimes up to $T_\mathrm{2}^{\mathrm{*}} = 30.4$ $\mu$s, $T_\mathrm{2}^{\mathrm{Hahn}} = 803$ $\mu$s, and $T_1 = 6.3$ s. Crucially, the dominant operational errors originate from residual nuclear spin carrying isotopes, solvable with further isotopic purification, rather than charge noise arising from the dielectric environment. Our results answer the longstanding question whether the favourable properties including high-fidelity operation and long coherence times can be preserved when transitioning from a tailored academic to an industrial semiconductor fabrication technology.</description>

      <title>Integration of Cobalt Ferromagnetic Control Gates for Electrical and Magnetic Manipulation of Semiconductor Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes however strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate FD-SOI nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible gate-first integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.</description>

Abstract: We develop an analytical approach to the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlators in zero-dimensional Brownian models of quantum chaos. The approach expresses these spectral correlations as part of a closed hierarchy of differential equations that can be formulated for all system sizes and in each of the three standard symmetry classes (unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic, as determined by the presence and nature of time reversal symmetry). The hierarchy applies exactly, and in the same form, to Dyson's Brownian motion and all systems with stochastically emerging basis invariance, where the model-dependent information is subsumed in a single dynamical timescale whose explicit form we also establish. We further verify this universality numerically for the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, for which we find perfect agreement with the analytical predictions of the symmetry class determined by the number of fermions. This results in a complete analytical description of the spectral correlations and allows us to identify which correlations are universal in a large class of models.</description>

      <title>Non-local detection of coherent Yu-Shiba-Rusinov quantum projections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing spatially confined quantum states from afar - a long-sought goal to minimize external interference - has been proposed to be achievable in condensed matter systems via coherent projection. The latter can be tailored by sculpturing the eigenstates of the electron sea that surrounds the quantum state using atom-by-atom built cages, so-called quantum corrals. However, assuring the coherent nature of the projection, and manipulating its quantum composition, has remained an elusive goal. Here, we experimentally realize the coherent projection of a magnetic impurity-induced, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov quantum state using the eigenmodes of corrals on the surface of a superconductor, which enables us to manipulate the particle-hole composition of the projected state by tuning corral eigenmodes through the Fermi energy. Our results demonstrate a controlled non-local method for the detection of magnet superconductor hybrid quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16060v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dipolar supersolids--quantum states which are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while its solid nature remains uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work, we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound: a supersonic shear wave. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individual quarks and gluons at small-$x$ inside an unpolarized hadron can be regarded as Bell states in which qubits in the spin and orbital angular momentum spaces are maximally entangled. Using the machinery of quantum information science, we generalize this observation to all values $0&lt;x&lt;1$ and describe gluons (but not quarks) as maximally entangled states between a qubit and a qudit. We introduce the conditional probability distribution $P(l^z|s^z)$ of a gluon's orbital angular momentum $l^z$ given its helicity $s^z$. Restricting to the three states $l^z=0,\pm 1$, which constitute a qutrit, we explicitly compute $P$ as a function of $x$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a technique that makes it possible to transform the intensity of a quasi-monochromatic single-photon wave packet, emitted by a radioactive M\"ossbauer gamma-ray source, into a sequence of short bursts with an arbitrary number of bursts, including a single burst. In addition, the technique allows one to individually and independently control, on demand, the moments of the burst appearance, as well as the peak intensity, duration and shape of each burst in the sequence. The technique is based on the transmission of M\"ossbauer (recoilless) photons through a resonantly absorbing medium, which is rapidly displaced at some moments of time relative to the source (or vice versa) along the photon propagation direction at a distance less than the photon wavelength, and returned to its original position. The burst durations can be comparable to the duration of the single-photon pulses produced by synchrotrons but have the controlled spectral-temporal characteristics. We show that the proposed technique can be implemented on the basis of currently available equipment with use of 14.4-keV recoilless photons, emitted by Co-57 source, and Fe-57 absorber, which opens up prospects for its applications in M\"ossbauer spectroscopy and x-ray quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor Circuits for Quantum Computing with Electronic Wave Packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard approaches to quantum computing require significant overhead to correct for errors. The hardware size for conventional quantum processors in solids often increases linearly with the number of physical qubits, such as for transmon qubits in superconducting circuits or electron spin qubits in quantum dot arrays. While photonic circuits based on flying qubits do not suffer from decoherence or lack of potential scalability, they have encountered significant challenges to overcome photon loss in long delay circuits. Here, we propose an alternative approach that utilizes flying electronic wave packets propagating in solid-state quantum semiconductor circuits. Using a novel time-bin architecture for the electronic wave packets, hardware requirements are drastically reduced because qubits can be created on-demand and manipulated with a common hardware element, unlike the localized approach of wiring each qubit individually. The electronic Coulomb interaction enables reliable coupling and readout of qubits. Improving upon previous devices, we realize electronic interference at the level of a single quantized mode that can be used for manipulation of electronic wavepackets. This important landmark lays the foundation for fault-tolerant quantum computing with a compact and scalable architecture based on electron interferometry in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Multi-product Zeno effect with higher order convergence rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To implement the dynamics of a projected Hamiltonian or Lindbladian, the quantum Zeno effect is a fundamental quantum phenomenon that approximates the effective dynamic by intersecting the Hamiltonian or Lindblad evolution by any quantum operation that converges to the desired projected subspace. Unlike the related Trotter product formula, the best-known convergence rate of the quantum Zeno effect is limited to the order $1/n$. In this work, we improve the convergence rate using a multi-product formula to achieve any power of $1/n^{K+1}$, employing a modified Chernoff Lemma, a modified Dunford-Segal approximation, and the holomorphic functional calculus. We then briefly illustrate this scheme using the bosonic cat code, as well as a broad class of examples governed by the `Bang-Bang' method used to decouple systems from their environment.</description>

      <title>Preparing Remote States for Genuine Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks typically comprise quantum channels, repeaters, and end nodes. Remote state preparation (RSP) allows one end node to prepare the states of the other end nodes remotely. While quantum discord has recently been recognized as necessary for RSP, it does not guarantee the practical implementation of RSP in quantum networks surpasses any classical method. Herein, we theoretically introduce and experimentally study a quantum resource that we call the RSP capability. This resource validates all the static and dynamic elements required to enable genuine quantum networks where the RSP's implementation can outperform any classical emulation of entanglement- and qubit-unitaries-free strategies, including the static resources of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs and the dynamic resources of quantum channels and repeaters. Our experiment measures the RSP capability to demonstrate the transition between classical and nonclassical RSP depending on the photon-pair qualities. It shows that quantum discord does not confirm a nonclassical RSP, but the RSP capability does. These results help reveal the quantum advantages that emerge when networking RSP is in play.</description>

      <title>A Computational Separation Between Quantum No-cloning and No-telegraphing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two of the fundamental no-go theorems of quantum information are the no-cloning theorem (that it is impossible to make copies of general quantum states) and the no-teleportation theorem (the prohibition on telegraphing, or sending quantum states over classical channels without pre-shared entanglement). They are known to be equivalent, in the sense that a collection of quantum states is telegraphable if and only if it is clonable.
  Our main result suggests that this is not the case when computational efficiency is considered. We give a collection of quantum states and quantum oracles relative to which these states are efficiently clonable but not efficiently telegraphable. Given that the opposite scenario is impossible (states that can be telegraphed can always trivially be cloned), this gives the most complete quantum oracle separation possible between these two important no-go properties.
  We additionally study the complexity class clonableQMA, a subset of QMA whose witnesses are efficiently clonable. As a consequence of our main result, we give a quantum oracle separation between clonableQMA and the class QCMA, whose witnesses are restricted to classical strings. We also propose a candidate oracle-free promise problem separating these classes. We finally demonstrate an application of clonable-but-not-telegraphable states to cryptography, by showing how such states can be used to protect against key exfiltration.</description>

      <title>Anderson impurity solver integrating tensor network methods with quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the Anderson impurity model typically involves a two-step process, where one first calculates the ground state of the Hamiltonian, and then computes its dynamical properties to obtain the Green's function. Here we propose a hybrid classical/quantum algorithm where the first step is performed using a classical computer to obtain the tensor network ground state as well as its quantum circuit representation, and the second step is executed on the quantum computer to obtain the Green's function. Our algorithm exploits the efficiency of tensor networks for preparing ground states on classical computers, and takes advantage of quantum processors for the evaluation of the time evolution, which can become intractable on classical computers.
  We demonstrate the algorithm using 24 qubits on a quantum computing emulator for SrVO$_3$ with a multi-orbital Anderson impurity model within the dynamical mean field theory. The tensor network based ground state quantum circuit preparation algorithm can also be performed for up to 60 qubits with our available computing resources, while the state vector emulation of the quantum algorithm for time evolution is beyond what is accessible with such resources.
  We show that, provided the tensor network calculation is able to accurately obtain the ground state energy, this scheme does not require a perfect reproduction of the ground state wave function on the quantum circuit to give an accurate Green's function. This hybrid approach may lead to quantum advantage in materials simulations where the ground state can be computed classically, but where the dynamical properties cannot.</description>

      <title>Hardness results for decoding the surface code with Pauli noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10331v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real quantum computers will be subject to complicated, qubit-dependent noise, instead of simple noise such as depolarizing noise with the same strength for all qubits. We can do quantum error correction more effectively if our decoding algorithms take into account this prior information about the specific noise present. This motivates us to consider the complexity of surface code decoding where the input to the decoding problem is not only the syndrome-measurement results, but also a noise model in the form of probabilities of single-qubit Pauli errors for every qubit.
  In this setting, we show that quantum maximum likelihood decoding (QMLD) and degenerate quantum maximum likelihood decoding (DQMLD) for the surface code are NP-hard and #P-hard, respectively. We reduce directly from SAT for QMLD, and from #SAT for DQMLD, by showing how to transform a boolean formula into a qubit-dependent Pauli noise model and set of syndromes that encode the satisfiability properties of the formula. We also give hardness of approximation results for QMLD and DQMLD. These are worst-case hardness results that do not contradict the empirical fact that many efficient surface code decoders are correct in the average case (i.e., for most sets of syndromes and for most reasonable noise models). These hardness results are nicely analogous with the known hardness results for QMLD and DQMLD for arbitrary stabilizer codes with independent $X$ and $Z$ noise.</description>

Abstract: We define predictive states and predictive complexity for quantum systems composed of distinct subsystems. This complexity is a generalization of entanglement entropy. It is inspired by the statistical or forecasting complexity of predictive state analysis of stochastic and complex systems theory, but is intrinsically quantum. Predictive states of a subsystem are formed by equivalence classes of state vectors in the exterior Hilbert space that effectively predict the same future behavior of that subsystem for some time. As an illustrative example, we present calculations in the dynamics of an isotropic Heisenberg model spin chain and show that, in comparison to the entanglement entropy, the predictive complexity better signifies dynamically important events, such as magnon collisions. It can also serve as a local order parameter that can distinguish long and short range entanglement.</description>

      <title>Problem-tailored Simulation of Energy Transport on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <title>Fixed-point Grover Adaptive Search for Quadratic Binary Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05592v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Grover-type method for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. For an $n$-dimensional QUBO problem with $m$ nonzero terms, we construct a marker oracle for such problems with a tuneable parameter, $\Lambda \in \left[ 1, m \right] \cap \mathbb{Z}$. At $d \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ precision, the oracle uses $O (n + \Lambda d)$ qubits, has total depth of $O \left( \tfrac{m}{\Lambda} \log_2 (n) + \log_2 (d) \right)$, and non-Clifford depth of $O \left( \tfrac{m}{\Lambda} \right)$. Moreover, each qubit required to be connected to at most $O \left( \log_2 (\Lambda + d) \right)$ other qubits. In the case of a maximum graph cuts, as $d = 2 \left\lceil \log_2 (n) \right\rceil$ always suffices, the depth of the marker oracle can be made as shallow as $O (\log_2 (n))$. For all values of $\Lambda$, the non-Clifford gate count of these oracles is strictly lower (at least by a factor of $\sim 2$) than previous constructions.
  Furthermore, we introduce a novel \textit{Fixed-point Grover Adaptive Search for QUBO Problems}, using our oracle design and a hybrid Fixed-point Grover Search, motivated by the works of Boyer et al. and Li et al. This method has better performance guarantees than previous Grover Adaptive Search methods. Some of our results are novel and useful for any method based on Fixed-point Grover Search. Finally, we give a heuristic argument that, with high probability and in $O \left( \tfrac{\log_2 (n)}{\sqrt{\epsilon}} \right)$ time, this adaptive method finds a configuration that is among the best $\epsilon 2^n$ ones.</description>

      <title>Observation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and Fermi skin on a digital quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has attracted considerable attention in recent years, particularly the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) for its extreme sensitivity and non-locality. While the NHSE has been physically observed in various classical metamaterials and even ultracold atomic arrays, its highly-nontrivial implications in many-body dynamics have never been experimentally investigated. In this work, we report the first observation of the NHSE on a universal quantum processor, as well as its characteristic but elusive Fermi skin from many-fermion statistics. To implement NHSE dynamics on a quantum computer, the effective time-evolution circuit not only needs to be non-reciprocal and non-unitary but must also be scaled up to a sufficient number of lattice qubits to achieve spatial non-locality. We show how such a non-unitary operation can be systematically realized by post-selecting multiple ancilla qubits, as demonstrated through two paradigmatic non-reciprocal models on a noisy IBM quantum processor, with clear signatures of asymmetric spatial propagation and many-body Fermi skin accumulation. To minimize errors from inevitable device noise, time evolution is performed using a trainable, optimized quantum circuit produced with variational quantum algorithms. Our study represents a critical milestone in the quantum simulation of non-Hermitian lattice phenomena on present-day quantum computers and can be readily generalized to more sophisticated many-body models with the remarkable programmability of quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Error Cancellation in Analog Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulation is a promising path towards solving classically intractable problems in many-body physics on near-term quantum devices. However, the presence of noise limits the size of the system and the length of time that can be simulated. In our work, we consider an error model in which the actual Hamiltonian of the simulator differs from the target Hamiltonian we want to simulate by small local perturbations, which are assumed to be random and unbiased. We analyze the error accumulated in observables in this setting and show that, due to stochastic error cancellation, with high probability the error scales as the square root of the number of qubits instead of linearly. We explore the concentration phenomenon of this error as well as its implications for local observables in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we show that stochastic error cancellation also manifests in the fidelity between the target state at the end of time-evolution and the actual state we obtain in the presence of noise. This indicates that, to reach a certain fidelity, more noise can be tolerated than implied by the worst-case bound if the noise comes from many statistically independent sources.</description>

      <title>Multi-copy activation of genuine multipartite entanglement in continuous-variable systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-copy activation of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a phenomenon whereby multiple copies of biseparable but fully inseparable states can exhibit GME. This was shown to be generically possible in finite dimensions. Here, we extend this analysis to infinite dimensions. We provide examples of GME-activatable non-Gaussian states. For Gaussian states, we apply a necessary biseparability criterion for the covariance matrix and show that it cannot detect GME activation. We further identify fully inseparable Gaussian states that satisfy the criterion but show that multiple and, in some cases, even single copies are GME. Thus, we show that the covariance-matrix biseparability criterion is not sufficient even for Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Extended local ergotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum thermodynamics is to properly quantify the work extractable from out-of-equilibrium systems. While for closed systems, maximum quantum work extraction is defined in terms of the ergotropy functional, this question is unclear in open systems interacting with an environment. The concept of local ergotropy has been proposed, but it presents several problems, such as it is not guaranteed to be non-increasing in time. Here we introduce the concept of extended local ergotropy by exploiting the free evolution of the system-environment compound. At variance with the local ergotropy, the extended local ergotropy is greater, is non-increasing in time, and activates the potential of work extraction in many cases. We then concentrate on specific schemes in which we alternate repeated local unitaries and free system-environment evolution. We provide examples based on the Jaynes-Cummings model, presenting practical protocols and analytic results that serve as proof of principle for the aforementioned advantages.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum advantages for practical non-Hermitian eigenproblems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian physics has attracted considerable attention, current studies are limited to small or classically solvable systems. Quantum computing, as a powerful eigensolver, have predominantly been applied to Hermitian domain, leaving their potential for studying non-Hermitian problems largely unexplored. We extend the power of quantum computing to general non-Hermitian eigenproblems. Our approach works for finding eigenvalues without extra constrains, or eigenvalues closest to specified points or lines, thus extending results for ground energy and energy gap problems for Hermitian matrices. Our algorithms have broad applications, and as examples, we consider two central problems in non-Hermitian physics. Firstly, our approach is the first to offer an efficient quantum solution to the witness of spontaneous $PT$-symmetry breaking, and provide provable, exponential quantum advantage. Secondly, our approach enables the estimation of Liouvillian gap, which is crucial for characterizing relaxation times. Our general approach can also find applications in many other areas, such as the study of Markovian stochastic processes. These results underscore the significance of our quantum algorithms for addressing practical eigenproblems across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Work Sum Rule for Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key question in the thermodynamics of open quantum systems is how to partition thermodynamic quantities such as entropy, work, and internal energy between the system and its environment. We show that the only partition under which entropy is nonsingular is based on a partition of Hilbert space, which assigns half the system-environment coupling to the system and half to the environment. However, quantum work partitions nontrivially under Hilbert-space partition, and we derive a work sum rule that accounts for quantum work at a distance. All state functions of the system are shown to be path independent once this nonlocal quantum work is properly accounted for. Our results are illustrated with application to a driven resonant level strongly coupled to a reservoir.</description>

      <title>Realistic photon-number resolution in Gaussian boson sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a model of nonuniversal quantum computation that claims to demonstrate quantum supremacy with current technologies. This model entails sampling photocounting events from a multimode Gaussian state at the outputs of a linear interferometer. In this scheme, collision events -- those with more than one photon for each mode -- are infrequent. However, they are still used for validation purposes. Therefore, the limitation of realistic detectors to perfectly resolve adjacent photon numbers becomes pivotal. We derive a the photocounting probability distribution in GBS schemes which is applicable for use with general detectors and photocounting techniques. This probability distribution is expressed in terms of functionals of the field-quadrature covariance matrix, e.g., Hafnian and Torontonian in the well-known special cases of photon-number resolving and on-off detectors, respectively. Based on our results, we consider a GBS validation technique involving detectors with realistic photon-number resolution.</description>

Abstract: We present an explicit quantum circuit that prepares an arbitrary $U(1)$-eigenstate on a quantum computer, including the exact eigenstates of the spin-1/2 XXZ quantum spin chain with either open or closed boundary conditions. The algorithm is deterministic, does not require ancillary qubits, and does not require QR decompositions. The circuit prepares such an $L$-qubit state with $M$ down-spins using $\binom{L}{M}-1$ multi-controlled rotation gates and $2M(L-M)$ CNOT-gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an alternative to quantum error correction, quantum error mitigation methods, including Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), have been proposed to alleviate run-time errors in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we propose a modified version of ZNE that provides for a significant performance enhancement on current noisy devices. Our modified ZNE method extrapolates to zero-noise data by evaluating groups of noisy data obtained from noise-scaled circuits and selecting extrapolation functions for each group with the assistance of estimated noisy simulation results. To quantify enhancement in a real-world quantum application, we embed our modified ZNE in Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) - a memory system important for future quantum networks and computers. Our new ZNE-enhanced QRAM designs are experimentally implemented on a 27-qubit noisy superconducting quantum device, the results of which demonstrate QRAM fidelity can be improved significantly relative to traditional ZNE usage. Our results demonstrate the critical role the extrapolation function plays in ZNE - judicious choice of that function on a per-measurement basis can make the difference between a quantum application being functional or non-functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of an Ising spin network for quantum reservoir computing (QRC) in linear and non-linear memory tasks. We investigate the extent to which quantumness enhances performance by monitoring the behaviour of quantum entanglement, which we quantify by the partial transpose of the density matrix. In the most general case where the effects of dissipation are incorporated, our results indicate that the strength of the entanglement advantage depends on the frequency of the input signal; the benefit of entanglement is greater with more rapidly fluctuating signals, whereas a low-frequency input is better suited to a non-entangled reservoir. This may be understood as a condition for an entanglement advantage to manifest itself: the system's quantum memory must survive for long enough for the temporal structure of the input signal to reveal itself. We also find that quantum entanglement empowers a spin-network quantum reservoir to remember a greater number of temporal features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preparation of thermal states of matter is a crucial task in quantum simulation. In this work, we prove that a recently introduced, efficiently implementable dissipative evolution thermalizes to the Gibbs state in time scaling polynomially with system size at high enough temperatures for any Hamiltonian that satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice. Furthermore, we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the associated purifications or "thermofield double" states. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the efficient preparation of high-temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the low-temperature regime, we show that implementing this family of dissipative evolutions for inverse temperatures polynomial in the system's size is computationally equivalent to standard quantum computations. On a technical level, for high temperatures, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of the evolution into a Hamiltonian, and then connecting its convergence to that of the infinite temperature limit. For low temperature, we instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature and resort to circuit-to-Hamiltonian mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum adiabatic computing. Taken together, our results show that a family of quasi-local dissipative evolutions efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many-body states of interest, and has the potential to mirror the success of classical Monte Carlo methods for quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: The behavior of quantum states at exceptional points and critical points in quantum phase transitions is intriguing yet puzzling. In this study, we demonstrate, without applying the adiabatic approximation, that the information carried by quantum states evolving across these critical points is not destroyed. Instead, the quantum states remain unaffected by the critical points, much like an object passing through a classical black hole's event horizon. Further similarities between exceptional points, quantum phase transitions, and classical black hole event horizons are explored in this work.</description>

Abstract: The quantum state discrimination problem has Alice sending a quantum state to Bob who wins if he correctly identifies the state. The pretty good measurement, also known as the square root measurement, performs pretty well at this task. We study the version of this problem where Bob tries to lose with the greatest probability possible (which is harder than it sounds). We define the pretty bad measurement which performs pretty well at this task, or in other words, pretty poorly for the original task. We show that both the pretty good measurement and the pretty bad measurement are always no worse than blind guessing at their respective tasks. As an application, we apply the pretty bad measurement to the quantum state anomaly detection problem and show how to avoid pretty bad qubits.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer entropies are monotones for magic-state resource theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic-state resource theory is a powerful tool with applications in quantum error correction, many-body physics, and classical simulation of quantum dynamics. Despite its broad scope, finding tractable resource monotones has been challenging. Stabilizer entropies have recently emerged as promising candidates (being easily computable and experimentally measurable detectors of nonstabilizerness) though their status as true resource monotones has been an open question ever since. In this Letter, we establish the monotonicity of stabilizer entropies for $\alpha \geq 2$ within the context of magic-state resource theory restricted to pure states. Additionally, we show that linear stabilizer entropies serve as strong monotones. Furthermore, we extend stabilizer entropies to mixed states as monotones via convex roof constructions, whose computational evaluation significantly outperforms optimization over stabilizer decompositions for low-rank density matrices. As a direct corollary, we provide improved conversion bounds between resource states, revealing a preferred direction of conversion between magic states. These results conclusively validate the use of stabilizer entropies within magic-state resource theory and establish them as the only known family of monotones that are experimentally measurable and computationally tractable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work, we defined a quantum algorithmic technique known as the Generalised Phase Kick-Back, or $GPK$, and analysed its applications in generalising some classical quantum problems, such as the Deutsch-Jozsa problem or the Bernstein-Vazirani problem. We also proved that using this technique we can solve Simon's problem in a more efficient manner. In this paper we continue analysing the potential of this technique, defining the concept of $\mathbf{y}$-balanced functions and solving a new problem, which further generalises the generalised Deutsch-Jozsa problem (the fully balanced image problem). This problem also underlines the relation between quantum computation and Boolean function theory, and, in particular, the Walsh and Fourier-Hadamard transforms. We finish our discussion by solving the generalised version of Simon's problem using the $GPK$ algorithm, while analysing the efficiency of this new solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that combining ideas from the fields of quantum invariants and of optimal control can be used to design optimal quantum control solutions without explicit reference to quantum states. The states are specified only implicitly in terms of operators to which they are eigenstates. The scaling in numerical effort of the resultant approach is not given by the typically exponentially growing effort required for the specification of a time-evolved quantum state, but it is given by the effort required for the specification of a time-evolved operator. For certain Hamiltonians, this effort can be polynomial in the system size. We describe how control problems for state preparation and the realization of propagators can be formulated in this approach, and we provide explicit control solutions for a spin chain with an extended Ising Hamiltonian. The states considered for state-preparation protocols include eigenstates of Hamiltonians with more than pairwise interactions, and these Hamiltonians are also used for the definition of target propagators. The cost of describing suitable time-evolving operators grows only quadratically with the system size, allowing us to construct explicit control solutions for up to 50 spins. While sub-exponential scaling is obtained only in special cases, we provide several examples that demonstrate favourable scaling beyond the extended Ising model.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Insights on Entanglement-trainability Correlation of Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as the leading strategy to obtain quantum advantage on the current noisy intermediate-scale devices. However, their entanglement-trainability correlation, as the major reason for the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon, poses a challenge to their applications. In this Letter, we suggest a gate-to-tensor (GTT) encoding method for parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), with which two long short-term memory networks (L-G networks) are trained to predict both entanglement and trainability. The remarkable capabilities of the L-G networks afford a statistical way to delve into the entanglement-trainability correlation of PQCs within a dataset encompassing millions of instances. This machine-learning-driven method first confirms that the more entanglement, the more possible the BP problem. Then, we observe that there still exist PQCs with both high entanglement and high trainability. Furthermore, the trained L-G networks result in an impressive increase in time efficiency by about one million times when constructing a PQC with specific entanglement and trainability, demonstrating their practical applications in VQAs.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in monitored single-particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multifractal properties in time evolution of a single particle subject to repeated measurements. For quantum systems, we consider circuit models consisting of local unitary gates and local projective measurements. For classical systems, we consider models for estimating the trajectory of a particle evolved under local transition processes by partially measuring particle occupations. In both cases, multifractal behaviors appear in the ensemble of wave functions or probability distributions conditioned on measurement outcomes after a sufficiently long time. While the nature of particle transport (diffusive or ballistic) qualitatively affects the multifractal properties, they are even quantitatively robust to the measurement rate or specific protocols. On the other hand, multifractality is generically lost by generalized measurements allowing erroneous outcomes or by postselection of the outcomes with no particle detection. We demonstrate these properties by numerical simulations and also propose several simplified models, which allow us to analytically obtain multifractal properties in the monitored single-particle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the phase-controlled bound state out of the continuum~(BOC) and bound state in the continuum~(BIC) in an artificial giant atom dressed one-dimensional photonic waveguide where the giant atom couples to the waveguide via two distant sites. We obtain the existence condition of the BOC as well as the frequency and the photonic distribution in the BIC. More interestingly, we predict the quantum beats in the atomic and photonic dynamical evolution, which is induced by the oscillation between the BIC and the BOCs. These findings provide an approach to manipulate the waveguide system via the bound states.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Approach to Mitigate Errors in Linear Photonic Bell-State Measurement for Quantum Interconnects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical quantum information processing critically relies on Bell-state measurement, a ubiquitous operation for quantum communication and computing. Its practical realization involves the interference of optical modes and the detection of a single photon in an indistinguishable manner. Yet, in the absence of efficient photon-number resolution capabilities, errors arise from multi-photon components, decreasing the overall process fidelity. Here, we introduce a novel hybrid detection scheme for Bell-state measurement, leveraging both on-off single-photon detection and quadrature conditioning via homodyne detection. We derive explicit fidelities for quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping processes employing this strategy, demonstrating its efficacy. We also compare with photon-number resolving detectors and find a strong advantage of the hybrid scheme in a wide range of parameters. This work provides a new tool for linear optics schemes, with applications to quantum state engineering and quantum interconnects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a framework to determine the upper bound to the complexity of a computing a given observable with respect to a Hamiltonian. By considering the Heisenberg evolution of the observable, we show that each Hamiltonian defines an equivalence relation, causing the operator space to be partitioned into equivalence classes. Any operator within a specific class never leaves its equivalence class during the evolution. We provide a method to determine the dimension of the equivalence classes and evaluate it for various models, such as the $ XY $ chain and Kitaev model on trees. Our findings reveal that the complexity of operator evolution in the $XY$ model grows from the edge to the bulk, which is physically manifested as suppressed relaxation of qubits near the boundary. Our methods are used to reveal several new cases of simulable quantum dynamics, including a $XY$-$ZZ$ model which cannot be reduced to free fermions.</description>

Abstract: We study the preparation of thermal states of the dense and sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model using a variational quantum algorithm for $6 \le N \le 12$ Majorana fermions over a wide range of temperatures. Utilizing IBM's 127-qubit quantum processor, we perform benchmark computations for the dense SYK model with $N = 6$, showing good agreement with exact results. The preparation of thermal states of a non-local random Hamiltonian with all-to-all coupling using the simulator and quantum hardware represents a significant step toward future computations of thermal out-of-time order correlators in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Frequency Combs for Satellite-based Clock Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of space-based networks will contain optical clocks embedded within satellites. To fully realize the capabilities of such clocks, high-precision clock synchronization across the networks will be necessary. Current experiments have shown the potential for classical frequency combs to synchronize remote optical clocks over free-space. However, these classical combs are restricted in precision to the standard quantum limit. Quantum frequency combs, however, which exhibit quantum properties such as squeezing and entanglement, provide pathways for going beyond the standard quantum limit. Here, we present our perspective on the prospects for practical clock synchronization in space using both classical and quantum frequency combs. We detail the current outcomes achievable with a classical frequency comb approach to synchronization, before quantifying the potential outcomes offered by quantum frequency combs. Challenges to be overcome in deploying frequency combs in space are presented, and the implications of almost-perfect synchronization for future space-based applications and experiments discussed.</description>

Abstract: We show that quantum entanglement states are associated with multilinear polynomials that cannot be factored. By using these multilinear polynomials, we propose a geometric representation for entanglement states. In particular, we show that the Bell's states are associated with non-factorable real multilinear polynomial, which can be represented geometrically by three-dimensional surfaces. Furthermore, in this framework, we show that a quantum circuit can be seen as a geometric transformations of plane geometry. This phenomenon is analogous to gravity, where matter curves space-time. In addition, we show an analogy between quantum teleportation and operations involving multilinear polynomials.</description>

      <title>Generating Fock-state superpositions from coherent states by selective measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fock states and their superpositions are exotic testbeds for nonclassical physics and valuable resources for quantum technologies. We provide a simple protocol for the quantum measurement to generate an arbitrary Fock state and certain superposed Fock states from a coherent state of a target resonator, without any carefully tailored driving. This conditional protocol can be efficiently constructed by a sequence of joint free evolution of the resonator and an ancillary qubit, which are coupled via a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and projective measurements on the qubit. By properly choosing the duration of each evolution-measurement cycle and the initial state of the resonator, we can generate a desired Fock state $|n\rangle$ and a superposed Fock state $(|0\rangle+|n\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, $n\sim10$, with a fidelity over $99\%$ in less than $30$ measurements. Moreover, our protocol can be extended straightforwardly to the generation of a Bell-like state $(|00\rangle+|nn\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ with multiple excitations in a double-resonator system. We also calculate the outcome fidelity and the success probability of our protocol in the presence of decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics in a circularly polarized electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron rotating under the field leads to the quantum recoil force acting on the electron perpendicularly to the velocity of its forward movement, which differs crucially from the known classical recoil force directed oppositely to the velocity. Physically, such an anomalous radiation reaction arises from the one-loop QED correction to the photon emission and has no analogue within the classical electrodynamics. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for electrons in strong laser fields.</description>

      <title>Faster Quantum Simulation Of Markovian Open Quantum Systems Via Randomisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with quantum computers, it is essential to accurately approximate the system's behaviour while preserving the physicality of its evolution. Traditionally, for Markovian open quantum systems, this has been achieved using first and second-order Trotter-Suzuki product formulas or probabilistic algorithms. In this work, we introduce novel non-probabilistic algorithms for simulating Markovian open quantum systems using randomisation. Our methods, including first and second-order randomised Trotter-Suzuki formulas and the QDRIFT channel, not only maintain the physicality of the system's evolution but also enhance the scalability and precision of quantum simulations. We derive error bounds and step count limits for these techniques, bypassing the need for the mixing lemma typically employed in Hamiltonian simulation proofs. We also present two implementation approaches for these randomised algorithms: classical sampling and quantum forking, demonstrating their gate complexity advantages over deterministic Trotter-Suzuki product formulas. This work is the first to apply randomisation techniques to the simulation of open quantum systems, highlighting their potential to enable faster and more accurate simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution (DM-CV-QKD) has gained traction due to its practical advantages: cost-effectiveness, simple state preparation, and compatibility with existing communication technologies. This work presents a security analysis of DM-CV-QKD against general sequential attacks, including finite-size effects. Remarkably, our proof considers attacks that are neither independent nor identical, and makes no assumptions about the Hilbert space dimension of the receiver. To analyse the security, we leverage the recent generalised entropy accumulation theorem and the numerical methods based on quasi-relative entropy. We also develop a novel dimension reduction technique which is compatible with the entropy accumulation framework. While our analysis reveals significant finite-size corrections to the key rate, the protocol might still offer advantages in specific scenarios due to its practical merits. Our work also offers some insights on how future security proofs can improve the security bounds derived in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum dot spin chain system is vital for quantum simulation and studying collective electron behaviors, necessitating an understanding of its mechanisms and control protocols. Chapter 1 introduces key concepts, focusing on the extended Hubbard model, double quantum dot systems, and electron-phonon coupling. Chapter 2 explores electron-phonon coupling in multielectron double quantum dots under unbiased and biased scenarios via detuning variations. In the unbiased case, dephasing due to electron-phonon coupling generally increases with more electrons in the right dot; this trend is inconsistent in the biased case, suggesting potential advantages of multielectron quantum dots under certain conditions. Chapter 3 investigates entanglement entropy in a multielectron quantum dot spin chain described by the extended Hubbard model. Local and pairwise entanglement are influenced by Coulomb interactions, tunneling strengths, electronic configurations, and site potential energies. The entanglement diagram reveals phase transitions significantly impacted by coupling strength ratios and potential energy variations; adjusting the potential energy of a specific dot critically influences ground state configurations and entanglement entropy. Chapter 4, inspired by the decoherence-free subspace concept, explores operation sequences in a nine-spin, nine-quantum-dot system defined by the Heisenberg model, with bases determined by total angular momentum quantum numbers. Employing the Krotov method of quantum optimal control, we identify a more efficient pulse-level operation sequence for an exchange-only quantum dot spin chain, offering a superior alternative to conventional quantum gate decomposition and potentially enhancing the development of more concise quantum algorithm representations.</description>

Abstract: The practical implementation of quantum optimization algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices requires accounting for their limited connectivity. As such, the Parity architecture was introduced to overcome this limitation by encoding binary optimization problems onto planar quantum chips. We investigate the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on the Parity architecture (Parity QAOA) for solving instances of the signed Max-Cut problem on complete and regular graphs. By comparing the algorithms at fixed circuit depth, we demonstrate that Parity QAOA outperforms conventional QAOA implementations based on SWAP networks. Our analysis utilizes Clifford circuits to estimate lower performance bounds for Parity QAOA for problem sizes that would be otherwise inaccessible on classical computers. For single layer circuits we additionally benchmark the recursive variant of the two algorithms, showing that their performance is equal.</description>

      <title>General recipe for immediate entanglement death-birth transitions via Bell states: environmental Heisenberg exchange as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environment is known to play a dual role in both extinguishing and establishing entanglement, leading to entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth (ESB). In this paper, we propose a recipe for the initial states of two qubits to undergo ESD, ESB, or transition of finite duration (TFD) between them. While this recipe is \emph{generally independent of the interaction}, a spin-star model with environmental Heisenberg exchange is chosen for illustration. Utilizing the Bell states, we introduce the entanglement switch parameter (ESP), whose sign indicates whether the qubit bipartite entanglement is switched on or off. The classical (quantum) weighting of the Bell states encodes the ESP for initial mixed (pure) states. When more than two Bell states are adopted, the ESP permits states to penetrate through the entanglement-unentanglement boundary. In this case, the penetrability of a small ESP ensures the immediate occurrence of ESD or ESB and indicates the TFD if the local time-even symmetry in the entanglement monotone is also satisfied. When no more than two Bell states are employed, the penetrability is lost, and TFD is only identified in some mixed states but not in pure states; here for pure states, the environmental quantum degrees of freedom are associated with the number of Bell states. Thanks to the simplicity of this model, analytic results are provided. We also analyze the symmetries that can convert or alter ESD into ESB, and vice versa. The recipe enhances the controllability of entanglement dynamics and facilitates entanglement engineering.</description>

      <title>The aspect of bipartite coherence in quantum discord to semi-device-independent nonlocality and its implication for quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \textit{Quantum discord} can demonstrate \textit{quantum nonlocality} in the context of a \textit{semi-device-independent} Bell or steering scenario, i.e., by assuming only the Hilbert-space dimension.
  This work addresses which aspect of \textit{bipartite coherence} is essential to such semi-device-independent quantum information tasks going beyond standard Bell nonlocality or quantum steering. It has been shown that the \textit{global coherence} of a single system can be transformed into \textit{bipartite entanglement}.
  However, global coherence can also be present in quantum discord. At the same time, discord can display bipartite coherence locally, i.e., only in a subsystem or both subsystems. Thus, global coherence of bipartite separable states is defined here as a form of bipartite coherence that is not reducible to local coherence in any of the subsystems or both subsystems. To answer the above-mentioned question, we demonstrate that global coherence is necessary to demonstrate semi-device-independent nonlocality of quantum discord in Bell or steering scenarios. From this result, it follows that any \textit{local operations} of the form $\Phi_A \otimes \Phi_B$ that may create \textit{coherence locally} are \textit{free operations} in the resource theory of semi-device-independent nonlocality of discord. As a byproduct, we identify the precise quantum resource for the quantum communication task of \textit{remote state preparation} using two-qubit separable states.</description>

      <title>Positive Conserved Quantities in the Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an embedding of the Klein-Gordon equation into a pair of coupled equations that are first-order in time. The existence of such an embedding is based on a positivity property exhibited by the Klein-Gordon equation. These coupled equations provide a more satisfactory reduction of the Klein-Gordon equation to first-order differential equations in time than the Schrodinger equation. Using this embedding, we show that the "negative probabilities" associated with the Klein-Gordon equation do not need to be resolved by introducing matrices as Dirac did with his eponymous equation. For the case of the massive Klein-Gordon equation, the coupled equations are equivalent to a forward Schrodinger equation in time and a backward Schrodinger equation in time, respectively, corresponding to a particle and its antiparticle. We show that there are two positive integrals that are conserved (constant in time) in the Klein-Gordon equation and thus provide a concrete resolution of the historical puzzle regarding the previously supposed lack of a probabilistic interpretation for the field governed by the Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

      <title>QOPS: A Compiler Framework for Quantum Circuit Simulation Acceleration with Profile Guided Optimizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation is important in the evolution of quantum software and hardware. Novel algorithms can be developed and evaluated by performing quantum circuit simulations on classical computers before physical quantum computers are available. Unfortunately, compared with a physical quantum computer, a prolonged simulation time hampers the rapid development of quantum algorithms. Inspired by the feedback-directed optimization scheme used by classical compilers to improve the generated code, this work proposes a quantum compiler framework QOPS to enable profile-guided optimization (PGO) for quantum circuit simulation acceleration. The QOPS compiler instruments a quantum simulator to collect performance data during the circuit simulation and it then generates the optimized version of the quantum circuit based on the collected data. Experimental results show the PGO can effectively shorten the simulation time on our tested benchmark programs. Especially, the simulator-specific PGO (virtual swap) can be applied to the benchmarks to accelerate the simulation speed by a factor of 1.19. As for the hardware-independent PGO, compared with the brute force mechanism (turning on all available compilation flags), which achieves 21% performance improvement against the non-optimized version, the PGO can achieve 16% speedup with a factor of 63 less compilation time than the brute force approach.</description>

      <title>Wide-range quantum enhanced rotation sensing with 1+2 dimensional dynamical decoupling techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a motional dynamical decoupling technique by utilizing a sequence of $\pi$-phase shifts, instead of the conventional $\pi$-pulses for spin flipping, to implement the quantum enhanced rotation sensing with a 1+2 dimensional hybrid atomic Sagnic interferometor. By fully disentangling the spin from the two-dimensional vibrational modes of the particle under rotation, the spin coherence time and thus the phase accumulation can be significantly increased. Consequently, both the achievable sensitivity and dynamic range of the rotation sensing can be significantly enhanced and extended simultaneously, compared to the previous schemes where the spin and motions of the particle were not completely decoupled. The experimental feasibility for the unambiguous estimation of the rotation parameters is also discussed. Hopefully, this technique holds promise for overcoming certain challenges existing in the usual matter-wave Sagnac interferometers with trapped particles, particularly for the practical inertial navigation that demands both high sensitivity and large dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum Control Algorithm Design by Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision measurements of polyatomic molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in a single, pure quantum state. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated in the case of a CaH$^+$ ion, with up to 96 thermally populated eigenstates and under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. We expect that the method developed, with physics-informed learning, will be directly implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical shifts and J-couplings are fundamental parameters in NMR spectroscopy as they provide structural information about molecules. Extracting these quantities from isotopes such as carbon or nitrogen results in reduced sensitivity due to their low gyromagnetic ratios. In this work, we present a method for detecting chemical shifts and J-couplings at the microscale in low-gyromagnetic-ratio nuclei using NV centers. By leveraging hydrogen nuclei, we achieve strong coupling with NVs and fast signal emission that aligns with NV coherence times. In addition, the technique is well-suited for implementations under high magnetic fields. We demonstrate that our protocol achieves a sensitivity enhancement of more than one order of magnitude for scenarios involving $^{13}$C, with even greater improvements for nuclei with lower gyromagnetic ratios.</description>

Abstract: We consider the fermionic entanglement entropy for the free Dirac field in a bounded spatial region of Minkowski spacetime. In order to make the system ultraviolet finite, a regularization is introduced. An area law is proven in the limiting cases where the volume tends to infinity and/or the regularization length tends to zero. The technical core of the paper is to generalize a theorem of Harold Widom to pseudo-differential operators whose principal symbols develop a specific discontinuity at a single point.</description>

      <title>A call for frugal modelling: two case studies involving molecular spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $&gt;4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</description>

      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates how the closed channel of a Feshbach resonance is characterised by experimental observables. Surprisingly, it is found that the two-body observables associated with the Feshbach resonance can be insensitive to the properties of the closed channel. In particular, it is impossible in this situation to determine the energy of the bound state causing the resonance from the usual experimental data. This is the case for all magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atoms, due to their deep two-body interaction potentials. This insensitivity highlights a major difference with Feshbach resonances that involve shallow interaction potentials, such as hadron resonances. It appears however that short-range two-body correlations and three-body observables are affected by a parameter of the closed channel called the "closed-channel scattering length". A photoassociation experiment is proposed to measure this parameter in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Probing electron quadrupling order through ultrasound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have pointed to the formation of a new state of matter, the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$. The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the superconducting and normal-metal states. We report a theory of the acoustic effects of systems with an electron quadrupling phase based on ultrasound-velocity measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. The theoretical analysis suggests that the ultrasound data can be understood by considering a plain $s$+i$d_{xy}$ order parameter or an $s$+i$s$ order parameter with symmetry-breaking deformations in this material with enhanced nematic susceptibility for the [110] direction, or when the transition to the quartic state is a weakly first-order. Our work provides the theoretical basis and proposes the experimental strategy to study the order parameter symmetry of emerging quadrupling condensates in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Vacuum currents in curved tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on rotationally symmetric 2D curved tubes. For a general spatial geometry and for quasiperiodicity condition with a general phase, the representation of the Hadamard function is provided where the topological contribution is explicitly extracted. As an important local characteristic of the vacuum state the expectation value of the current density is studied. The vacuum current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the tube with the period of flux quantum. The general formula is specified for constant radius and conical tubes. As another application, we consider the Hadamard function and the vacuum current density for a scalar field on the Beltrami pseudosphere. Several representations are provided for the corresponding expectation value. For small values of the proper radius of the tube, compared with the curvature radius, the effect of spatial curvature on the vacuum current is weak and the leading term in the corresponding expansion coincides with the current density on a constant radius tube. The effect of curvature is essential for proper radii of the tube larger than the radius of spatial curvature. In this limit the fall-off of the current density, as a function of the proper radius, follows a power-law for both massless and massive fields. This behavior is in clear contrast to the one for a constant radius tube with exponential decay for massive fields. We also compare the vacuum currents on the Beltrami pseudosphere and on locally de Sitter and anti-de Sitter 2D tubes.</description>

      <title>Janus graphene nanoribbons with a single ferromagnetic zigzag edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological design of pi-electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases. Symmetric ZGNRs typically exhibit antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a new class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the 1D limit, but also establishes a long-sought carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics. However, designing such GNRs entails overcoming daunting challenges, including simultaneous breaking of structural and spin symmetries, and designing elegant precursors for asymmetric fabrication of reactive zigzag edges. Here, we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb's theorem and topological classification theory, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introduced a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin symmetry breaking. Three Z-shape precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the defective edge. Characterization via scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of Janus GNRs with ferromagnetic ground state delocalised along the pristine zigzag edge.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric transfer matrix analysis of Lyapunov exponents in one-dimensional non-reciprocal quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lyapunov exponent, serving as an indicator of the localized state, is commonly utilized to identify localization transitions in disordered systems. In non-Hermitian quasicrystals, the non-Hermitian effect induced by non-reciprocal hopping can lead to the manifestation of two distinct Lyapunov exponents on opposite sides of the localization center. Building on this observation, we here introduce a comprehensive approach for examining the localization characteristics and mobility edges of non-reciprocal quasicrystals, referred to as asymmetric transfer matrix analysis. We demonstrate the application of this method to three specific scenarios: the non-reciprocal Aubry-Andr\'e model, the non-reciprocal off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e model, and the non-reciprocal mosaic quasicrystals. This work may contribute valuable insights to the investigation of non-Hermitian quasicrystal and disordered systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper looks at the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics, namely quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and black holes. We discuss theorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the classical realm. The notion of a ``semi-classical subspace'' is introduced. Partial signals and partial information cloning can be obtained on quantum states in semi-classical subspaces. The No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says separate and isolated physical systems evolving over time cannot have algorithmic thermodynamic entropies that are in synch. We look at future work involving the Kolmogorov complexity of black holes.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Perspective on Spin-Lattice Density-Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently developed viewpoint on the fundamentals of density-functional theory for finite interacting spin-lattice systems that centers around the notion of degeneracy regions is presented. It allows for an entirely geometrical description of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and v-representability. The phenomena receive exemplification by an Anderson impurity model and other small-lattice examples. The case of adiabatic change and the time-dependent setting are examined as well.</description>

      <title>Brain functions emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the connectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped by the brain's structural organization. However, the theoretical principles explaining how this physical architecture governs its function remain elusive. Here, we propose an algebraic quantum mechanics (AQM) framework in which the functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system defined on the underlying directed multigraph. These equilibrium states, derived from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states formalism, capture the contribution of each neuron to the overall information flow. We apply this framework to the connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, providing a detailed description of the KMS states, exploring their functional implications, and predicting functional networks based on anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, our approach reveals functional circuits predicted by the topology of the connectome and illuminates on the mechanisms linking structure to function.</description>

      <title>Gravity from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Reality of the Eigenvalues of the Hilbert-P\'olya Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15135v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the recent work in~[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 235204 (2024)], we propose a Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture. We demonstrate the existence of a well-defined similarity transformation that renders this Hamiltonian self-adjoint for the nontrivial Riemann zeros. Specifically, we show that the eigenfunctions of the transformed operator are orthogonal and square-integrable, and crucially, that the eigenvalues are real. This represents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Wide-field microwave magnetic field imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive imaging of microwave (MW) magnetic fields with microscale lateral resolution is pivotal for various applications, such as MW technologies and integrated circuit failure analysis. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometry has emerged as an ideal tool, offering $\mu$m-scale resolution, millimeter-scale field of view, high sensitivity, and non-invasive imaging compatible with diverse samples. However, up until now, it has been predominantly used for imaging of static or low-frequency magnetic fields or, concerning MW field imaging, to directly characterize the same microwave device used to drive the NV spin transitions. In this work we leverage an NV center ensemble in diamond for wide-field imaging of MW magnetic fields generated by a test device employing a differential measurement protocol. The microscope is equipped with a MW loop to induce Rabi oscillations between NV spin states, and the MW field from the device-under-test is measured through local deviations in the Rabi frequency. This differential protocol yields magnetic field maps of a 2.57 GHz MW field with a sensitivity of $\sim$ 9 $\mu$T Hz$^{-1/2}$ for a total measurement duration of $T = 357$ s, covering a $340\times340$ $\mu$m$^2$ field of view with a $\mu$m-scale spatial resolution and a DUT input power dynamic range of 30 dB. This work demonstrates a novel NV magnetometry protocol, based on differential Rabi frequency measurement, that extends NV wide-field imaging capabilities to imaging of weak MW magnetic fields that would be difficult to measure directly through standard NV Rabi magnetometry.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). To tackle the problem cumbersome existent methods of eantanglement entropy calculation, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. Taking a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and show the high computation precision. In this simulation, the calculated scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy elucidates the different phases of the Fermi surface and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Extending the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies: new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing industrial relevance of quantum technologies (QTs), a new quantum workforce with special qualification will be needed. Building this workforce requires educational efforts, from short-term training to degree programs. In order to plan, map and compare such efforts, personal qualifications or job requirements, standardization is necessary. The European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) provides a common language for QT education. The 2024 update to version 2.5 extends it with the new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles: The proficiency triangle proposes six proficiency levels for three proficiency areas, specifying knowledge and skills for each level. Nine qualification profiles show prototypical qualifications or job roles relevant to the quantum industry with the required proficiency, examples, and suggestions. This is an important step towards the standardization of QT education. The CFQT update is based on the results of an analysis of 34 interviews on industry needs. The initial findings from the interviews were complemented by iterative refinement and expert consultation.</description>

      <title>Kinetic uncertainty relations for quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the precision of currents in a generic multi-terminal quantum-transport setting. Employing scattering theory, we show that the precision of the currents is limited by a function of the particle-current noise that can be interpreted as the activity in the classical limit. We thereby establish a kinetic uncertainty relation for quantum transport. In the full quantum limit, we find precision bounds in which we modify the activity constraints depending on whether the system is fermionic or bosonic. We expect these bounds to be guidelines for any transport process aiming at high precision.</description>
