      <title>Topological Floquet engineering of a three-band optical lattice with dual-mode resonant driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Floquet framework for controlling topological features of a one-dimensional optical lattice system with dual-mode resonant driving, in which both the amplitude and phase of the lattice potential are modulated simultaneously. We investigate a three-band model consisting of the three lowest orbitals and elucidate the formation of a cross-linked two-leg ladder through an indirect interband coupling via an off-resonant band. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of topologically nontrivial bands within the driven system, and a topological charge pumping phenomenon with cyclic parameter changes in the dual-mode resonant driving. Finally, we show that the band topology in the driven three-band system is protected by parity-time reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Imaging Spinor Bose Gasses Using Off-Axis Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, non-invasive imaging technique based on spin-dependent off-axis holography (SOAH) for spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Utilizing a dual reference beam strategy, this method records two orthogonal circular polarization components of a single probe beam. The circular birefringence of spin-polarized atoms induces differing complex phase shifts in the polarization components of the light, which are reconstructed from the interference patterns captured on camera. Our approach enables spin- and density-resolved imaging of both phase and amplitude information \emph{in-situ} on a sub-millisecond time scale with minimal disturbance to the condensate. We explore the technique's efficacy under various background static fields, demonstrating its sensitivity to the quantization axis of the atoms and confirming its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Interaction induced splitting of Dirac monopoles in the topological Thouless pumping of strongly interacting Bosons and SU($N$) Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of the breakdown of quantization for the Thouless pump in the presence of strong interaction by ETH [Walter et. al. Nat. Phys. 19, 1471 (2023), Viebahn et. al. arXiv:2308.03756], we study the interplay of strong interaction and topology in the (1+1)-dimensional interacting Rice-Mele model. We point out that the quantization of the interacting Thouless pump is dictated by the Chern number, i.e., the Dirac monopoles enclosed by the generalized Brillouin zone of the many-body wave function. By analyzing the change of location monopoles due to interaction, we predict the Thouless charge pump for strongly interacting Bose and SU($N$) Fermi gases in optical lattices and explain the ETH experiment.</description>

      <title>Three-body forces and Efimov physics in nuclei and atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review article presents historical developments and recent advances in our understanding on the three-body forces and Efimov physics, from an interdisciplinary viewpoint encompassing nuclear physics and cold atoms. Theoretical attempts to elucidate the three-body force with the chiral effective field theory are explained, followed by an overview of experiments aimed at observing signatures of the nuclear three-body force. Some recent experimental and theoretical works in the field of cold atoms devoted to measuring and engineering three-body forces among atoms are also presented. As a phenomenon arising from the three-body effect, Efimov physics in both cold atoms and nuclear systems is reviewed.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of many-body localization in bond-disordered spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) hinders the thermalization of quantum many-body systems in the presence of strong disorder. In this work, we study the MBL regime in bond-disordered spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain, finding the multimodal distribution of entanglement entropy in eigenstates, sub-Poissonian level statistics, and revealing a relation between operators and initial states required for examining the breakdown of thermalization in the time evolution of the system. We employ a real space renormalization group scheme to identify these phenomenological features of the MBL regime that extend beyond the standard picture of local integrals of motion relevant for systems with disorder coupled to on-site operators. Our results pave the way for experimental probing of MBL in bond-disordered spin chains.</description>

      <title>Many-body perturbation theory for strongly correlated effective Hamiltonians using effective field theory methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introducing low-energy effective Hamiltonians is usual to grasp most correlations in quantum many-body problems. For instance, such effective Hamiltonians can be treated at the mean-field level to reproduce some physical properties of interest. Employing effective Hamiltonians that contain many-body correlations renders the use of perturbative many-body techniques difficult because of the overcounting of correlations. In this work, we develop a strategy to apply an extension of the many-body perturbation theory starting from an effective interaction that contains correlations beyond the mean field level. The goal is to re-organize the many-body calculation to avoid the overcounting of correlations originating from the introduction of correlated effective Hamiltonians in the description. For this purpose, we generalize the formulation of the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory by including free parameters adjusted to reproduce the appropriate limits. In particular, the expansion in the bare weak-coupling regime and the strong-coupling limit serves as a valuable input to fix the value of the free parameters appearing in the resulting expression. This method avoids double counting of correlations using beyond-mean-field strategies for the description of many-body systems. The ground state energy of various systems relevant for ultracold atomic, nuclear, and condensed matter physics is reproduced qualitatively beyond the domain of validity of the standard many-body perturbation theory. Finally, our method suggests interpreting the formal results obtained as an effective field theory using the proposed reorganization of the many-body calculation. The results, like ground state energies, are improved systematically by considering higher orders in the extended many-body perturbation theory while maintaining a straightforward polynomial expansion.</description>

      <title>Swallow-tail dispersions of moving solitons in a two-dimensional fermionic superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soliton-like localised wave solutions in a two-dimensional Fermi superfluid are studied by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in the BCS regime of weak pairing interactions. The dispersion relations of these solitons are found to exhibit a peculiar swallow-tail shape, with cusps and multiple branches. The effective mass of the solitons is found to diverge and change sign at the cusp. This behavior is in contrast to the smooth dispersion relations and negative effective masses of solitons in the three-dimensional Fermi superfluid. The swallow-tail dispersion relations are shown to be a consequence of counterflow of the superfluid and sign-changing contributions to the superfluid current from different transverse momenta in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The results are relevant for the understanding of solitonic excitations in two-dimensional Fermi superfluids, such as ultracold atomic gases and high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Globally optimal interferometry with lossy twin Fock probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity or quadratic spin (e.g., $J_{z}^{2}$) readouts of a Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer probed with a twin Fock input state allow to saturate the optimal sensitivity attainable among all mode-separable states with a fixed total number of particles, but only when the interferometer phase $\theta$ is near zero. When more general Dicke state probes are used, the parity readout saturates the quantum Fisher information (QFI) at $\theta=0$, whereas better-than-standard quantum limit performance of the $J_{z}^{2}$ readout is restricted to an $o(\sqrt{N})$ occupation imbalance. We show that a method of moments readout of two quadratic spin observables $J_{z}^{2}$ and $J_{+}^{2}+J_{-}^{2}$ is globally optimal for Dicke state probes, i.e., the error saturates the QFI for all $\theta$. In the lossy setting, we derive the time-inhomogeneous Markov process describing the effect of particle loss on twin Fock states, showing that method of moments readout of four at-most-quadratic spin observables is sufficient for globally optimal estimation of $\theta$ when two or more particles are lost. The analysis culminates in a numerical calculation of the QFI matrix for distributed MZ interferometry on the four mode state $\vert {N\over 4},{N\over 4},{N\over 4},{N\over 4}\rangle$ and its lossy counterparts, showing that an advantage for estimation of any linear function of the local MZ phases $\theta_{1}$, $\theta_{2}$ (compared to independent probing of the MZ phases by two copies of $\vert {N\over 4},{N\over 4}\rangle$) appears when more than one particle is lost.</description>

      <title>Universal spectral moment theorem and its applications in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high sensitivity of the spectrum and wavefunctions to boundary conditions, termed the non-Hermitian skin effect, represents a fundamental aspect of non-Hermitian systems. While it endows non-Hermitian systems with unprecedented physical properties, it presents notable obstacles in grasping universal properties that are robust against microscopic details and boundary conditions. In this Letter, we introduce a pivotal theorem: in the thermodynamic limit, for any non-Hermitian systems with finite-range interactions, all spectral moments are invariant quantities, independent of boundary conditions, posing strong constraints on the spectrum. Utilizing this invariance, we propose a new criterion for bulk dynamical phases based on experimentally observable features and applicable to any dimensions and any boundary conditions. Based on this criterion, we define the bulk dispersive-to-proliferative phase transition, which is distinct from the real-to-complex spectral transition and contrary to traditional expectations. We verify these findings in 1D and 2D lattice models.</description>
