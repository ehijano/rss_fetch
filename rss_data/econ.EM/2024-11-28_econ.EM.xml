      <title>Ranking probabilistic forecasting models with different loss functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduced various statistical performance metrics, based on the pinball loss and the empirical coverage, for the ranking of probabilistic forecasting models. We tested the ability of the proposed metrics to determine the top performing forecasting model and investigated the use of which metric corresponds to the highest average per-trade profit in the out-of-sample period. Our findings show that for the considered trading strategy, ranking the forecasting models according to the coverage of quantile forecasts used in the trading hours exhibits a superior economic performance.</description>

      <title>When Is Heterogeneity Actionable for Personalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Targeting and personalization policies can be used to improve outcomes beyond the uniform policy that assigns the best performing treatment in an A/B test to everyone. Personalization relies on the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effects, yet, as we show in this paper, heterogeneity alone is not sufficient for personalization to be successful. We develop a statistical model to quantify "actionable heterogeneity," or the conditions when personalization is likely to outperform the best uniform policy. We show that actionable heterogeneity can be visualized as crossover interactions in outcomes across treatments and depends on three population-level parameters: within-treatment heterogeneity, cross-treatment correlation, and the variation in average responses. Our model can be used to predict the expected gain from personalization prior to running an experiment and also allows for sensitivity analysis, providing guidance on how changing treatments can affect the personalization gain. To validate our model, we apply five common personalization approaches to two large-scale field experiments with many interventions that encouraged flu vaccination. We find an 18% gain from personalization in one and a more modest 4% gain in the other, which is consistent with our model. Counterfactual analysis shows that this difference in the gains from personalization is driven by a drastic difference in within-treatment heterogeneity. However, reducing cross-treatment correlation holds a larger potential to further increase personalization gains. Our findings provide a framework for assessing the potential from personalization and offer practical recommendations for improving gains from targeting in multi-intervention settings.</description>

      <title>From interpretability to inference: an estimation framework for universal approximators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.04209v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for estimation and inference for the broad class of universal approximators. Estimation is based on the decomposition of model predictions into Shapley values. Inference relies on analyzing the bias and variance properties of individual Shapley components. We show that Shapley value estimation is asymptotically unbiased, and we introduce Shapley regressions as a tool to uncover the true data generating process from noisy data alone. The well-known case of the linear regression is the special case in our framework if the model is linear in parameters. We present theoretical, numerical, and empirical results for the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects as our guiding example.</description>
