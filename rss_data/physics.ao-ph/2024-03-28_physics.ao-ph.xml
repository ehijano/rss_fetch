      <title>Properties and baroclinic instability of stratified thermal upper-ocean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of, and perform a stability analysis of a baroclinic zonal current in, a thermal rotating shallow-water model, sometimes called \emph{Ripa's model}, featuring stratification for quasigeostrophic upper-ocean dynamics. The model has Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. In addition to Casimirs, the model supports integrals of motion that neither form the kernel of the bracket nor are related to explicit symmetries. The model sustains Rossby waves and a neutral model, whose spurious growth is prevented by a positive-definite integral, quadratic on the deviation from the motionless state. A baroclinic zonal jet with vertical curvature is found to be spectrally stable for specific configurations of the gradients of layer thickness, vertically averaged buoyancy, and buoyancy frequency. Only a subset of such states was found Lyapunov stable using the available integrals, except the newly reported ones, whose role in constraining stratified thermal flow remains elusive. The existence of Lyapunov-stable states enabled bounding the nonlinear growth of perturbations to spectrally unstable states. Our results do not support the generality of earlier numerical evidence on the suppression of submesoscale wave activity as a result of the inclusion of stratification in thermal shallow-water theory, which we supported with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Utility of ocean wave parameters for improving predictions of ambient noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is concerned with prediction of the "wind noise" component of ambient noise (AN) in the ocean. It builds on the seminal paper by Felizardo and Melville (1995), in which the authors quantified the correlation between AN and individual wind/wave parameters. Acoustic data are obtained from hydrophones deployed in the north and northeast Pacific Ocean, and wind/wave parameters are obtained from moored buoys and numerical models. We describe a procedure developed for this study which isolates the correlation of AN with wave parameters, independent of mutual correlation with wind speed (residual correlation). We then describe paired calibration/prediction experiments, whereby multiple wind/wave parameters are used simultaneously to estimate AN. We find that the improvement from inclusion of wave parameters is robust but modest. We interpret the latter outcome as suggesting that wave breaking responds to changes in local winds quickly, relative to, for example, total wave energy, which develops more slowly. This outcome is consistent with prior knowledge of the physics of wave breaking, e.g. Babanin (2011). We discuss this in context of the time/space response of various wave parameters to wind forcing.</description>

      <title>Global transformer overheating from geomagnetic storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetic storms occurring due to sustained, high-speed solar winds are known to induce currents in power distribution networks. These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause high voltage transformers (HVT) to overheat, thus resulting in a catastrophic electricity loss event (CELE). Since significant portions of infrastructures around the world rely heavily on access to electric power, it is essential to estimate the risks associated with GICs on a global scale. We assemble multiple methodologies across various scientific disciplines to develop a framework assessing the probability of a severe geomagnetic storm causing a long-term, widespread power outage. Our model incorporates thermal models of HVT tie bar hot spots, historical geoelectric field estimates, and a global conductivity model to estimate the risk of long-term power outage for regions between -70 degrees and 80 degrees geomagnetic latitude due to transformer overheating failure. Assuming a uniform 33% HVT spare capacity, our analysis indicates that a 1 in 10,000 year storm would result in approximately 1% of the population in Europe and North America experiencing a long-term (months to years) electricity loss.</description>
