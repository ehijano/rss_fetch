      <title>Supershear-subshear-supershear rupture sequence during the 2025 Mandalay Earthquake in Myanmar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the rupture dynamics of the 2025 $M_w$7.7 Mandalay, Myanmar earthquake, using a video recording of surface rupture, strong motion recordings, waveform simulation, and satellite imagery. Our assessment, based on the S-wave observation in the video and rupture arrival time at a seismic station 246 km south of the hypocenter, suggests that rupture decelerated to subshear speeds ($\sim$3 km/s) from initial supershear propagation ($\sim$6 km/s) before reaching the camera location. This deceleration is also supported by comparison between the fault-normal acceleration patterns seen in the video and that simulated by kinematic rupture modeling. Additionally, satellite imagery indicated a local minimum in slip (2$-$3 m) approximately 40$-$60 km south of the epicenter, suggesting a region of reduced stress drop that likely caused the temporary deceleration. Beyond this point, the rupture appears to have re-established supershear propagation.</description>

      <title>Deep learning forecasts the spatiotemporal evolution of fluid-induced microearthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14923</link>

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves $R^2 &gt;0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 &gt;0.88$ for the 15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.</description>

      <title>Observations of high-frequency spectral peaks from in-situ waves in ice data: evidence for nonlinear waves in ice triad interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of waves through the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and deeper into pack ice is a key phenomenon that influences the breakup and drift of sea ice. When waves in ice propagate through a solid, non-cracked, thick enough sea ice cover, significant flexural elastic effects can be present in the dispersion relation. This results in a dispersion relation that opens up for 3-wave interactions, also known as wave triads.
  Here, we report the observation of high-frequency spectral peaks in the power spectral density of waves in ice spectra. We show, in two timeseries datasets, that the presence of these high-frequency peaks is accompanied by high values for the spectral bicoherence. This is a signature that the high-frequency peak is phase-locked with frequency components in the main spectral energy peak, and a necessary condition for nonlinear coupling to take place. Moreover, we show for a timeseries dataset that includes several closely located sensors that the dispersion relation recovered from a cross-spectrum analysis is compatible with the possible existence of wave triads at the same frequencies for which the bicoherence peak is observed. In addition to these observations in timeseries datasets, we show that similar high-frequency peaks are observed from additional, independent datasets of waves in ice power spectrum densities transmitted over iridium from autonomous buoys.
  These results suggest that nonlinear energy transfers between wave in ice spectral components are likely to occur in some waves and sea ice conditions. This may enable redistribution of energy from weakly damped low-frequency waves to more strongly attenuated higher-frequency spectral components, which can contribute to energy dissipation in the ice.</description>
