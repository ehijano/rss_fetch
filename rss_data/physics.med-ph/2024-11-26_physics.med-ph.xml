      <title>Influence of applied stress on energy dissipation and crack growth in articular cartilage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical stress-induced damage to the articular cartilage can result in fracture imitation or significant tissue degeneration leading to osteoarthritis (OA) compromising joint mobility. Despite the clinical significance, a comprehensive understanding of the crack progression in cartilage damage remains elusive due to complex mechanical responses and variable initial crack geometry. This study investigated the impact of physiologically relevant stress levels, ranging from light-weight to high stress activities, on crack propagation in cartilage under compressive cyclic loading. Through empirical analysis, interconnections between localized damage (crack growth) and global damage (changes in material properties) across various levels of applied stress were established. Microscale cracks were nucleated in cylindrical cartilage plugs extracted from porcine patella specimens via microindentation and then subjected to controlled cyclic loading to examine changes in structural integrity, mechanical properties, and crack extension. Results demonstrated a decrease in cartilage thickness and apparent stiffness with increasing stress levels, indicative of bulk material damage. Dynamic mechanical properties such as energy dissipation and phase angle showed an overall reduction after fatigue loading. Crack growth followed an empirical law with increasing applied stress, reflective of greater mechanical damage at higher stress values. The findings of the study showed the interplay between global and local damage in cartilage under cyclic loading, suggesting insights into the fundamental changes occurring within the tissue. The outcomes of this investigation contributed to detailed understanding of the cartilage fatigue behavior through empirical laws and could potentially serve to prevent or delay tissue degeneration in OA.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Automatic Delineation of Liver Domes in kV Triggered Images for Online Breath-hold Reproducibility Verification of Liver Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can be a precise, minimally invasive treatment method for liver cancer and liver metastases. However, the effectiveness of SBRT relies on the accurate delivery of the dose to the tumor while sparing healthy tissue. Challenges persist in ensuring breath-hold reproducibility, with current methods often requiring manual verification of liver dome positions from kV-triggered images. To address this, we propose a proof-of-principle study of a deep learning-based pipeline to automatically delineate the liver dome from kV-planar images. From 24 patients who received SBRT for liver cancer or metastasis inside liver, 711 KV-triggered images acquired for online breath-hold verification were included in the current study. We developed a pipeline comprising a trained U-Net for automatic liver dome region segmentation from the triggered images followed by extraction of the liver dome via thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations. The performance and generalizability of the pipeline was evaluated using 2-fold cross validation. The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation took under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any triggered image took less than one second. The RMSE and rate of detection for Fold1 with 366 images was (6.4 +/- 1.6) mm and 91.7%, respectively. For Fold2 with 345 images, the RMSE and rate of detection was (7.7 +/- 2.3) mm and 76.3% respectively.</description>

      <title>Effects of Muscle Synergy during Overhead Work with a Passive Shoulder Exoskeleton: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Shoulder exoskeletons can effectively assist with overhead work. However, their impacts on muscle synergy remain unclear. The objective is to systematically investigate the effects of the shoulder exoskeleton on muscle synergies during overhead work.Methods: Eight male participants were recruited to perform a screwing task both with (Intervention) and without (Normal) the exoskeleton. Eight muscles were monitored and muscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization and electromyographic topographic maps. Results: The number of synergies extracted was the same (n = 2) in both conditions. Specifically, the first synergies in both conditions were identical, with the highest weight of AD and MD; while the second synergies were different between conditions, with highest weight of PM and MD, respectively. As for the first synergy in the Intervention condition, the activation profile significantly decreased, and the average recruitment level and activation duration were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05). The regression analysis for the muscle synergies across conditions shows the changes of muscle synergies did not influence the sparseness of muscle synergies (p=0.7341). In the topographic maps, the mean value exhibited a significant decrease (p&lt;0.001) and the entropy significantly increased (p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: The exoskeleton does not alter the number of synergies and existing major synergies but may induce new synergies. It can also significantly decrease neural activation and may influence the heterogeneity of the distribution of monitored muscle activations. Significance: This study provides insights into the potential mechanisms of exoskeleton-assisted overhead work and guidance on improving the performance of exoskeletons.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic Bioelectrical Impedance Drug Delivery Device for Patients with Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhalers with corticosteroids and muscle relaxants are prescribed by pulmonologists to mitigate bronchospasms that happen due to tightening of the chest. An adhesive patch attached to a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can relieve episodes of bronchospasms in the event the prescribed inhaler is not nearby. This paper shows the design and programming created to manufacture such a device. Methods: Electrical components were connected to a 3D model created in AutoCAD Fusion 360 in the order of inches. The model was imported, and simulation tests were evaluated in COMSOL Multiphysics. The device was 3D printed in the Makerspace at Hofstra University and tested for functionality. Results: The proposed design is a macromodel prototype of the micromodel adhesive patch that will attach above the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle on one side of the neck and be created in a microelectronics laboratory. Conclusion: The designed bioelectrical impedance device can detect severe muscle contractions related to the tensing and thickening of the SCM to deliver muscle relaxants to relieve acute exacerbations in patients with COPD. Significance: With this microfluidic drug delivery device even if the patient has forgotten to carry their inhaler, they are able to be relieved of the suffocating bronchospasm episode quickly and inhale their prescribed medication.</description>

      <title>Label-Free Intraoperative Mean-Transition-Time Image Generation Using Statistical Gating and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is of paramount importance to visualize blood dynamics intraoperatively, as this enables the accurate diagnosis of intraoperative conditions and facilitates informed surgical decision-making. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging represents the gold standard for the assessment of blood flow and the identification of vascular structures. However, it has several disadvantages, including time-consuming data acquisition, mandatory waiting periods, potential allergic reactions, and complex operations. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) provides an alternative for label-free assessment of blood flow; however, it lacks the necessary information for distinguishing arteries from veins and determining blood flow direction. Such information may be inferred from a Mean Transition Time (MTT) image derived from fluorescence imaging. In order to address these challenges, we propose the implementation of a Mixed Attention Dense UNet (MA-DenseUNet), which will be used to generate synthetic MTT images based on statistically gated deep tissue contrast and white light images. The proposed method provides clear delineation of vasculature, differentiation of arteries and veins, decoding of blood flow direction, and a reduction in imaging time by a minimum of 97.69%. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to optimize intraoperative optical imaging techniques, thereby providing faster and more efficient label-free surgical guidance.</description>

      <title>Interplay-robust optimization for treating irregularly breathing lung patients with pencil beam scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steep dose gradients obtained with pencil beam scanning allow for precise tumor targeting at the cost of high sensitivity to uncertainties. Robust optimization is commonly applied to mitigate uncertainties in density and patient setup, while its application to motion management, called 4D-robust optimization (4DRO), is typically accompanied by other motion mitigation techniques. In particular, current commercial implementations of 4DRO do not model the interplay effect between the delivery time structure and the patient's motion. Previously, it has been shown that Interplay-robust optimization (IPRO) can mitigate the interplay effect given uncertainty in the patient's breathing frequency. In this study, we investigate and evaluate IPRO in the context where the motion uncertainty is extended to also include variations in breathing amplitude. We model the patients' motion using synthetic 4DCTs, each created by deforming a reference CT based on a motion pattern obtained with 4DMRI. Each synthetic 4DCT contains multiple breathing cycles, partitioned into two sets for scenario generation: one for optimization and one for evaluation. Motion scenarios are then created by randomly concatenating breathing cycles varying in period and amplitude. In addition, a method considering a single breathing cycle for generating optimization scenarios (IPRO-1C) is developed to investigate to which extent robustness can be achieved with limited information. IPRO and IPRO-1C increased the target coverage for all patient cases in terms of the near-worst-case (5th percentile) CTV D98, compared to 4DRO. After normalization of plan doses to equal target coverage, IPRO with 49 scenarios resulted in the greatest decreases in OAR dose, with near-worst-case (95th percentile) improvements averaging 4.2 %. IPRO-1C with 9 scenarios, with comparable computational demands as 4DRO, decreased OAR dose by 1.7 %.</description>

      <title>Oriented histogram-based vector field embedding for characterizing 4D CT data sets in radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In lung radiotherapy, the primary objective is to optimize treatment outcomes by minimizing exposure to healthy tissues while delivering the prescribed dose to the target volume. The challenge lies in accounting for lung tissue motion due to breathing, which impacts precise treatment alignment. To address this, the paper proposes a prospective approach that relies solely on pre-treatment information, such as planning CT scans and derived data like vector fields from deformable image registration. This data is compared to analogous patient data to tailor treatment strategies, i.e., to be able to review treatment parameters and success for similar patients. To allow for such a comparison, an embedding and clustering strategy of prospective patient data is needed. Therefore, the main focus of this study lies on reducing the dimensionality of deformable registration-based vector fields by employing a voxel-wise spherical coordinate transformation and a low-dimensional 2D oriented histogram representation. Afterwards, a fully unsupervised UMAP embedding of the encoded vector fields (i.e., patient-specific motion information) becomes applicable. The functionality of the proposed method is demonstrated with 71 in-house acquired 4D CT data sets and 33 external 4D CT data sets. A comprehensive analysis of the patient clusters is conducted, focusing on the similarity of breathing patterns of clustered patients. The proposed general approach of reducing the dimensionality of registration vector fields by encoding the inherent information into oriented histograms is, however, applicable to other tasks.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Perfusion Reconstruction with Time Separation Technique in Cone-Beam CT Dynamic Liver Perfusion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of embolisation, a minimally invasive treatment of liver cancer, could be evaluated in the operational room with cone-beam CT by acquiring a dynamic perfusion scan. The reconstruction algorithm must address the issues of low temporal sampling and higher noise levels inherent in cone-beam CT systems, compared to conventional CT. Therefore, a model-based perfusion reconstruction based on the time separation technique (TST) was applied. TST uses basis functions to model time attenuation curves. These functions are either analytical or based on prior knowledge, extracted using singular value decomposition from CT perfusion data. To explore how well the prior knowledge can model perfusion dynamics and what the potential limitations are, the dynamic CBCT perfusion scan was simulated under different noise levels. The TST method was compared to static reconstruction. It was demonstrated that a set consisting of only four basis functions results in perfusion maps that preserve relevant information, denoises the data, and outperforms static reconstruction under higher noise levels. TST with prior knowledge would not only outperform static reconstruction, but also the TST with analytical basis functions. Furthermore, it has been shown that only eight CBCT rotations, unlike previously assumed ten, are sufficient to obtain the perfusion maps comparable to the reference CT perfusion maps. This contributes to saving dose and reconstruction time. The real dynamic CBCT perfusion scan, reconstructed under the same conditions as the simulated scan, shows potential for maintaining the accuracy of the perfusion maps. By visual inspection, the embolised region was matching to that in corresponding CT perfusion maps. Further analysis of a larger cohort of patient data is needed to draw final conclusions regarding the expected advantages of the time separation technique.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Healthcare Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Healthcare materials, whether they are natural or synthetic, are complex structures made up of simpler materials. Because of their intricate structure, composite materials are ideal for prosthetics because it is possible to tune their structure to get mechanical properties that are compatible with bone, thus encouraging biointegration. To be effective, implants must be properly suited to the host, which necessitates complete control over both the design of the implants as well as their evolution over time as they are used. In the case of composite implants, this means that, while material control at the macroscopic scale is required during implant shaping, the quality of the interface, which is determined by phenomena acting at the nanoscale, is also required. In this work, we show that such an issue can be resolved by resorting to a multi-scale approach and that, in this context, numerical modeling is a useful tool. Then we describe the principle of the process for investigating composite biomaterials using numerical modeling. Then, we give a concrete example of the protocol by talking about the first step of the ''grafting from'' method that Professors H. Palkowski and A. Carrado's teams came up with to make implants from hybrid biomaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DC-SRF-II gun, a high-brightness continuous-wave photocathode gun, has greater potential in electron beam irradiation applications. This paper presents the in-vacuum and in-air irradiation dosimetry study of the high repetition rate electron beam from the DC-SRF-II gun with both Monte Carlo simulations and experiments. Especially, high-dose uniform irradiations with flexible and accurate tuning of dose rate across orders of magnitude are demonstrated. Good stability and repeatability of the doses are also shown. The ultra-wide tuning range and precise control of irradiation time and dose rate are expected to pave the way for innovative applications across a wide range of fields.</description>

      <title>ADOBI: Adaptive Diffusion Bridge For Blind Inverse Problems with Application to MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion bridges (DB) have emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion models for imaging inverse problems, achieving faster sampling by directly bridging low- and high-quality image distributions. While incorporating measurement consistency has been shown to improve performance, existing DB methods fail to maintain this consistency in blind inverse problems, where the forward model is unknown. To address this limitation, we introduce ADOBI (Adaptive Diffusion Bridge for Inverse Problems), a novel framework that adaptively calibrates the unknown forward model to enforce measurement consistency throughout sampling iterations. Our adaptation strategy allows ADOBI to achieve high-quality parallel magnetic resonance imaging (PMRI) reconstruction in only 5-10 steps. Our numerical results show that ADOBI consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, and further advances the Pareto frontier for the perception-distortion trade-off.</description>

      <title>Coherence Based Sound Speed Aberration Correction -- with clinical validation in obstetric ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to demonstrate a robust and clinically validated method for correcting sound speed aberrations in medical ultrasound. We propose a correction method that calculates focusing delays directly from the observed two-way distributed average sound speed. The method beamforms multiple coherence images and selects the sound speed that maximizes the coherence for each image pixel. The main contribution of this work is the direct estimation of aberration, without the ill-posed inversion of a local sound speed map, and the proposed processing of coherence images which adapts to in vivo situations where low coherent regions and off-axis scattering represents a challenge. The method is validated in vitro and in silico showing high correlation with ground truth speed of sound maps. Further, the method is clinically validated by being applied to channel data recorded from 172 obstetric Bmode images, and 12 case examples are presented and discussed in detail. The data is recorded with a GE HealthCare Voluson Expert 22 system with an eM6c matrix array probe. The images are evaluated by three expert clinicians, and the results show that the corrected images are preferred or gave equivalent quality to no correction (1540m/s) for 72.5% of the 172 images. In addition, a sharpness metric from digital photography is used to quantify image quality improvement. The increase in sharpness and the change in average sound speed are shown to be linearly correlated with a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.67.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), typically due to intracranial aneurysms, demands precise imaging for effective treatment. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), despite being the gold standard, broadly visualizes cerebral blood flow, potentially masking key details in areas. This study introduces an approach integrating a 3D vascular atlas with 2D DSA images to allow targeted quantitative analysis in these crucial regions, thus enhancing diagnostic accuracy during interventions. Initially, DSA data was examined to ascertain the injection site. Following this, the appropriate viewing angle was determined to align accurately with the 3D vascular atlas. Utilizing this atlas, regions corresponding to the areas indicated as perfused were selected. Concurrently, a mask representing the perfused areas was created from the DSA sequence. This mask facilitated the initial coarse alignment of the projected 3D atlas to the DSA perfused territory deformable registration techniques, ensuring a precise overlay with the DSAs perfused territories. The performance of each overlay was measured using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). The coregistration process revealed that deformable registrations was essential to achieve precise overlays of the 3D atlas projections with the 2D DSA perfused areas. This approach enabled the extraction of targeted quantitative angiography parameters, essential for detailed vascular assessment in subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. The integration of 3D atlas registration with 2D DSA projections facilitates a more precise and targeted diagnostic process for SAH during critical interventions. This image processing strategy enhances the visualization of affected arterial territories, potentially improving the accuracy of diagnostics and supporting better informed clinical decisions at the time of intervention</description>

      <title>Diffuse optical tomography in time domain with the inverse Rytov series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rytov approximation has been commonly used to obtain reconstructed images for optical tomography. However, the method requires linearization of the nonlinear inverse problem. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear Rytov approximations by developing the inverse Rytov series for the time-dependent diffusion equation. The method is verified by a solid-phantom experiment.</description>

      <title>Magnetization transfer explains most of the $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To identify the predominant source of the $T_1$ variability described in the literature, which ranges from 0.6-1.1 s for brain white matter at 3 T.
  Methods: 25 $T_1$-mapping methods from the literature were simulated with a mono-exponential and various magnetization-transfer (MT) models, each followed by mono-exponential fitting. A single set of model parameters was assumed for the simulation of all methods, and these parameters were estimated by fitting the simulation based to the corresponding literature $T_1$ values of white matter at 3 T. In vivo MT parameter maps were further used to synthesize MR images for 3 $T_1$-mapping methods. A mono-exponential model was fitted to the synthesized and corresponding experimental MR images.
  Results: Mono-exponential simulations suggest good inter-method reproducibility and fail to explain the highly variable $T_1$ estimates in the literature. In contrast, MT simulations suggest that a mono-exponential fit results in a variable $T_1$ and explain up to 62% of the literature's variability. In our own in vivo experiments, MT explains 70% of the observed variability.
  Conclusion: The results suggest that a mono-exponential model does not adequately describe longitudinal relaxation in biological tissue. Therefore, $T_1$ in biological tissue should be considered only a semi-quantitative metric that is inherently contingent upon the imaging methodology; and comparisons between different $T_1$-mapping methods and the use of simplistic spin systems - such as doped-water phantoms - for validation should be viewed with caution.</description>

      <title>Cutting Voxel Projector a New Approach to Construct 3D Cone Beam CT Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel class of projectors for 3D cone beam tomographic reconstruction. Analytical formulas are derived to compute the relationship between the volume of a voxel projected onto a detector pixel and its contribution to the line integral of attenuation recorded by that pixel. Based on these formulas, we construct a near-exact projector and backprojector, particularly suited for algebraic reconstruction techniques and hierarchical reconstruction approaches with nonuniform voxel grids. Unlike traditional projectors, which assume a uniform grid with fixed voxel sizes, our method enables local refinement of voxels, allowing for adaptive grid resolution and improved reconstruction quality in regions of interest. We have implemented this cutting voxel projector along with a relaxed, speed-optimized version and compared them to two established projectors: a ray-tracing projector based on Siddon's algorithm and a TT footprint projector. Our results demonstrate that the cutting voxel projector achieves higher accuracy than the TT projector, especially for large cone beam angles. Furthermore, the relaxed version of the cutting voxel projector offers a significant speed advantage over current footprint projector implementations, while maintaining comparable accuracy. In contrast, Siddon's algorithm, when achieving similar accuracy, is considerably slower than the cutting voxel projector. All algorithms are implemented in an open-source framework for algebraic reconstruction using OpenCL and C++, optimized for efficient GPU computation.
