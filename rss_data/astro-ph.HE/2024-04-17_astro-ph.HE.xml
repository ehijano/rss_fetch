      <title>Late-time X-ray Observations of the Jetted Tidal Disruption Event AT2022cmc: The Relativistic Jet Shuts Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022cmc represents the fourth known example of a relativistic jet produced by the tidal disruption of a stray star providing a unique probe of the formation and evolution of relativistic jets in otherwise dormant supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Here we present deep, late-time Chandra observations of AT2022cmc extending to $t_{\rm obs} \approx 400$ days after disruption. Our observations reveal a sudden decrease in the X-ray brightness by a factor of $\gtrsim 14$ over a factor of $\approx 2.3$ in time, and a deviation from the earlier power-law decline with a steepening $\alpha \gtrsim 3.2$ ($F_X \propto t^{-\alpha}$), steeper than expected for a jet break, and pointing to the cessation of jet activity at $t_{\rm obs} \approx 215$ days. Such a transition has been observed in two previous TDEs (Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05). From the X-ray luminosity and the timescale of jet shutoff, we parameterize the mass of the SMBH in terms of unknown jet efficiency and accreted mass fraction parameters. Motivated by the disk-jet connection in AGN, we favor black hole masses $\lesssim 10^5 \ \rm M_{\odot}$ (where the jet and disk luminosities are comparable), and disfavor larger black holes (in which extremely powerful jets are required to outshine their accretion disks). We additionally estimate a total accreted mass of $\approx 0.1 \rm \ M_{\odot}$. Applying the same formalism to Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05, we favor comparable black hole masses for these TDEs of $\lesssim$ a few $\times 10^5 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, and suggest that jetted TDEs may preferentially form from lower mass black holes when compared to non-relativistic events, owing to generally lower jet and higher disk efficiencies at higher black hole masses.</description>

      <title>Classifying binary black holes from Population III stars with the Einstein Telescope: a machine-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers at redshifts up to $z\sim 100$. However, unequivocal determination of the origin of high-redshift sources will remain uncertain, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and poor estimate of their luminosity distance. This study proposes a machine learning approach to infer the origins of high-redshift BBHs, specifically differentiating those arising from Population III (Pop. III) stars - likely the first progenitors of stellar-born BBH mergers in the Universe - and those originated from Population I-II (Pop. I-II) stars. We have considered a wide range of state-of-the-art models encompassing current uncertainties on Pop. III BBH mergers. We then estimate parameter errors of detected sources with ET using the Fisher-information-matrix formalism, followed by classification using XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm based on decision trees. For a set of mock observed BBHs, we provide the probability that they belong to the Pop. III class while considering the parameter errors of each source. In our fiducial model, we accurately identify ~10% of detected BBHs originating from Pop. III stars with &gt; 90% precision. Our study demonstrates how machine learning enables to achieve some pivotal aspects of ET science case by exploring the origin of individual high-redshift GW observations. We set the basis for further studies, which will integrate additional simulated populations and account for population modeling uncertainties</description>

      <title>Tilted Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we review some of the interesting consequences that tilt between the spin axis of the black hole and angular momentum axis of the accretion disk can have on the dynamics, thermodynamics, and observational appearance of accreting systems, from precessing coronae and jets to standing nozzle shocks and quasi-periodic oscillations. We begin the chapter by examining some of the reasons tilted disks are interesting as well as present arguments for how ubiquitous they may be. We then review the existing simulation results in the literature, broadly dividing them into sections on thick disks, thin disks, and magnetically arrested disks (MADs). We finish by highlighting some of the phenomenology that is unique to tilted disk simulations and discuss how this may apply to observations.</description>

      <title>Testing the TDE Outflow Model for the Bipolar Sgr A Lobes at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sgr A lobes are a pair of 15-pc-sized bipolar bubbles with co-aligned major axes perpendicular to the Galactic plane found in X-ray and radio observations of the Galactic center (GC). Their elusive origin is a vital ingredient in understanding the ongoing high energy processes at the GC. Here we perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to explore the tidal disruption event (TDE) outflow model for the origin of the Sgr A lobes. By following the outflow evolution in the circumnuclear medium, we find that TDE outflows naturally produce bipolar lobes delimited by forward shocks, and the dense postshock shell contributes significantly to the lobe's X-ray emission. Our fiducial run reproduces the morphology, density, temperature, and X-ray surface brightness distribution of the observed Sgr A lobes reasonably well. The current lobe age is ~3300 yr. Our model further predicts that the uplifted wake flow breaks through the ejecta-induced shock front, producing a shock-enclosed head region which is relatively dim in X-rays compared to other lobe regions. Both the dim head region and the predicted limb-brightening feature of the lobes are slightly inconsistent with current X-ray observations, and may be used to further test our model with more sensitive future X-ray observations. While light narrow jets and massive wide winds from TDE events usually do not reproduce the observed oval-shaped morphology of the lobes, the TDE outflow in our fiducial run is massive and yet narrow. Whether it is a jet or wind remains uncertain and future simulations covering both the outflow acceleration region and its pc-scale evolution would be very helpful in determining whether the Sgr A lobes indeed originate from a pair of TDE jets or winds.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT XIV: On the high linearly polarized pulsar signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The S-shaped swing of the linear polarization position angle (PPA) observed in many pulsars can be interpreted by the rotating vector model (RVM). However, efforts to fit the RVM for a large sample of pulsars observed with the MeerKAT telescope as a part of the Thousand-Pulsar-Array (TPA) programme, only succeeded for about half the cases. High time-resolution studies suggest that the failed cases arise due to the presence of orthogonal polarization modes, or highly disordered distribution of PPA points. One such example is PSR~J1645-0317. Recently it has been shown that the RVM can be recovered in this pulsar by using only time samples which are greater than 80% linearly polarized. In this work we test this novel approach on the brightest 249 pulsars from the TPA sample, of which 177 yield sufficient highly polarized samples to be amenable to our method. Remarkably, only 9 of these pulsars (5%) now fail to fit the RVM as opposed to 59% from the original analysis. This result favours the paradigm that the underlying mechanism is coherent curvature radiation.</description>

      <title>Early-time gamma-ray constraints on cosmic-ray acceleration in the core-collapse SN 2023ixf with the Fermi Large Area Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While SNRs have been considered the most relevant Galactic CR accelerators for decades, CCSNe could accelerate particles during the earliest stages of their evolution and hence contribute to the CR energy budget in the Galaxy. Some SNRs have indeed been associated with TeV gamma-rays, yet proton acceleration efficiency during the early stages of an SN expansion remains mostly unconstrained. The multi-wavelength observation of SN 2023ixf, a Type II SN in the nearby galaxy M101, opens the possibility to constrain CR acceleration within a few days after the collapse of the RSG stellar progenitor. With this work, we intend to provide a phenomenological, quasi-model-independent constraint on the CR acceleration efficiency during this event at photon energies above 100 MeV. We performed a maximum-likelihood analysis of gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope up to one month after the SN explosion. We searched for high-energy emission from its expanding shock, and estimated the underlying hadronic CR energy reservoir assuming a power-law proton distribution consistent with standard diffusive shock acceleration. We do not find significant gamma-ray emission from SN 2023ixf. Nonetheless, our non-detection provides the first limit on the energy transferred to the population of hadronic CRs during the very early expansion of a CCSN. Under reasonable assumptions, our limits would imply a maximum efficiency on the CR acceleration of as low as 1%, which is inconsistent with the common estimate of 10% in generic SNe. However, this result is highly dependent on the assumed geometry of the circumstellar medium, and could be relaxed back to 10% by challenging spherical symmetry. A more sophisticated, inhomogeneous characterisation of the shock and the progenitor's environment is required before establishing whether or not Type II SNe are indeed efficient CR accelerators at early times.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of pulsar flux density distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the spectral properties of 886 pulsars across a wide frequency range from 20MHz to 343.5GHz, including a total of 86 millisecond pulsars. The majority of the pulsars exhibit power-law behavior in their spectra, although some exceptions are observed. Five different spectral models, namely simple power-law, broken power-law, low-frequency turn-over, high-frequency cut-off, and double turn-over, were employed to explore the spectral behaviors. The average spectral index for pulsars modeled with a simple power-law is found to be -1.64 +/-0.80, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, significant correlations between the spectral index and characteristic parameters are observed particularly in millisecond pulsars, while no strong correlation is observed in normal pulsars. Different models show variations in the most influential characteristic parameters associated with the spectral index, indicating diverse dominant radiation mechanisms in millisecond pulsars.Finally, this study identifies 22 pulsars of the Gigahertz-peaked Spectra (GPS) type for the first time based on the Akaike information criterion.</description>

      <title>Formation of GW230529 from Isolated Binary Evolution and Its Electromagnetic Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this {\em Letter}, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic signals. By adopting the `delayed' supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the inferred event rate densities of GW230529-like mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers, as well as the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Thus, we conclude that the recently-discovered mgBHNS merger, GW230529, can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the equation of states of AP4 and DD2, the probabilities that GW230529 can make tidal disruption are $12.8\%$ and $63.2\%$, respectively. If GW230529 is a disrupted event, the associated kilonova is predicted to have an apparent magnitude of $\sim23-24\,{\rm{mag}}$, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and LSST. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by $\gamma$-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. The detection of GW230529 confirms the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel, suggesting that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for $\sim60\%$ cosmological BHNS population, we find that $\gtrsim90\%$ disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability Analysis of Relativistic Magnetized Jets: The Minimalist Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minimalist approach to the linear stability problem in fluid dynamics is developed that ensures efficiency by utilizing only the essential elements required to find the eigenvalues for given boundary conditions. It is shown that the problem is equivalent to a single first-order ordinary differential equation, and that studying the argument of the unknown complex function in the eigenvalue space is sufficient to find the dispersion relation. The method is applied to a model for relativistic magnetized astrophysical jets.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the optical and radio counterpart to the fast X-ray transient EP240315a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are extragalactic bursts of soft X-rays first identified &gt;10 years ago. Since then, nearly 40 events have been discovered, although almost all of these have been recovered from archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data. To date, optical sky surveys and follow-up searches have not revealed any multi-wavelength counterparts. The Einstein Probe, launched in January 2024, has started surveying the sky in the soft X-ray regime (0.5-4 keV) and will rapidly increase the sample of FXTs discovered in real time. Here, we report the first discovery of both an optical and radio counterpart to an FXT, the fourth source publicly released by the Einstein Probe. We discovered a fast-fading optical transient within the 3 arcmin localisation radius of EP240315a with the all-sky optical survey ATLAS, and our follow-up Gemini spectrum provides a redshift, z=4.859+/-0.002. Furthermore, we uncovered a radio counterpart in the S-band (3.0 GHz) with the MeerKAT radio interferometer. The optical (rest-frame UV) and radio luminosities indicate the FXT most likely originates from either a long gamma-ray burst or a relativistic tidal disruption event. This may be a fortuitous early mission detection by the Einstein Probe or may signpost a mode of discovery for high-redshift, high-energy transients through soft X-ray surveys, combined with locating multi-wavelength counterparts.</description>

      <title>Observation of microquasars high-energy emission with INTEGRAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microquasars are Black Hole X-ray binaries (BHXB) which can eject material in the form of a bipolar jet, similarly to quasars, but at much smaller scales. Their high-energy emission comes from an accretion disk (~ 1 keV) and from a hot "corona" near the black hole that up-scatters photons from the disk in the hard X-ray domain (1--100 keV). A high-energy component above 150 keV has been detected in bright sources and its precise origin is still unknown: it could come either from Compton scattering of disk photons on coronal relativistic non-thermal electrons (a.k.a hybrid Comptonization), or from the synchrotron emission from the very base of the compact jet. The measurement of polarization above 150 keV can provide valuable insights into the processes at play as we expect higher polarization fraction due to synchrotron emission from the jets (up to 70 % with a very ordered magnetic field). We use the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope to measure the soft gamma-ray polarization of the Crab Nebula and the BHXB Swift J1727.8-1613.</description>

      <title>Can AI Understand Our Universe? Test of Fine-Tuning GPT by Astrophysical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT has been the most talked-about concept in recent months, captivating both professionals and the general public alike, and has sparked discussions about the changes that artificial intelligence (AI) will bring to the world. As physicists and astrophysicists, we are curious about if scientific data can be correctly analyzed by large language models (LLMs) and yield accurate physics. In this article, we fine-tune the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model by the astronomical data from the observations of galaxies, quasars, stars, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and the simulations of black holes (BHs), the fine-tuned model demonstrates its capability to classify astrophysical phenomena, distinguish between two types of GRBs, deduce the redshift of quasars, and estimate BH parameters. We regard this as a successful test, marking the LLM's proven efficacy in scientific research. With the ever-growing volume of multidisciplinary data and the advancement of AI technology, we look forward to the emergence of a more fundamental and comprehensive understanding of our universe. This article also shares some interesting thoughts on data collection and AI design. Using the approach of understanding the universe - looking outward at data and inward for fundamental building blocks - as a guideline, we propose a method of series expansion for AI, suggesting ways to train and control AI that is smarter than humans.</description>

      <title>Neutrino and Gamma-Ray Signatures of Inelastic Dark Matter Annihilating outside Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new inelastic dark matter search: neutron stars in dark matter-rich environments capture inelastic dark matter which, for interstate mass splittings between about $45 - 285 \ \rm MeV$, will annihilate away before becoming fully trapped inside the object. This means a sizable fraction of the dark matter particles can annihilate while being outside the neutron star, producing neutron star-focused gamma-rays and neutrinos. We analyze this effect for the first time and target the neutron star population in the Galactic Center, where the large dark matter and neutron star content makes this signal most significant. Depending on the assumed neutron star and dark matter distributions, we set constraints on the dark matter-nucleon inelastic cross-section using existing H.E.S.S. observations. We also forecast the sensitivity of upcoming gamma-ray and neutrino telescopes to this signal, which can reach inelastic cross-sections as low as $\sim 2 \times 10^{-47} \ \rm cm^2$.</description>

      <title>Deep JWST/NIRCam imaging of Supernova 1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST/NIRCam obtained high angular-resolution (0.05-0.1''), deep near-infrared 1--5 micron imaging of Supernova (SN) 1987A taken 35 years after the explosion. In the NIRCam images, we identify: 1) faint H2 crescents, which are emissions located between the ejecta and the equatorial ring, 2) a bar, which is a substructure of the ejecta, and 3) the bright 3-5 micron continuum emission exterior to the equatorial ring. The emission of the remnant in the NIRCam 1-2.3 micron images is mostly due to line emission, which is mostly emitted in the ejecta and in the hot spots within the equatorial ring. In contrast, the NIRCam 3-5 micron images are dominated by continuum emission. In the ejecta, the continuum is due to dust, obscuring the centre of the ejecta. In contrast, in the ring and exterior to the ring, synchrotron emission contributes a substantial fraction to the continuum.
  Dust emission contributes to the continuum at outer spots and diffuse emission exterior to the ring, but little within the ring. This shows that dust cooling and destruction time scales are shorter than the synchrotron cooling time scale, and the time scale of hydrogen recombination in the ring is even longer than the synchrotron cooling time scale.
  With the advent of high sensitivity and high angular resolution images provided by JWST/NIRCam, our observations of SN 1987A demonstrate that NIRCam opens up a window to study particle-acceleration and shock physics in unprecedented details, probed by near-infrared synchrotron emission, building a precise picture of how a SN evolves.</description>

      <title>The outflowing ionised gas of I Zw 1 observed by HST COS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the HST COS spectrum of IZw1 aiming to probe the absorbing medium associated with the active galactic nucleus (AGN). We fitted the emission spectrum and performed spectral analysis of the identified absorption features to derive the corresponding ionic column densities and covering fractions of the associated outflows. We employed photoionisation modelling to constrain the total column density and the ionisation parameter of four detected kinematic components. By investigating the implications of the results together with the observed kinematic properties of both emission and absorption features, we derived constraints on the structure and geometry of the absorbing medium in the AGN environment. We find and characterise absorption line systems from outflowing ionised gas in four distinct kinematic components, located at -60, -280, -1950, and -2900 km/s with respect to the source rest frame. While the two slower outflows are consistent with a full covering of the underlying radiation source, the well-constrained doublet line ratios of the faster two, higher column density, outflows suggest partial covering, with a covering fraction of C_f~0.4. The faster outflows show also line-locking in the NV doublet, a signature of acceleration via line absorption. This makes IZw1 possibly the closest object that shows evidence for hosting line-driven winds. The observed -1950 km/s absorption is likely due to the same gas as an X-ray warm absorber. Furthermore, the behaviour in UV and X-ray bands implies that this outflow has a clumpy structure. We find that the highly asymmetric broad emission lines in IZw1, indicative of a collimated, outflowing broad line region, are covered by the absorbing gas. Finally, the strongest UV--X-ray absorber may be connected to some of the blueshifted line emission, indicative of a more spatially extended structure of this ionised medium.</description>

      <title>Superradiant instability of area quantized Kerr black hole with discrete reflectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

      <title>A Dependable Distance Estimator to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black Hole Low Mass X-ray Binaries (BH-LMXBs) are excellent observational laboratories for studying many open questions in accretion physics. However, determining the physical properties of BH-LMXBs necessitates knowing their distances. With the increased discovery rate of BH-LMXBs, many canonical methods cannot produce accurate distance estimates at the desired pace. In this study, we develop a versatile statistical framework to obtain robust distance estimates soon after discovery. Our framework builds on previous methods where the soft spectral state and the soft-to-hard spectral state transitions, typically present in an outbursting BH-LMXB, are used to place constraints on mass and distance. We further develop the traditional framework by incorporating general relativistic corrections, accounting for spectral/physical parameter uncertainties, and employing assumptions grounded in current theoretical and observational knowledge. We tested our framework by analyzing a sample of 50 BH-LMXB sources using X-ray spectral data from the \swift/XRT, \maxi/GSC, and \rxte/PCA missions. By modeling their spectra, we applied our framework to 26 sources from the 50. Comparison of our estimated distances to previous distance estimates indicates that our findings are dependable and in agreement with the accurate estimates obtained through parallax and H\,{\sc i} absorption methods. Investigating the accuracy of our constraints, we have found that estimates obtained using both the soft and transition spectral information have a median uncertainty (1$\sigma$) of 20\%, while estimates obtained using only the soft spectral state spectrum have a median uncertainty (1$\sigma$) of around 50\%. Furthermore, we have found no instrument-specific biases.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few to ten hours from nearby galactic nuclei. The origin of QPEs is still unclear. In this work, we investigated the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) + accretion disk model, where the disk is formed from a previous tidal disruption event (TDE). In this EMRI+TDE disk model, the QPEs are the result of collisions between a TDE disk and a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) orbiting around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of EMRIs which are one of the primary targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. Taking GSN 069 as an example, we find the EMRI wherein is of low eccentricity ($e&lt;0.1$ at 3-$\sigma$ confidence level) and semi-major axis about $O(10^2)$ gravitational radii of the central SMBH, which is consistent with the prediction of the wet EMRI formation channel, while incompatible with alternatives.</description>

      <title>The Tarantula - Revealed by X-rays (T-ReX)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus) is the most important star-forming complex in the Local Group, offering a microscope on starburst astrophysics. At its heart lies the exceptionally rich young stellar cluster R136, containing the most massive stars known. Stellar winds and supernovae have carved 30 Dor into an amazing display of arcs, pillars, and bubbles. We present first results and advanced data processing products from the 2-Ms Chandra X-ray Visionary Project, "The Tarantula - Revealed by X-rays" (T-ReX). The 3615 point sources in the T-ReX catalog include massive stars, compact objects, binaries, bright pre-main-sequence stars and compact young stellar (sub)clusters in 30 Dor. After removing point sources and excluding the exceptionally bright supernova remnant N157B (30 Dor B), the global diffuse X-ray maps reveal hot plasma structures resolved at 1-10 pc scales, with an absorption-corrected total-band (0.5-7 keV) X-ray luminosity of $2.110\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Spatially-resolved spectral modeling provides evidence for emission lines enhanced by charge-exchange processes at the interfaces. We identify a candidate for the oldest X-ray pulsar detected to date in 30 Dor, PSR J0538-6902, inside a newly-resolved arctuate X-ray wind nebula, the Manta Ray. The long time baseline of T-ReX monitored dozens of massive stars, several showing periodic variability tied to binary orbital periods, and captured strong flares from at least three low-mass Galactic foreground stars.</description>

      <title>Probing for chiral $Z^\prime$ gauge boson through scattering measurement experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of tiny neutrino mass can not be explained within the framework of Standard Model (SM), we consider extra gauge extended scenarios in which tiny neutrino masses are generated through seesaw mechanism. These scenarios are equipped with beyond the standard model (BSM) neutral gauge boson called $Z^\prime$ in the general $U(1)_X$ symmetry which is a linear combination of $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_{B-L}$. In this case, left and right handed fermions interact differently with the $Z^\prime$. The $Z^\prime$ gives rise to different processes involving neutrino-nucleon, neutrino-electron, electron-nucleus and electron-muon scattering processes. By comparing with proton, electron beam-dump experiments data, recast data from searches for the long-lived and dark photon at BaBaR, LHCb and CMS experiments, the electron and muon $g-2$ data, and the data of the dilepton and dijet searches at the LEP experiment, we derive bounds on the gauge coupling and the corresponding gauge boson mass for different $U(1)_X$ charges and evaluate the prospective limits from the future beam-dump scenarios at DUNE, FASER(2) and ILC. We conclude that large parameter regions could be probed by scattering, beam-dump and collider experiments in future.</description>

      <title>Hunting Nonstandard Neutrino Interactions and Leptoquarks in Dark Matter Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next generation direct dark matter (DM) detection experiments will have unprecedented capabilities to explore coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) complementary to dedicated neutrino experiments. We demonstrate that future DM experiments can effectively probe nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) mediated by scalar fields in the scattering of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. We set first limits on $S_1$ leptoquark models that result in sizable $\mu-d$ and $\tau-d$ sector neutrino NSI CE$\nu$NS contributions using LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) data. As we show, near future DM experiments reaching $\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$ton-year exposure, such as argon-based ARGO and xenon-based DARWIN, can probe parameter space of leptoquarks beyond the reach of current and planned collider facilities. We also analyze for the first time prospects for testing NSI in lead-based detectors. We discuss the ability of leptoquarks in the parameter space of interest to also explain the neutrino masses and $(g-2)_\mu$ observations.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing coalescing binary neutron star sources with the IGWN, including LIGO-Aundha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LIGO-Aundha (A1), the Indian gravitational wave detector, is expected to join the IGWN and begin operations in the early 2030s. We study the impact of A1 on the accuracy of determining the direction of incoming transient signals from coalescing BNS sources with moderately high SNRs. It is conceivable that A1's sensitivity, effective bandwidth, and duty cycle will improve incrementally through multiple detector commissioning rounds to achieve the desired `LIGO-A+' design sensitivity. For this purpose, we examine A1 under two distinct noise PSDs. One mirrors the conditions during the O4 run of the LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors, simulating an early commissioning stage, while the other represents the A+ design sensitivity. We consider various duty cycles of A1 at the sensitivities mentioned above for a comprehensive analysis. We show that even at the O4 sensitivity with a modest $20\%$ duty cycle, A1's addition to the IGWN leads to a $15\%$ reduction in median sky-localization errors ($\Delta \Omega_{90\%}$) to $5.6$~sq.~deg. At its design sensitivity and $80\%$ duty cycle, this error shrinks further to $2.4$~sq.~deg, with 84\% sources localized within a nominal error box of $10$~sq.~deg! Even in the worst-case scenario, where signals are sub-threshold in A1, we demonstrate its critical role in reducing the localization uncertainties of the BNS source. Our results are obtained from a large Bayesian PE study using simulated signals injected in a heterogeneous network of detectors using the recently developed meshfree approximation aided rapid Bayesian inference pipeline. We consider a seismic cut-off frequency of 10 Hz for all the detectors. We also present hypothetical improvements in sky localization for a few GWTC-like events injected in real data and demonstrate A1's role in resolving the degeneracy between the luminosity distance and inclination angle parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An explicit realistic model featuring a supercooled phase transition, which allows us to explain the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays, is constructed. In this model the phase transition corresponds to radiative symmetry breaking (and mass generation) in a dark sector featuring a dark photon associated with the broken symmetry. The completion of the transition is ensured by a non-minimal coupling between gravity and the order parameter and fast reheating occurs thanks to a preheating phase. Finally, it is also shown that the model leads to primordial black hole production.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from SN 1181 hosting a white dwarf merger product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remnant of the historical supernova 1181 is claimed to be associated with a white dwarf merger remnant J005311. The supernova remnant (SNR) shock, and a termination shock expected to be formed by the intense wind of J005311, are potential sites for radio emission via synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. In this paper, we estimate the radio emission from these two shocks, and find the peak radio flux to be 0.1--10 mJy (at 0.01--1 GHz) in the outer SNR shock and 0.01--0.1 mJy (at 1--10 GHz) in the inner termination shock. We also search for radio emission from this source in the archival data of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey at 3 GHz, NRAO VLA Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz and the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey at 408 MHz, resulting in no significant detection. While targeted observations with higher sensitivity are desired, we particularly encourage those at higher frequency and angular resolution to probe the inner termination shock and its evolution.</description>

      <title>Combined Pre-Supernova Alert System with Kamland and Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preceding a core-collapse supernova, various processes produce an increasing amount of neutrinos of all flavors characterized by mounting energies from the interior of massive stars. Among them, the electron antineutrinos are potentially detectable by terrestrial neutrino experiments such as KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande via inverse beta decay interactions. Once these pre-supernova neutrinos are observed, an early warning of the upcoming core-collapse supernova can be provided. In light of this, KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande have been monitoring pre-supernova neutrinos since 2015 and 2021, respectively. Recently, we performed a joint study between KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande on pre-supernova neutrino detection. A pre-supernova alert system combining the KamLAND detector and the Super-Kamiokande detector is developed and put into operation, which can provide a supernova alert to the astrophysics community. Fully leveraging the complementary properties of these two detectors, the combined alert is expected to resolve a pre-supernova neutrino signal from a 15 M$_{\odot}$ star within 510 pc of the Earth, at a significance level corresponding to a false alarm rate of no more than 1 per century. For a Betelgeuse-like model with optimistic parameters, it can provide early warnings up to 12 hours in advance.</description>
