      <title>Nonlinear phase synchronization and the role of spacing in shell models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A shell model can be considered as a chain of triads, where each triad can be interpreted as a nonlinear oscillator that can be mapped to a spinning top. Investigating the relation between phase dynamics and intermittency in a such a chain of nonlinear oscillators, it is found that synchronization is linked to increased energy transfer. In particular, the results provide evidence that the observed systematic increase of intermittency, as the shell spacing is decreased, is associated with strong phase alignment among consecutive triadic phases, facilitating the energy cascade. It is shown that while the overall level of synchronization can be quantified using a Kuramoto order parameter for the global phase coherence in the inertial range, a local, weighted Kuramoto parameter can be used for the detection of burst-like events propagating across shells in the inertial range. This novel analysis reveals how partially phase-locked states are associated with the passage of extreme events of energy flux. Applying this method to helical shell models, reveals that for a particular class of helical interactions, a reduction in phase coherence correlates with suppression of intermittency. When inverse cascade scenarios are considered using two different shell models including a non local helical shell model, and a local standard shell model with a modified conservation law, it was shown that a particular phase organization is needed in order to sustain the inverse energy cascade. It was also observed that the PDFs of the triadic phases were peaked in accordance with the basic considerations of the form of the flux, which suggests that a triadic phase of \pi/2 and -\pi/2 maximizes the forward and the inverse energy cascades respectively.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics with Topological Origins for non-Hermitian Scattering Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex singularities and their speckle patterns in random superpositions of waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable, they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise annihilation. They have found application in optical, acoustic, elastic, and fluid wave fields, among others. We generalize the concept of singularity speckle patterns to arbitrary two dimensional parameter spaces and any complex scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering. In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities associated with complex zeros of the scattering matrix S. Some examples are Coherent Perfect Absorption (CPA), Reflectionless Scattering Modes (RSMs), Transmissionless Scattering Modes (TSMs), and S-matrix Exceptional Points (EPs). All scattering singularities empirically share a universal statistical property: the tail of the probability distribution function of a quantity that diverges only at a singularity has the form of a -3 power law. The heavy tail of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given singularity in a generic scattering system. We use these universal statistical results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space. Finally, we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space, which result in higher order singularities that have new applications. These higher order singularities are not topologically protected, and we do not find universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude that all results presented are found in all generic scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Triplet Interactions: Areal and Perimetric Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational and electromagnetic interactions are Hamiltonian systems with forces between pairs of particles. We propose an alternative: Hamiltonian dynamics with triplet interactions between point particles. Our system has a potential energy that depends on the shape of the triangle for each triplet. Similar multi-body forces occur in many physical systems, e.g., polarizable molecules, nucleon interactions, and colloids, but typically are combined with more conventional two-body forces. We focus on potentials that depend only on the triangle perimeter or on its area. The resulting forces point towards a center of the triangle, either the incenter or the orthocenter, respectively. For the planar case, the resulting system has six degrees of freedom but can be reduced to three since it conserves the total momentum and angular momentum. The dynamics often exhibits chaotic motion, but there are a number of special solutions, for example equilateral and isosceles triangles, and perturbations of these can lie on invariant tori. Numerical investigations of several examples show families of such regular trajectories as well as examples of chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic consensus transitions in bounded-confidence dynamics on unbiased networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hegselmann-Krause model of opinion dynamics on sparse, unbiased networks generated via Wilson's algorithm, unveiling how network connectivity and confidence bounds jointly determine collective behavior. By systematically exploring the parameter space spanned by the confidence level $\epsilon$ and the mean degree density $\mu$, we construct comprehensive phase diagrams that classify the emergent steady states into different degrees of fragmentation and consensus. We uncover a nonmonotonic re-entrant transition where increased connectivity can paradoxically suppress consensus, and show that full unanimity is unattainable at low connectivity due to structural isolation. Convergence times exhibit two distinct slowdowns: a finite-size, connectivity-dependent resonance near $\epsilon \sim 1/N$, and a critical peak associated with the established fragmentation-to-consensus transition. While the critical confidence threshold $\epsilon_c$ stabilizes near 0.2 for large system sizes, finite-size effects and sparse connectivity significantly alter the dynamics and phase boundaries in smaller populations. Our results offer new insights into the interplay between network topology and opinion dynamics, and highlight conditions under which increased connectivity may hinder, rather than promote, consensus.</description>

      <title>Martini 3 application for the design of bistable nanomachines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During our previous modeling using all-atom molecular dynamics, we have identified several foldamers whose nanoscale behavior resembles that of classic bistable machines, namely the Euler archs and Duffing oscillators. However, time limitations of the all-atom molecular dynamics prevent us from performing a full-scale investigation of long-time behavior and prompt us to develop a coarse-grained model. In this work, we summarize our recent research on developing such models using the most widely available method called Martini.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Data Assimilation in Turbulent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of Data-Assimilation (DA) within the multi-scale framework of a shell model of turbulence, with a focus on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The central objective is to understand how measuring mesoscales (i.e., inertial-range scales) enhances the prediction of both large-scale and small-scale intermittent variables, by systematically varying observation frequency and the set of measured scales. We demonstrate that measurements conducted at frequencies that exceed those of the observed scales enable full synchronization of larger scales, provided that at least two adjacent mesoscale are measured. In addition, we benchmark the EnKF against two standard DA methods, such as Nudging and Ensemble 4D-Var, showing its overall superior performance. Moreover, our results underscore the need for a tailored, scale-aware inflation technique to stabilize the assimilation process, preventing filter divergence and ensuring robust convergence.</description>

      <title>Ubiquity of Uncertainty in Neuron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that final-state uncertainty is ubiquitous in multistable systems of coupled neuronal maps, meaning that predicting whether one such system will eventually be chaotic or nonchaotic is often nearly impossible. We propose a "chance synchronization" mechanism that governs the emergence of unpredictability in neuron systems and support it by using basin classification, uncertainty exponent, and basin entropy techniques to analyze five simple discrete-time systems, each consisting of a different neuron model. Our results illustrate that uncertainty in neuron systems is not just a product of noise or high-dimensional complexity; it is also a fundamental property of low-dimensional, deterministic models, which has profound implications for understanding brain function, modeling cognition, and interpreting unpredictability in general multistable systems.</description>

      <title>Koopman analysis of CAT maps onto classical and quantum 2-tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study classical continuous automorphisms of the torus (CAT maps) from the viewpoint of the Koopman theory. We find analytical formulae for Koopman modes defined coherently on the whole of the torus, and their decompositions associated with the partition of the torus into ergodic components. The spectrum of the Koopman operator is studied in four cases of CAT maps: cyclic, quasi-cyclic, critical (transition from quasi-cyclic to chaotic behaviour) and chaotic. We generalise these results to quantum CAT maps defined onto a noncommutative torus (and on its dual space). Finally, we study usual quantum chaos indicators onto quantum CAT maps from the viewpoint of the Koopman picture. The analogy with the classical case suggests that couples of these indicators are in fact necessary to certify a quantum chaotic behaviour.</description>
