      <title>A comprehensive survey of the GEO-belt using simultaneous four-colour observations with STING</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colour light curves of resident space objects (RSOs) encapsulate distinctive features that can offer insights into an object's structure and design, making them an invaluable tool for classification and characterisation. We present the results of the first large systematic colour survey of the GEO belt in which we obtain full-night multi-colour light curves for 112 active geostationary objects between April and May 2023. Colour light curve maps were created to compare and contrast the colours between different satellites and bus configurations. We find that satellites with BSS-702 and STAR-2 buses can be effectively distinguished from the colour measurements on these maps, but comparing the average colour of individual satellites within given solar equatorial phase angle ranges shows that it is difficult to distinguish between bus configurations based on colour alone. We also find tentative evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between colour and time spent on orbit for the Eurostar-3000 class satellites, which is unseen behaviour within other bus configuration classes. The satellites in our sample exhibit `redder' colours than the Sun, which is in agreement with previous findings. We found common light curve features such as symmetrical colour changes as well as unique regions of short timescale glinting which are `bluer' than other regimes within the colour light curves. If these features are indeed seasonal, this would be a powerful characterisation tool. We are able to detect and resolve features in the light curve of the LDPE-3A satellite related to manoeuvres being performed. Finally, we measured the solar panel offsets of 54 satellites in our sample and found variation in the type of colour response. The majority of which did not exhibit any colour change across the solar panel glints compared to them shifting towards 'redder' or 'bluer' colours.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Time-Stepping in the Chaotic Gravitational Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many problems in astrophysics cover multiple orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal scales. While simulating systems that experience rapid changes in these conditions, it is essential to adapt the (time-) step size to capture the behavior of the system during those rapid changes and use a less accurate time step at other, less demanding, moments. We encounter three problems with traditional methods. Firstly, making such changes requires expert knowledge of the astrophysics as well as of the details of the numerical implementation. Secondly, some parameters that determine the time-step size are fixed throughout the simulation, which means that they do not adapt to the rapidly changing conditions of the problem. Lastly, we would like the choice of time-step size to balance accuracy and computation effort. We address these challenges with Reinforcement Learning by training it to select the time-step size dynamically. We use the integration of a system of three equal-mass bodies that move due to their mutual gravity as an example of its application. With our method, the selected integration parameter adapts to the specific requirements of the problem, both in terms of computation time and accuracy while eliminating the expert knowledge needed to set up these simulations. Our method produces results competitive to existing methods and improve the results found with the most commonly-used values of time-step parameter. This method can be applied to other integrators without further retraining. We show that this extrapolation works for variable time-step integrators but does not perform to the desired accuracy for fixed time-step integrators.</description>

      <title>Moving to ICSC: synergy between PNRR projects for more powerful Data Centers: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents the new enhancement to the Data Center named DC1 at the University of Naples {\em Federico II}. The ICSC funds at INFN have allowed to improve the power and cooling subsystems, while other funds from the PNRR (the STILES project\index{STILES Project}) and funds directly from the MUR have allowed to enhance the computing, storage and network equipments. All these resources are in addition to the IBiSCo cluster and equipments described earlier in this book, but all together, thanks to a strong synergy between projects, have leaded to a very powerful Data Center for scientific applications.</description>

      <title>The Sliding Flux Ramp Demodulation Algorithm with High Sampling Rate in Microwave SQUID Multiplexer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave SQUID Multiplexing (uMUX) is a widely used technique in the low temperature detectors community as it offers high capacity of reading out large scale Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) arrays. In this paper, we propose a Sliding Flux Ramp Demodulation (SFRD) algorithm for uMUX readout system. It can achieve a sampling rate in the order of MHz while maintaining a multiplexing ratio about one thousand. Advancing of this large array readout technique makes it possible to observe scientiffc objects with improved time resolution and event count rate. This will be highly helpful for TES calorimeters in X-ray applications, such as X-ray astrophysics missions.</description>

      <title>Electron-induced chemistry and sputtering of volatile species from amorphous and crystalline water ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron irradiation of water-rich ices plays a significant role in initiating the chemical and physical processes on the surface of airless icy bodies in radiation environments such as Europa and Enceladus, as well as on the Moon, comets, and asteroids interacting with the solar wind. The sputtering process by electrons and ions leads to chemical modification and outgassing of their icy surfaces and the subsequent formation of a tenuous atmosphere. Though electron-sputtering yields are known to be lower compared to ion-sputtering yields, one needs to also account for their differential fluxes. In our experiments, the electron-induced sputtering yields of all the gaseous species H2, O, OH, H2O, and O2 are investigated for electron energies lower than 2 keV in terms of partial pressure vs. time of irradiation. The effective averaged change in partial pressure of the desorbed species is converted to the number of sputtered atoms or molecules per second per cm2 from the ice, and then to the sputtering yields (number of species sputtered per electron). Our data agrees well with the previously reported data for the sputtering of O2 and H2O yield for the amorphous ice. We also find that crystalline ice shows significantly lower sputtering yields when compared to amorphous ice, in agreement with the observation of similar trends in the literature. Our work indicates that sputtering yields per keV of O, OH, O2, and H2O drop with increasing electron energy from 0.5 keV to 2 keV.</description>

      <title>Preparing for the 2061 return of Halley's comet -- A rendezvous mission with an innovative imaging system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The return of Comet 1P/Halley will promote a wide interest for ground and space observations of a celestial body of outstanding scientific and cultural interest. In addition to remote observations, space will open the possibility of in situ science similarly to the passage of 1986. In this paper, we first discuss the scientific motivations for a rendezvous mission, capable to overcome the limitations of the flyby missions that took place at that time. In the second part, we describe an example of a rendezvous trajectory that can be carried out with existing power and propulsion technologies. The transfer is made possible by the gravitational assistance of a giant planet. The resulting mission will be capable to reach the comet beyond the distance of Saturn, when the sublimation of super-volatile species will be ongoing, and well before the onset of the sublimation of water (4 AU). After rendezvous, the spacecraft will accompany the comet for several years before, around and after perihelion (July 2061). Our concept mission does not foresee the implementation of solar panels. In this way, operations can occur even inside the dense dust coma at short distance from the nucleus. In the third part of the paper, an innovative imaging system is proposed, with a very large field of view (100{\deg}) capable to record on the same frame details on the surface and the surrounding space, in order to follow for several degrees the trajectories of chunks and clouds ejected by pits or fractures, crucial to the understanding of the cometary activity. A concerted effort is needed in the current decade to plan and approve a rendezvous mission to 1P. Indeed, the scenario here described requires launching before 2040, less than 15 years from now. Later launches imply a severe loss of scientific knowledge, because the spacecraft will not be able to reach the comet before the onset of water sublimation.</description>

      <title>Testing and Combining Transient Spectral Classification Tools on 4MOST-like Blended Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) expected to provide an influx of transient spectra when it begins observations in early 2026 we consider the potential for real-time classification of these spectra. We investigate three extant spectroscopic transient classifiers: the Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier (DASH), Next Generation SuperFit (NGSF) and SuperNova IDentification (SNID), with a focus on comparing the efficiency and purity of the transient samples they produce. We discuss our method for simulating realistic, 4MOST-like, host-galaxy contaminated spectra and determining quality cuts for each classifier used to ensure pure SN Ia samples while maintaining efficient classification in other transient classes. We investigate the classifiers individually and in combinations. We find that a combination of DASH and NGSF can produce a SN Ia sample with a purity of 99.9% while successfully classifying 70% of SNe Ia. However, it struggles to classify non-SN Ia transients. We investigate photometric cuts to transient magnitude and transient flux fraction, finding that both can be used to improve transient classification efficiencies by 7--25% depending on the transient subclass. Finally, we present an example classification plan for live classification and the predicted purities and efficiencies across five transient classes: Ia, Ibc, II, superluminous and non-supernova transients.</description>

      <title>Light Streak Photometry and Streaktools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of photometric calibration has gradually become a limiting factor in various fields of astronomy, limiting the scientific output of a host of research. Calibration using artificial light sources in low Earth orbit remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that photometric calibration using light sources in low Earth orbit is a viable and competitive alternative/complement to current calibration techniques, and explore the associated ideas and basic theory. We present the publicly available Python code Streaktools as a means to simulate and perform photometric calibration using real and simulated light streaks. Using Streaktools, we perform "pill" aperture photometry on 131 simulated streaks, and Markov chain Monte Carlo based point-spread-function (PSF) model-fitting photometry on 425 simulated streaks in an attempt to recover the magnitude zeropoint of a real exposure of the Dark Energy Camera instrument on the Blanco 4 m telescope. Our results show that calibration using pill photometry is too inaccurate to be useful, but that PSF photometry is able to produce unbiased and accurate (1{\sigma} error = 3.4 mmag) estimates of the zeropoint of a real image in a realistic scenario, with a reasonable light source. This demonstrates that light-streak photometry is a promising alternative and complement to established techniques, which should be explored and tested further.</description>

Abstract: Radio antennas are widely used in the field of particle astrophysics in searches for ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and neutrinos (UHEN). It is therefore necessary to properly describe the physics of their response. In this article, we summarize the mathematics underlying parameterizations of radio antennas. As a paradigm, we focus on a half-wave dipole and also discuss measurements of characteristics, performed in an electromagnetic (EM) anechoic chamber.</description>

      <title>Bayesian distances for quantifying tensions in cosmological inference and the surprise statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensions between cosmological parameters derived through different channels can be a genuine signature of new physics that $\Lambda$CDM as the standard model is not able to reproduce, in particular in the missing consistency between parameter estimates from measurements the early and late Universe. Or, they could be caused by yet to be understood systematics in the measurements as a more mundane explanation. Commonly, cosmological tensions are stated in terms of mismatches of the posterior parameter distributions, often assuming Gaussian statistics. More importantly, though, would be a quantification if two data sets are consistent to each other before combining them into a joint measurement, ideally isolating hints at individual data points that have a strong influence in generating the tension. For this purpose, we start with statistical divergences applied to posterior distributions following from different data sets and develop the theory of a Fisher metric between two data sets, in analogy to the Fisher metric for different parameter choices. As a topical example, we consider the tension in the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ from supernova and measurements of the cosmic microwave background, derive a ranking of data points in order of their influence on the tension on $H_0$. For this particular example, we compute Bayesian distance measures and show that in the light of CMB data, supernovae are commonly too bright, whereas the low-$\ell$ CMB spectrum is too high, in agreement with intuition about the parameter sensitivity.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler: Transit Classification and Vetting Catalog for 2-min Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalogs containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.</description>
