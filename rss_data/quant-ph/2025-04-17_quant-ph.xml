      <title>Universal work extraction in quantum thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the maximum amount of work extractable from a nanoscale quantum system is one of the central problems in quantum thermodynamics. Previous works identified the free energy of the input state as the optimal rate of extractable work under the crucial assumption: experimenters know the description of the given quantum state, which restricts the applicability to significantly limited settings. Here, we show that this optimal extractable work can be achieved without knowing the input states at all, removing the aforementioned fundamental operational restrictions. We achieve this by presenting a universal work extraction protocol, whose description does not depend on input states but nevertheless extracts work quantified by the free energy of the unknown input state. Remarkably, our result partially encompasses the case of infinite-dimensional systems, for which optimal extractable work has not been known even for the standard state-aware setting. Our results clarify that, in spite of the crucial difference between the state-aware and state-agnostic scenarios in accomplishing information-theoretic tasks, whether we are in possession of information on the given state does not influence the optimal performance of the asymptotic work extraction.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast switching of telecom photon-number states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial component of photonic quantum information processing platforms is the ability to modulate, route, convert, and switch quantum states of light noiselessly with low insertion loss. For instance, a high-speed, low-loss optical switch is crucial for scaling quantum photonic systems that rely on measurement-based feed-forward approaches. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast all-optical switching of heralded photon-number states using the optical Kerr effect in a single-mode fiber. A local birefringence is created by a high-intensity pump pulse at a center wavelength of 1030nm that temporally overlaps with the 1550nm photon-number states in the fiber. By taking advantage of the dispersion profile of commercially available single-mode fibers, we achieve all-optical switching of photon-number states, with up to 6 photons, with a switching resolution of 2.3ps. A switching efficiency of &gt;99% is reached with a signal-to-noise ratio of 32,000.</description>

      <title>ScarFinder: a detector of optimal scar trajectories in quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Predictive control of blast furnace temperature in steelmaking with hybrid depth-infused quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and stabilization of blast furnace temperatures are crucial for optimizing the efficiency and productivity of steel production. Traditional methods often struggle with the complex and non-linear nature of the temperature fluctuations within blast furnaces. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines hybrid quantum machine learning with pulverized coal injection control to address these challenges. By integrating classical machine learning techniques with quantum computing algorithms, we aim to enhance predictive accuracy and achieve more stable temperature control. For this we utilized a unique prediction-based optimization method. Our method leverages quantum-enhanced feature space exploration and the robustness of classical regression models to forecast temperature variations and optimize pulverized coal injection values. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy over 25 percent and our solution improved temperature stability to +-7.6 degrees of target range from the earlier variance of +-50 degrees, highlighting the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning models in industrial steel production applications.</description>

      <title>A tensor network approach to sensing quantum light-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the fundamental limits to the precision of estimating parameters of a quantum matter system probed by light, even when some of the light is lost. This practically inevitable scenario leads to a tripartite quantum system of matter, and light -- detected and lost. Evaluating fundamental information theoretic quantities such as the quantum Fisher information of only the detected light was heretofore impossible. We succeed by expressing the final quantum state of the detected light as a matrix product operator. We apply our method to resonance fluorescence and pulsed spectroscopy. For both, we quantify the sub-optimality of continuous homodyning and photo-counting measurements in parameter estimation. For the latter, we find that single-photon Fock state pulses allow higher precision per photon than pulses of coherent states. Our method should be valuable in studies of quantum light-matter interactions, quantum light spectroscopy, quantum stochastic thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cramer-Rao Precision Limit of Noisy Continuous Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors hold considerable promise for precision measurement, yet their capabilities are inherently constrained by environmental noise. A fundamental task in quantum sensing is determining the precision limits of noisy sensor devices. For continuously monitored quantum sensors, characterizing the optimal precision in the presence of environments other than the measurement channel is an outstanding open theoretical challenge, due to the infinite-dimensional nature of the sensor output field and the complex temporal correlation of the photons therein. Here, we establish a numerically efficient method to determine the quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) for continuously monitored quantum sensors subject to general environmental noise -- Markovian or non-Markovian, and showcase its application with paradigmatic models of continuously monitored quantum sensors. Our method provides a rigorous and practical framework for assessing and enhancing the sensor performance in realistic settings, with broad applications across experimental quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs. classical: A comprehensive benchmark study for predicting time series with variational quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed as promising tools for time series prediction, with the potential to handle complex sequential data more effectively than classical approaches. However, their practical advantage over established classical methods remains uncertain. In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark study comparing a range of variational quantum algorithms and classical machine learning models for time series forecasting. We evaluate their predictive performance on three chaotic systems across 27 time series prediction tasks of varying complexity, and ensure a fair comparison through extensive hyperparameter optimization. Our results indicate that, in many cases, quantum models struggle to match the accuracy of simple classical counterparts of comparable complexity. Furthermore, we analyze the predictive performance relative to the model complexity and discuss the practical limitations of variational quantum algorithms for time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Constant-time hybrid compilation of Shor's algorithm with quantum just-in-time compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous improvements in quantum computing hardware are exposing the need for simultaneous advances in software. Large-scale implementation of quantum algorithms requires rapid and automated compilation routines such as circuit synthesis and optimization. As systems move towards fault-tolerance, programming frameworks and compilers must also be capable of compiling and optimizing programs comprising both classical and quantum code. This work takes a step in that direction by providing an implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm, compiled to elementary quantum gates using PennyLane and Catalyst, a library for quantum just-in-time (QJIT) compilation of hybrid workflows. We demonstrate that with QJIT compilation, the algorithm is compiled once per bit width of $N$, the integer being factored, even when $N$-specific optimizations are applied to circuit generation based on values determined at runtime. The implementation is benchmarked up to 32-bit $N$, and both the size of the compiled program and the pure compilation time are found to be constant (under 3 seconds on a laptop computer), meaning code generation becomes tractable even for realistic problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Layered KIK quantum error mitigation for dynamic circuits and error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Mitigation is essential for enhancing the reliability of quantum computing experiments. The adaptive KIK error mitigation method has demonstrated significant advantages, including resilience to noise parameter time-drift, applicability to non-Clifford gates, and guaranteed performance bounds. However, its reliance on global noise amplification introduces limitations, such as incompatibility with mid-circuit measurements and dynamic circuits, as well as small unaccounted errors due to higher-order Magnus noise terms. In this work, we propose a layer-based noise amplification approach that overcomes these challenges without incurring additional overhead or experimental complexity. Since the layered KIK framework is inherently compatible with mid-circuit measurements, it enables seamless integration with error correction codes. This synergy allows error correction to address dominant noise mechanisms while the layered KIK suppresses residual errors arising from leakage and correlated noise sources.</description>

      <title>Finding periodic orbits in projected quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing general quantum many-body dynamics is a challenging task due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle this task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system within a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the long-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos.</description>

      <title>Spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric sphere in the modified Langevin noise formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter can be described by means of two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each described by its own spectral density. Therefore, for initial thermal states of the reservoirs having different temperatures, the common approach based on the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object cannot be employed. We study the interaction of a quantum emitter with these two reservoirs introducing a temperature-dependent effective spectral density of the electromagnetic environment, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach.</description>

      <title>Searching for Bloch wave packets with (almost) definite momentum direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional periodic potential can be described in terms of Bloch wave packets. Like free-particle wave packets, they can propagate without attenuation. Here, we examine this similarity more closely by investigating whether Bloch wave packets can maintain a definite -- or nearly definite -- momentum direction, a property inherent to free-particle wave packets. This question is particularly relevant to the feasibility of using solid-state-based systems in the search for the first experimental realization of quantum backflow, a quantum interference effect in which a particle's probability density flows in a direction opposite to its momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimensionality of kernels for Lindbladian superoperators is of physical interest in various scenarios out of equilibrium, for example in mean-field methods for driven-dissipative spin lattice models that give rise to phase diagrams with a multitude of non-equilibrium stationary states in specific parameter regions. We show that known criteria established in the literature for unique fixpoints of the Lindblad master equation can be better treated in a graph-theoretic framework via a focus on the connectivity of directed graphs associated to the Hamiltonian and jump operators.</description>

      <title>Geometric Analysis of the Stabilizer Polytope for Few-Qubit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, or magic, is a fundamental resource for quantum computational advantage, differentiating classically simulatable circuits from those capable of universal quantum computation. In this work, we investigate the geometry of the stabilizer polytope in few-qubit quantum systems, using the trace distance to the stabilizer set to quantify magic. By randomly sampling quantum states, we analyze the distribution of magic for both pure and mixed states and compare the trace distance with other magic measures, as well as entanglement. Additionally, we classify Bell-like inequalities corresponding to the facets of the stabilizer polytope and establish a general concentration result connecting magic and entanglement via Fannes' inequality. Our findings provide new insights into the geometric structure of magic and its role in small-scale quantum systems, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit nanoscale sensing with entanglement as a resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using coherent, single qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators, or using entangled states to improve measurement sensitivity. Here, we describe protocols to use optically unresolved NV center pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise, enabling covariance magnetometry at nanometer length scales. For NV centers that are optically unresolved but have spectrally resolved spin transitions, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations by alternating the relative spin orientations of the two NV centers. For NV centers that are both optically and spectrally unresolved, we leverage the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus that is strongly coupled to one of the NV centers, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable a similar phase-cycling protocol. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole-dipole coupling between two NV centers, and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centers. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV center spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in a dramatic sensitivity improvement. Finally, we demonstrate methods for the detection of high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centers.</description>

Abstract: Mid-circuit measurement and reset of subsets of qubits is a crucial ingredient of quantum error correction and many quantum information applications. Measurement of atomic qubits is accomplished through resonant fluorescence, which typically disturbs neighboring atoms due to photon scattering. We propose and prototype a new scheme for measurement that provides both spatial and spectral isolation by using tightly-focused individual laser beams and narrow atomic transitions. The unique advantage of this scheme is that all operations are applied exclusively to the read-out qubit, with negligible disturbance to the other qubits of the same species and little overhead. In this letter, we pave the way for non-invasive and high fidelity mid-circuit measurement and demonstrate all key building blocks on a single trapped barium ion.</description>

Abstract: We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a trapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We introduce and compare two methods for isolating data qubits from measured qubits: one shelves the data qubit into the metastable state and the other drives the measured qubit to the metastable state without disturbing the other qubits. We experimentally demonstrate both methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$ ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit. These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\%$ without degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\%$. The demonstrated method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the architecture.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Dense Coding Robustness Using Information Entropy-Based Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superdense Coding is a cornerstone in secure quantum communication, exploiting pre-shared entanglement to encode two classical bits within a single qubit. However, noise and decoherence deteriorate entanglement quality, restricting both fidelity and channel capacity in practical settings. Traditional methods, such as error correcting codes or entanglement distillation, are generally inadequate for dynamically varying noise conditions. Moreover, reliance on fidelity alone may fail to capture more subtle noise effects. This work introduces an adaptive protocol that integrates the five-qubit perfect code with a novel global adaptive purification that avoids discarding entangled pairs. By monitoring two information entropy-based metrics, quantum discord (QD) and entanglement of formation (EoF) from pilot pairs, we dynamically tune a global unitary to counteract noise. Our simulations, under both amplitude and phase damping, indicate that this integrated strategy could significantly enhance superdense coding robustness while preserving high throughput, thereby offering a scalable pathway toward a high-capacity quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Featuremetric benchmarking: Quantum computer benchmarks based on circuit features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarks that concisely summarize the performance of many-qubit quantum computers are essential for measuring progress towards the goal of useful quantum computation. In this work, we present a benchmarking framework that is based on quantifying how a quantum computer's performance on quantum circuits varies as a function of features of those circuits, such as circuit depth, width, two-qubit gate density, problem input size, or algorithmic depth. Our featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression. Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search on Bipartite Multigraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks provide a powerful framework for achieving algorithmic speedup in quantum computing. This paper presents a quantum search algorithm for 2-tessellable graphs, a generalization of bipartite graphs, achieving a quadratic speedup over classical Markov chain-based search methods. Our approach employs an adapted version of the Szegedy quantum walk model (adapted SzQW), which takes place on bipartite graphs, and an adapted version of Staggered Quantum Walks (Adapted StQW), which takes place on 2-tessellable graphs, with the goal of efficiently finding a marked vertex by querying an oracle. The Ambainis, Gily\'en, Jeffery, and Kokainis' algorithm (AGJK), which provides a quadratic speedup on balanced bipartite graphs, is used as a subroutine in our algorithm. Our approach generalizes existing quantum walk techniques and offers a quadratic speedup in the number of queries needed, demonstrating the utility of our adapted quantum walk models in a broader class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Solving Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems with Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving combinatorial optimization problems using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) has emerged as a promising research direction. Since the introduction of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), numerous variants have been proposed to enhance its performance. QAOA was later extended to the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+), which generalizes the initial state, phase-separation operator, and mixer to address constrained problems without relying on the standard Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation. However, QAOA+ often requires additional ancilla qubits and a large number of multi-controlled Toffoli gates to prepare the superposition of feasible states, resulting in deep circuits that are challenging for near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, VQAs are generally hindered by issues such as barren plateaus and suboptimal local minima. Recently, Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE), a ground-state preparation algorithm, has been explored as an alternative to QAOA and its variants. QITE has demonstrated improved performance in quantum chemistry problems and has been applied to unconstrained combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut. In this work, we apply the variational form of QITE (VarQITE) to solve the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP), a constrained problem, using a Max-Cut-tailored ansatz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address constrained optimization using VarQITE. We show that VarQITE achieves significantly lower mean optimality gaps compared to QAOA and other conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that scaling the Hamiltonian coefficients can further reduce optimization costs and accelerate convergence.</description>

      <title>Implementing Slack-Free Custom Penalty Function for QUBO on Gate-Based Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization problems using quantum algorithms remains a challenging yet promising avenue toward quantum advantage. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), typically require constrained problems to be reformulated as unconstrained ones using penalty methods.A common approach introduces slack variables and quadratic penalties in the QUBO formulation to handle inequality constraints. However, this leads to increased qubit requirements and often distorts the optimization landscape, making it harder to find high-quality feasible solutions. To address these issues, we explore a slack-free formulation that directly encodes inequality constraints using custom penalty functions, specifically the exponential function and the Heaviside step function. These step-like penalties suppress infeasible solutions without introducing additional qubits or requiring finely tuned weights. Inspired by recent developments in quantum annealing and threshold-based constraint handling in gate-based algorithms, we implement and evaluate our approach on the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). Experimental results show that the step-based formulation significantly improves feasibility and optimality rates compared to unbalanced penalization, while reducing overall qubit overhead.</description>

      <title>Enhancing NDAR with Delay-Gate-Induced Amplitude Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Noise-Directed Adaptive Remapping (NDAR) method utilizes amplitude damping noise to enhance the performance of quantum optimization algorithms. NDAR alternates between exploration by sampling solutions from the quantum circuit and exploitation by transforming the cost Hamiltonian by changing the signs of its terms. Both exploration and exploitation are important components in classical heuristic algorithm design. In this study, we examine how NDAR performance improves by adjusting the balance between these components. We control the degree of exploitation by varying the delay time to 0, 50, and $100~\mu\text{s}$, and investigate exploration strategies using two quantum circuits, QAOA and a random circuit, on IBM's Heron processor. Our results show that increasing delay time in NDAR improves the best objective value found in each iteration. In single-layer QAOA and random circuits applied to unweighted Max-Cut problem with low edge density, both exploration strategies yield similar objective value trajectories and provide competitive solution quality to simulated annealing for the 80-node problem. Their similar performance indicates that, in most cases, increasing amplitude damping noise via additional delay time results in information loss. On the other hand, QAOA outperforms random circuits in specific cases, such as positive-negative weighted Max-Cut on a fully connected graph. This suggests potential advantages of QAOA in more complex settings. We further develop a classical NDAR to better understand exploration strategies, demonstrating that controlling the Hamming weight distribution of sampled bitstrings yields higher quality solutions. This suggests that identifying suitable quantum circuits for exploration could enhance NDAR performance.</description>

      <title>Sampling-based Quantum Optimization Algorithm with Quantum Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) is a hybrid algorithm for noisy quantum devices. However, statistical fluctuations and physical noise degrade the solution quality, so it is difficult to maintain applicability for large-scale problems. In contrast, Sampling-based Quantum Algorithms have recently been successfully applied to large-scale quantum chemistry problems. The quantum device is used only for sampling, and the ground state and its energy are estimated on the classical device. In this study, we propose the Sampling-based Quantum Optimization Algorithm (SQOA). Two challenges exist in constructing a Sampling-based Quantum Algorithm for combinatorial optimization. The first challenge is that we need to encode the optimization problem in a non-diagonal Hamiltonian, even though many VQAs encode it into the Ising Hamiltonian, which is diagonal. The second challenge is that we need a method to prepare the input state to be sampled efficiently. We employ the Quantum Relaxation (QR) method for the first challenge, which encodes multiple classical variables in one qubit. It reduces required qubits compared to the Ising Hamiltonian approach. Moreover, we investigate the parameter transferability in the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for QR Hamiltonians for the second challenge. We show that restricting parameters to a linear form exhibits moderate transferability for 3-regular MaxCut problems, similar to transferability observed in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. This property allows us to efficiently prepare the input state for a large instance using the parameters from a small instance. We leveraged transferability to create input states and applied SQOA with QR to the MaxCut instances. Transferring parameters from a 20-node problem demonstrates that SQOA with QR provides high-quality solutions for 40-node problems without variational parameter optimization.</description>

      <title>Transferring linearly fixed QAOA angles: performance and real device results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) enables solving combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers by optimizing variational parameters for quantum circuits. We investigate a simplified approach that combines linear parameterization with parameter transferring, reducing the parameter space to just 4 dimensions regardless of the number of layers. This simplification draws inspiration from quantum annealing schedules providing both theoretical grounding and practical advantages. We compare this combined approach with standard QAOA and other parameter setting strategies such as INTERP and FOURIER, which require computationally demanding incremental layer-by-layer optimization. Notably, previously known methods like INTERP and FOURIER yield parameters that can be well fitted by linear functions, which supports our linearization strategy. Our analysis reveals that for the random Ising model, cost landscapes in this reduced parameter space demonstrate consistent structural patterns across different problem instances. Our experiments extend from classical simulation to actual quantum hardware implementation on IBM's Eagle processor, demonstrating the approach's viability on current NISQ devices. Furthermore, the numerical results indicate that parameter transferability primarily depends on the energy scale of problem instances, with normalization techniques improving transfer quality. Most of our numerical experiments are conducted on the random Ising model, while problem-dependence is also investigated across other models. A key advantage of parameter transferring is the complete elimination of instance-specific classical optimization overhead, as pre-trained parameters can be directly applied to other problem instances, reducing classical optimization costs by orders of magnitude for deeper circuits.</description>

      <title>Enantiospecific Two-Photon Electric-Dipole Selection Rules of Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing between enantiomers is crucial in the study of chiral molecules in chemistry and pharmacology. Many optical approaches rely on enantiospecific cyclic electric-dipole transitions induced by three microwave or laser beams. However, these approaches impose stringent requirements, including phase locking, three-photon resonance, and precise control over beam intensities and operation times, which enhance the complexity and restrict the applicability. In this letter, we present a novel optical method that {\it eliminates these constraints entirely.} Specifically, we demonstrate that in the presence of a static electric field, the selection rules for two-photon electric-dipole transitions differ between enantiomers. This distinction arises because the static electric field breaks the symmetry associated with the combined action of a specific rotation and time-reversal transformation. Leveraging the enantiospecific two-photon selection rule, one can selectively excite a desired enantiomer using only two beams, without the need for phase locking, resonance condition, and the precise control of their intensities and operation times. Our method significantly enhances the feasibility and applicability of optical approaches for enantiomer differentiation.</description>

      <title>Excitation transfer and many-body dark states in WQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one-dimensional waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, quantum emitters interact through infinite-range, dispersive, and dissipative dipole-dipole interactions mediated by guided photonic modes. These interactions give rise to long-range periodic behavior and rich many-body physics absent in free space. In this work, we construct a set of symmetrized M-excitation dark states and derive analytic expressions for their time-evolution projections. This framework captures the essential dynamics of excitation transport and storage while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to full quantum simulations. Our analysis reveals a fundamental bound on energy redistribution governed by the structure of dark states and collective dissipation, and discovers that optimal excitation transfer between emitter ensembles converges toward an initial pumped fraction of $N_\text{p}/N \approx 0.55$ for large system sizes. We further examine the robustness of this mechanism under realistic imperfections, including positional disorder, nonradiative decay, and dephasing. These results highlight the role of many-body dark states in enabling efficient and controllable energy transfer, offering new insights into dissipative many-body dynamics in integrated quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum devices have unutilized high-level quantum resources. More and more attention has been paid to the qudit quantum systems with larger than two dimensions to maximize the potential computing power of quantum computation. Then, a natural problem arises: How do we implement quantum algorithms on qudit quantum systems? In this work, we propose a novel qudit phase gadget method for synthesizing the qudit diagonal unitary matrices. This method is suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) and fault-tolerant eras due to its versatility in different connectivity architectures and the optimality of its resource consumption. The method can work on any connectivity architecture with asymptotic optimal circuit depth and size. For a 10-qutrit diagonal unitary, our algorithm reduces the circuit depth form about 100000 to 500 with 300 ancillary qutrits. Further, this method can be promoted to different quantum circuit synthesis problems, such as quantum state preparation problems, general unitary synthesis problems, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum algorithms combine the strengths of quantum and classical computing. Many quantum algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), leverage this synergy. However, quantum circuits are executed in full, even when only subsets of measurement outcomes contribute to subsequent classical computations. In this manuscript, we propose a novel circuit optimization technique that identifies and removes dead gates. We prove that the removal of dead gates has no influence on the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes that contribute to the subsequent calculation result. We implemented and evaluated our optimization on a VQE instance, a quantum phase estimation (QPE) instance, and hybrid programs embedded with random circuits of varying circuit width, confirming its capability to remove a non-trivial number of dead gates in real-world algorithms. The effect of our optimization scales up as more measurement outcomes are identified as non-contributory, resulting in a proportionally greater reduction of dead gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we focus on the concept of macroscopic states, i.e. coarse representations of microscopic details, defined as states that can be inferred solely from the outcomes of macroscopic measurements. Building on the theories of quantum statistical sufficiency and quantum Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through several equivalent formulations, ranging from algebraic to explicitly constructive. We introduce a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-decreasing operations and develop a resource theory of microscopicity that unifies and generalizes existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, purity, and asymmetry. Finally, we introduce the concept of inferential reference frames and reinterpret macroscopic entropy as a measure of inferential asymmetry, i.e., irretrodictability.</description>

      <title>A tight consecutive measurement theorem and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many cryptographic tasks, we encounter scenarios where information about two incompatible observables must be retrieved. A natural approach is to perform consecutive measurements, raising a key question: How does the information gained from the first measurement compare to that from both? The consecutive measurement theorem provides a general relation between these quantities and has been used in quantum proofs of knowledge and nonlocal games. However, its previous formulations are often too loose to yield meaningful bounds, especially in quantum nonlocal games. Here, we establish a tight version of the theorem and apply it to improve the best-known bounds on the quantum value of $\text{CHSH}_q(p)$ games and their parallel repetition. We also present a novel application of the theorem to obtain a tighter trade-offs bound in quantum oblivious transfer for certain regimes. These results enhance the theoretical tools for analyzing quantum advantage and have concrete implications for nonlocal games and quantum cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Varying Quantum Lossy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying quantum channels are essential for modeling realistic quantum systems with evolving noise properties. Here, we consider Gaussian lossy channels varying from one use to another and we employ neural networks to classify, regress, and forecast the behavior of these channels from their Choi-Jamiolkowski states. The networks achieve at least 87% of accuracy in distinguishing between non-Markovian, Markovian, memoryless, compound, and deterministic channels. In regression tasks, the model accurately reconstructs the loss parameter sequences, and in forecasting, it predicts future values, with improved performance as the memory parameter approaches 1 for Markovian channels. These results demonstrate the potential of neural networks in characterizing and predicting the dynamics of quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Quantum Error Mitigation Without Reliance on an Accurate Error Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic error cancellation is a quantum error mitigation technique capable of producing unbiased computation results but requires an accurate error model. Constructing this model involves estimating a set of parameters, which, in the worst case, may scale exponentially with the number of qubits. In this paper, we introduce a method called spacetime noise inversion, revealing that unbiased quantum error mitigation can be achieved with just a single accurately measured error parameter and a sampler of Pauli errors. The error sampler can be efficiently implemented in conjunction with quantum error correction. We provide rigorous analyses of bias and cost, showing that the cost of measuring the parameter and sampling errors is low -- comparable to the cost of the computation itself. Moreover, our method is robust to the fluctuation of error parameters, a limitation of unbiased quantum error mitigation in practice. These findings highlight the potential of integrating quantum error mitigation with error correction as a promising approach to suppress computational errors in the early fault-tolerant era.</description>

      <title>Hardness of classically sampling quantum chemistry circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant advances have been made in the study of quantum advantage both in theory and experiment, although these have mostly been limited to artificial setups. In this work, we extend the scope to address quantum advantage in tasks relevant to chemistry and physics. Specifically, we consider the unitary cluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz-a variant of the unitary coupled cluster ansatz, which is widely used to solve the electronic structure problem on quantum computers-to show that sampling from the output distributions of quantum circuits implementing the UCJ ansatz is likely to be classically hard. More specifically, we show that there exist UCJ circuits for which classical simulation of sampling cannot be performed in polynomial time, under a reasonable complexity-theoretical assumption that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse. Our main contribution is to show that a class of UCJ circuits can be used to perform arbitrary instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) computations, which are already known to be classically hard to simulate under the same complexity assumption. As a side result, we also show that UCJ equipped with post-selection can generate the class post-BQP. Our demonstration, worst-case nonsimulatability of UCJ, would potentially imply quantum advantage in quantum algorithms for chemistry and physics using unitary coupled cluster type ansatzes, such as the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum-selected configuration interaction.</description>

      <title>Performance guarantees of light-cone variational quantum algorithms for the maximum cut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising to demonstrate the advantage of near-term quantum computing over classical computing in practical applications, such as the maximum cut (MaxCut) problem. However, current VQAs such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have lower performance guarantees compared to the best-known classical algorithm, and suffer from hard optimization processes due to the barren plateau problem. We propose a light-cone VQA by choosing an optimal gate sequence of the standard VQAs, which enables a significant improvement in solution accuracy while avoiding the barren plateau problem. Specifically, we prove that the light-cone VQA with one round achieves an approximation ratio of 0.7926 for the MaxCut problem in the worst case of $3$-regular graphs, which is higher than that of the 3-round QAOA, and can be further improved to 0.8333 by an angle-relaxation procedure. Finally, these performance guarantees are verified by numerical simulations and hardware demonstrations on IBM quantum devices. In a 72-qubit demonstration, the single-round light-cone VQA achieves the exact MaxCut solution whereas the $p$-round QAOA with $p=1,2,3$ only obtains approximate solutions. Furthermore, the single-round light-cone VQA derives solutions surpassing the hardness threshold in a 148-qubit demonstration while QAOA with $p=1,2,3$ does not. Our work highlights a promising route towards solving practical and classically hard problems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dressed Interference in Giant Superatoms: Entanglement Generation and Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of giant superatoms (GSAs), where two or more interacting atoms are nonlocally coupled to a waveguide through one of them, and explore their unconventional quantum dynamics. For braided GSAs, this setup enables decoherence-free transfer and swapping of their internal entangled states. For separate GSAs, engineering coupling phases leads to state-dependent chiral emission, which enables selective, directional quantum information transfer. This mechanism further facilitates remote generation of W-class entangled states. Our results thereby open exciting possibilities for quantum networks and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A resource theory of asynchronous quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard quantum teleportation, the receiver must wait for a classical message from the sender before subsequently processing the transmitted quantum information. However, in port-based teleportation (PBT), this local processing can begin before the classical message is received, thereby allowing for asynchronous quantum information processing. Motivated by resource-theoretic considerations and practical applications, we propose different communication models that progressively allow for more powerful decoding strategies while still permitting asynchronous distributed quantum computation, a salient feature of standard PBT. Specifically, we consider PBT protocols augmented by free classical processing and/or different forms of quantum pre-processing, and we investigate the maximum achievable teleportation fidelities under such operations. Our analysis focuses specifically on the PBT power of isotropic states, bipartite graph states, and symmetrized EPR states, and we compute tight bounds on the optimal teleportation fidelities for such states. We finally show that, among this hierarchy of communication models consistent with asynchronous quantum information processing, the strongest resource theory is equally as powerful as any one-way teleportation protocol for surpassing the classical teleportation threshold. Thus, a bipartite state can break the one-way classical teleportation threshold if and only if it can be done using the trivial decoding map of discarding subsystems.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced spectroscopy of individual nuclear spins in a dense bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids.</description>

      <title>Computing $n$-time correlation functions without ancilla qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $n$-time correlation function is pivotal for establishing connections between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of a quantum system. Conventional methods for computing $n$-time correlation functions on quantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla qubit that controls the entire system -- an approach that poses challenges for digital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog quantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to compute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the system of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control operations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity requirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of $n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure fermionic and bosonic single-particle spectra of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Schwinger model, respectively, and the out-of-time-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the experiment, we further introduce a signal-processing strategy that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum many-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic hardware limitations and noise.</description>

      <title>Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional canonical quantum plasmonics for finite media: exact solution in terms of the classical Green tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive three-dimensional canonical quantization to treat quantum plasmonics for finite metallic or dielectric media of arbitrary shape. We use a microscopic model for the dissipative and dispersive medium coupled with the electromagnetic field, which is justified by the fact that if one integrates the degrees of freedom of the medium, one obtains the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Its quantization features a Hamiltonian formulation having the form of two infinite harmonic oscillators characterized by a double continuum. The diagonalized Hamiltonian is quantized by the correspondence principle, introducing creation-annihilation operators in a bosonic Fock space. The diagonal quantum Hamiltonian is the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua. The physical observables, like, e.g., the electric field, are also the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua, one of which had been omitted in the literature geared for an infinite bulk medium. In a second step, we show that the electric field operator can by written as linear combinations of the creation-annihilation operators with coefficients that satisfy integral equations of Fredholm type. We show that the solution of these equations can be expressed in terms of the classical Green tensor of the medium satisfying the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Finally, we consider the Purcell effect for the spontaneous emission of an atom close to the medium. We show that through an exact compensation of some terms, the Purcell factor for the system with the double continuum is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green tensor, which defines the local density of states. This result has the same form as the one obtained in the literature for bulk systems that involve a single continuum and a small dissipative background extending to infinity, and can be seen as a justification of this approach.</description>

      <title>Practical Application of the Quantum Carleman Lattice Boltzmann Method in Industrial CFD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations are crucial in industrial applications but require extensive computational resources, particularly for extreme turbulent regimes. While classical digital approaches remain the standard, quantum computing promises a breakthrough by enabling a more efficient encoding of large-scale simulations with a limited number of qubits.
  This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid quantum-classical approach to CFD based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). The inherently non-linear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion and solved using the quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate this method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions, periodic, bounceback, and moving wall, using statevector emulation on high-performance computing resources.
  Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error fidelities on the order of $10^{-3}$ and success probabilities sufficient for practical quantum state sampling. Notably, the spectral properties of small lattice systems closely approximate those of larger ones, suggesting a pathway to mitigate one of HHL's bottlenecks: eigenvalue pre-evaluation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present Quantum-Inspired Model Predictive Control (QIMPC), an approach that uses Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) to learn control polices in MPC problems. The viability of the approach is tested in five experiments: A target-tracking control strategy, energy-efficient building climate control, autonomous vehicular dynamics, the simple pendulum, and the compound pendulum. Three safety guarantees were established for the approach, and the experiments gave the motivation for two important theoretical results that, in essence, identify systems for which the approach works best.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Decoding of Circuit-Level Noise for Bivariate Bicycle Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers will depend crucially on the performance of the classical decoding algorithm which takes in the results of measurements and outputs corrections to the errors inferred to have occurred. Machine learning models have shown great promise as decoders for the surface code; however, this promise has not yet been substantiated for the more challenging task of decoding quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. In this paper, we present a recurrent, transformer-based neural network designed to decode circuit-level noise on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes, introduced recently by Bravyi et al (Nature 627, 778-782, 2024). For the $[[72,12,6]]$ BB code, at a physical error rate of $p=0.1\%$, our model achieves a logical error rate almost $5$ times lower than belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding (BP-OSD). Moreover, while BP-OSD has a wide distribution of runtimes with significant outliers, our model has a consistent runtime and is an order-of-magnitude faster than the worst-case times from a benchmark BP-OSD implementation. On the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, our model obtains worse logical error rates but maintains the speed advantage. These results demonstrate that machine learning decoders can out-perform conventional decoders on QLDPC codes, in regimes of current interest.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is central to both the foundations of quantum mechanics and the development of new technologies in information processing, communication, and sensing. Entanglement has been realised in a variety of physical systems, spanning atoms, ions, photons, collective excitations, and hybrid combinations of particles. Remarkably, however, photons and free electrons -- the quanta of light and their most elementary sources -- have never been observed in an entangled state. Here, we demonstrate quantum entanglement between free electrons and photons. We show that entanglement is produced when an electron, prepared in a superposition of two beams, passes a nanostructure and generates transition radiation in a polarisation state tied to the electron path. By implementing quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the full density matrix of the electron-photon pair, and show that the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion is violated by more than 7 standard deviations. Based on this foundational element of emerging free-electron quantum optics, we anticipate manifold developments in enhanced electron imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. More broadly, the ability to generate and measure entanglement opens electron microscopy to previously inaccessible quantum observables and correlations in solids and nanostructures.</description>

Abstract: A lemma by Chen et al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 475304 (2017)] provides a necessary condition on the structure of any complex Hadamard matrix in a set of four mutually unbiased bases in $\mathbb{C}^6$. The proof of the lemma is shown to contain a mistake, ultimately invalidating three theorems derived in later publications.</description>

      <title>Feedforward suppression of readout-induced faults in quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to reduce readout-induced faults, applicable in settings like quantum error correction with repeated measurement cycles. The method consists of an adaptive readout sequence conditioned on each check qubit's readout result from the previous cycle. For readout errors and measurement-induced leakage that are stronger in a particular qubit state, this feedforward protocol can suppress the physical qubit errors. Focusing on a simple realization of conditionally flipping (by an X gate) the state of check qubits before their measurement, we investigate the effect of such state-dependent errors using simulations in the setup of a low-density parity check code. We show that the suggested protocol can reduce both logical errors and decoding time, two important aspects of fault-tolerant quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Energy Landscape Plummeting in Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Subspace Optimization, Non-iterative Corrections and Generator-informed Initialization for Improved Quantum Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) faces significant challenges due to hardware noise and the presence of barren plateaus and local traps in the optimization landscape. To mitigate the detrimental effects of these issues, we introduce a general formalism that optimizes hardware resource utilization and accuracy by projecting VQE optimizations on to a reduced-dimensional subspace, followed by a set of posteriori corrections. Our method partitions the ansatz into a lower dimensional principal subspace and a higher-dimensional auxiliary subspace based on a conjecture of temporal hierarchy present among the parameters during optimization. The adiabatic approximation exploits this hierarchy, restricting optimization to the lower dimensional principal subspace only. This is followed by an efficient higher dimensional auxiliary space reconstruction without the need to perform variational optimization. These reconstructed auxiliary parameters are subsequently included in the cost-function via a set of auxiliary subspace corrections (ASC) leading to a "plummeting effect" in the energy landscape toward a more optimal minima without utilizing any additional quantum hardware resources. Numerical simulations show that, when integrated with any chemistry-inspired ansatz, our method can provide one to two orders of magnitude better estimation of the minima. Additionally, based on the adiabatic approximation, we introduce a novel initialization strategy driven by unitary rotation generators for accelerated convergence of gradient-informed dynamic quantum algorithms. Our method shows heuristic evidences of alleviating the effects of local traps, facilitating convergence toward a more optimal minimum.</description>

      <title>Tunable Entangling and Steering of Ferrimagnetic Magnons via an OptoMagnoMechanical Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, magnomechanical systems have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies, exploiting magnon-photon-phonon interactions to store high-fidelity quantum information. In this paper, we propose a scheme to entangle two spatially separated ferrimagnetic YIG crystals by injecting a microwave field into an optomagnonic ring cavity. The proposed optomagnomechanical configuration utilizes the coupling between magnetostriction-induced mechanical displacements and the optical cavity via radiation pressure. Magnons - collective spin excitations in macroscopic ferromagnets - are directly driven by an electromagnetic field. We demonstrate the generation of macroscopic magnon entanglement by exciting the optical cavity with a red detuned microwave field and the YIG crystals with a blue detuned field. Our analysis reveals that magnon entanglement vanishes for identical magnomechanical couplings but remains robust against thermal fluctuations. The magnon modes entangled in two ferrimagnetic crystals represent genuine macroscopic quantum states with potential applications in the study of macroscopic quantum mechanics and quantum information processing based on magnonics. The configuration is based on experimentally accessible parameters, providing a feasible route of quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel concept for measuring time-varying electric field transients of petahertz-scale photons down to a single-photon regime. We observe a clear transition from classical to quantum nature of light that agrees with our Monte Carlo model. We reach unprecedented yoctojoule-level sensitivity and a dynamic range exceeding 90 decibels. We utilize this capability to measure time-dependent intrapulse light coherence - a regime inaccessible to conventional, time-averaged spectroscopy. This opens new avenues for quantum information, cryptography, and quantum light-matter interactions on sub-cycle time scales with attosecond precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement, a key resource of emerging quantum technologies, describes correlations between particles that defy classical physics. It has been studied extensively on various platforms, but has remained elusive in electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopes are well-established tools for materials characterisation with unparalleled spatial resolution. They provide control over the preparation and detection of high energy electrons, with largely unexploited potential in the study of many-body quantum correlations. Here, we demonstrate entanglement in electron-photon pairs generated via cathodoluminescence in a transmission electron microscope. Employing coincidence imaging techniques adapted from photonic quantum optics, we reconstruct both near- and far-field ``ghost'' images of periodic transmission masks. By measuring spatial and momentum correlations, we show a violation of the classical uncertainty bound: $\Delta x_-^2 \Delta k_+^2 = 0.502 \pm 0.047&lt;1$. Hence, we demonstrate entanglement in position and momentum -- the continuous variables at the base of most imaging methods, bridging the fields of electron microscopy and quantum optics. Our work paves the way for exploring quantum correlations in free-electron systems and their application to quantum-enhanced imaging techniques on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Minute-long quantum coherence enabled by electrical depletion of magnetic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating solid-state spin defects into classical electronic devices can enable new opportunities for quantum information processing that benefit from existing semiconductor technology. We show, through bias control of an isotopically purified silicon carbide (SiC) p-i-n diode, the depletion of not only electrical noise sources but also magnetic noise sources, resulting in record coherences for SiC electron spin qubits. We also uncover complementary improvements to the relaxation times of nuclear spin registers controllable by the defect, and measure diode-enhanced coherences. These improvements lead to record-long nuclear spin Hahn-echo times on the scale of minutes. These results demonstrate the power of materials control and electronic device integration to create highly coherent solid-state quantum network nodes and processors.</description>

      <title>Restoring Heisenberg scaling in time via autonomous quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a sufficient condition under which autonomous quantum error correction (AutoQEC) can effectively restore Heisenberg scaling (HS) in quantum metrology. Specifically, we show that if all Lindblad operators associated with the noise commute with the signal Hamiltonian and a particular constrained linear equation admits a solution, then an ancilla-free AutoQEC scheme with finite $R$ (where $R$ represents the ratio between the engineered dissipation rate for AutoQEC and the noise rate,) can approximately preserve HS with desired small additive error $\epsilon &gt; 0$ over any time interval $0 \leq t \leq T$. We emphasize that the error scales as $ \epsilon = O(\kappa T / R^c) $ with $c \geq 1$, indicating that the required $R$ decreases significantly with increasing $c$ to achieve a desired error. Furthermore, we discuss that if the sufficient condition is not satisfied, logical errors may be induced that cannot be efficiently corrected by the canonical AutoQEC framework. Finally, we numerically verify our analytical results by employing the concrete example of phase estimation under dephasing noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for solving nonlinear differential equations based on physics-informed effective Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a distinct approach to solving linear and nonlinear differential equations (DEs) on quantum computers by encoding the problem into ground states of effective Hamiltonian operators. Our algorithm relies on constructing such operators in the Chebyshev space, where an effective Hamiltonian is a sum of global differential and data constraints. Once the effective Hamiltonian is formed, solutions of differential equations can be obtained using the ground state preparation techniques (e.g. imaginary-time evolution and quantum singular value transformation), bypassing variational search. Unlike approaches based on discrete grids, the algorithm enables evaluation of solutions beyond fixed grid points and implements constraints in the physics-informed way. Our proposal inherits the best traits from quantum machine learning-based DE solving (compact basis representation, automatic differentiation, nonlinearity) and quantum linear algebra-based approaches (fine-grid encoding, provable speed-up for state preparation), offering a robust strategy for quantum scientific computing in the early fault-tolerant era.</description>

      <title>The quantum nature of color perception: Uncertainty relations for chromatic opposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an overview on the foundation and first results of a very recent quantum theory of color perception, together with novel results about uncertainty relations for chromatic opposition. The major inspiration for this model is the 1974 remarkable work by H.L. Resnikoff, who had the idea to give up the analysis of the space of perceived colors through metameric classes of spectra in favor of the study of its algebraic properties. This strategy permitted to reveal the importance of hyperbolic geometry in colorimetry. Starting from these premises, we show how Resnikoff's construction can be extended to a geometrically rich quantum framework, where the concepts of achromatic color, hue and saturation can be rigorously defined. Moreover, the analysis of pure and mixed quantum chromatic states leads to a deep understanding of chromatic opposition and its role in the encoding of visual signals. We complete our paper by proving the existence of uncertainty relations for the degree of chromatic opposition, thus providing a theoretical confirmation of the quantum nature of color perception.</description>

      <title>Qiskit Quantum Circuits Posit Singlet state in Radical Pair-based Magnetoreception of Migratory Birds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing applications in diverse domains are emerging rapidly. Given the limitations of classical computing techniques, the peculiarity of quantum circuits, which can observe quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum coherence, is remarkable. This capability enables them to achieve measurement sensitivities far beyond classical limits. Research on radical pair-based magnetoreception in migratory birds has been a focus area for quite some time. A quantum mechanics-based computing approach, thus unsurprisingly, identifies a scope of application. In this study, to observe the phenomenon, electron-nucleus spin quantum circuits for different geomagnetic fluxes have been simulated and run through IBM Qiskit quantum processing units with error mitigation techniques. The results of different quantum states are consistent, suggesting singlet-triplet mechanisms that can be emulated, resembling the environment-enabling flights of migratory birds through generations of the avian species. The four-qubit model emulating electron-nucleus systems mimicking the environmental complexity outcome shows the sensitiveness to change of magnetic flux index, high probability of singlet-triplet dynamics, and upholding radical pair model states by the purity of the sub-system and full system outcome of coherence, the hallmark of singlet state dominance. The work involved performing fifty quantum circuits for different magnetic field values, each with one thousand and twenty-four shots for measurement, either in the simulator or on real quantum hardware, and for two error mitigation techniques, preceded by a noise model of a simulator run.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Creation in Condensed Matter: A Conceptual Framework for Modeling Money-Debt Dynamics in Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a field-theoretic framework that models money-debt dynamics in economic systems through a direct analogy to particle-hole creation in condensed matter physics. In this formulation, issuing credit generates a symmetric pair-money as a particle-like excitation and debt as its hole-like counterpart-embedded within a monetary vacuum field. The model is formalized via a second-quantized Hamiltonian that incorporates time-dependent perturbations to represent real-world effects such as interest and profit, which drive asymmetry and systemic imbalance. This framework successfully captures both macroeconomic phenomena, including quantitative easing (QE) and gold-backed monetary regimes, and microeconomic credit creation, under a unified quantum-like formalism. In particular, QE is interpreted as generating entangled-like pairs of currency and bonds, exhibiting systemic correlations akin to nonlocal quantum interactions. Asset-backed systems, on the other hand, are modeled as coherent superpositions that collapse upon use. This approach provides physicists with a rigorous and intuitive toolset to analyze economic behavior using many-body theory, laying the groundwork for a new class of models in econophysics and interdisciplinary field analysis.</description>

      <title>Tests of quantum contextuality in particle physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality refers to the impossibility of assigning a predefined, intrinsic value to a physical property of a system independently of the context in which the property is measured. It is, perhaps, the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. The many states with different spin that particle physics provides are the ideal setting for testing contextuality. We verify that the polarization states of single spin-1 massive particles produced at colliders are contextual. We test $W^{+}$ gauge bosons produced in top-quark decays, $J/\psi$ and $K^{*}(892)^0$ mesons in $B$-meson decays and $\phi$ mesons in $\chi^0_c$ and $\chi^1_c$ charmonium decays by reinterpreting the data and the analyses of the ATLAS, LHCb, Belle II and BESIII experimental collaborations, respectively. The polarization states of these four particles show contextuality with a significance larger than $5\sigma$. We also discuss the presence of quantum contextuality in spin states of bipartite systems formed by spin-1/2 particles. We test $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ baryons reinterpreting two BESIII data analyses, and pairs of top quarks utilizing a recent analysis of the CMS collaboration. Quantum contextuality is present with a significance exceeding $5\sigma$ also in these cases. In addition, we study the feasibility of testing quantum contextuality by means of $Z$ boson production in association with the Higgs boson, $Z$ and $W$ bosons pairs created in Higgs boson decays and with pairs of $\tau$ leptons. For the latter, we use Monte Carlo simulations that mimic the settings of SuperKEKB and of future lepton colliders. Experiments at high energies, though not designed for the purpose, perform surprisingly well in testing for quantum contextuality.</description>

      <title>Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a sharp learning transition for the two-dimensional classical Ising model, all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our results can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>Standardization of Multi-Objective QUBOs</title>

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are scarce.</description>

      <title>Valley Splitting Correlations Across a Silicon Quantum Well</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and &gt;1{\mu}m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.</description>

      <title>Coarsening of binary Bose superfluids: an effective theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an effective equation of motion for binary Bose mixtures, which generalizes the Cahn-Hilliard description of classical binary fluids to superfluid systems. Within this approach, based on a microscopic Hamiltonian formulation, we show that the domain growth law $L(t)\sim t^{2/3}$ observed in superfluid mixtures is not driven by hydrodynamic flows, but arises from the competition between interactions and quantum pressure. The effective theory allows us to derive key properties of superfluid coarsening, including domain growth and Porod's laws. This provides a new theoretical framework for understanding phase separation in superfluid mixtures.</description>

      <title>Can spacetime fluctuations generate entanglement between co-moving accelerated detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies [Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 03LT01 (2025); Phys. Rev. D 111, 045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of former Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in shifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift parameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift parameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a set-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find that if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get infinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this entanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift parameter, provided it is non-vanishing. We investigate the dependence of entanglement on acceleration of the detectors. The present study indicates that the entanglement between two detectors, moving on the same Rindler wedge, is possible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations can lead to entanglement between detectors, moving along same classical trajectory. Hence we feel that such theoretical prediction has potential to probe the Planck length nature of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Combining the Maximum Overlap Method with Multiwavelets for Core-Ionisation Energy Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol for computing core-ionisation energies for molecules, which is essential for reproducing X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The electronic structure of both the ground state and the core-ionised states are computed using Multiwavelets and Density-Functional Theory, where the core ionisation energies are computed by virtue of the $\Delta$SCF method. To avoid the collapse of the core-hole state or its delocalisation, we make use of the Maximum Overlap Method, which provides a constraint on the orbital occupation. Combining Multiwavelets with the Maximum Overlap Method allows for the first time an all-electron calculation of core-ionisation energies with Multiwavelets, avoiding known issues connected to the use of Atomic Orbitals (slow convergence with respect to the basis set limit, numerical instabilities of core-hole states for large systems). We show that our results are consistent with previous Multiwavelet calculations which made use of pseudopotentials, and are generally more precise than corresponding Atomic Orbital calculations. We analyse the results in terms of precision compared to both Atomic Orbital calculations and Multiwavelets+pseudopotentials calculations. Moreover, we demonstrate how the protocol can be applied to target molecules of relatively large size. Both closed-shell and open-shell methods have been implemented.</description>

      <title>Long-wavelength optical lattices from optical beatnotes: theory and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of Beat-Note Superlattices (BNSLs), a recently demonstrated technique for generating periodic trapping potentials for ultracold atomic clouds, with arbitrarily large lattice spacings while maintaining interferometric stability. By combining two optical lattices with slightly different wavelengths, a beatnote intensity pattern is formed, generating, for low depths, an effective lattice potential with a periodicity equal to the wavelength associated to the difference between the wavevectors of the two lattices. We study the range of lattice depths and wavelengths under which this approximation is valid and investigate its robustness against perturbations. We present a few examples where the use of BNSLs could offer significant advantages in comparison to well established techniques for the manipulation of ultracold atomic gases. Our results highlight the potential of BNSLs for quantum simulation, atom interferometry, and other applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow water waves are a striking example of nonlinear hydrodynamics, giving rise to phenomena such as tsunamis and undular waves. These dynamics are typically studied in hundreds-of-meter-long wave flumes. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale, quantum-enabled wave flume. The wave flume exploits nanometer-thick superfluid helium films and optomechanical interactions to achieve nonlinearities surpassing those of extreme terrestrial flows. Measurements reveal wave steepening, shock fronts, and soliton fission -- nonlinear behaviors long predicted in superfluid helium but never previously directly observed. Our approach enables lithography-defined wave flume geometries, optomechanical control of hydrodynamic properties, and orders of magnitude faster measurements than terrestrial flumes. Together, this opens a new frontier in hydrodynamics, combining quantum fluids and nanophotonics to explore complex wave dynamics at microscale.</description>

      <title>Hopf Exceptional Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Quantum-gas microscopy of the Bose-glass phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered potentials fundamentally alter the transport properties and coherence of quantum systems. They give rise to phenomena such as Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, inhibiting transport. When interactions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly more complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed remain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is expected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state without long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a ground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite temperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced phase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold bosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the Bose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved, reproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ distribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the Edwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the Bose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with single-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of the Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior.</description>

      <title>High-Stability Single-Ion Clock with $5.5\times10^{-19}$ Systematic Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical atomic clock with fractional frequency uncertainty of $5.5\times10^{-19}$ and fractional frequency stability of $3.5 \times10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, based on quantum logic spectroscopy of a single $^{27}$Al$^+$ ion. A co-trapped $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion provides sympathetic cooling and quantum logic readout of the $^{27}$Al$^+$ $^1$S$_0\leftrightarrow^3$P$_0$ clock transition. A Rabi probe duration of 1 s, enabled by laser stability transfer from a remote cryogenic silicon cavity across a 3.6 km fiber link, results in a threefold reduction in instability compared to previous $^{27}$Al$^+$ clocks. Systematic uncertainties are lower due to an improved ion trap electrical design, which reduces excess micromotion, and a new vacuum system, which reduces collisional shifts. We also perform a direction-sensitive measurement of the ac magnetic field due to the RF ion trap, eliminating systematic uncertainty due to field orientation.</description>

      <title>Many-body cages: disorder-free glassiness from flat bands in Fock space, and many-body Rabi oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the many-body counterpart of flat bands, which we call many-body caging, as a general mechanism for non-equilibrium phenomena such as a novel type of glassy eigenspectrum order and many-body Rabi oscillations in the time domain. We focus on constrained systems of great current interest in the context of Rydberg atoms and synthetic or emergent gauge theories. We find that their state graphs host motifs which produce flat bands in the many-body spectrum at a particular set of energies. Basis states in Fock space exhibit Edwards-Anderson type parameters in the absence of quenched disorder, with an intricate, possibly fractal, distribution over Fock space which is reflected in a distinctive structure of a non-vanishing post-quench long-time Loschmidt echo, an experimentally accessible quantity.In general, phenomena familiar from single-particle flat bands manifest themselves in characteristic many-body incarnations, such as a reentrant `Anderson' delocalisation, offering a rich ensemble of experimental signatures in the abovementioned quantum simulators. The variety of single-particle flat band types suggests an analogous typology--and concomitant phenomenological richness to be explored--of their many-body counterparts.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a thought experiment that demonstrates that the equivalence of quantum reduced states and statistical mixed states of ensembles is not merely a simple mathematical formulation in quantum mechanics, but rather possesses profound physical underpinnings. Based on the equivalence, we give a possible solution to the quantum measurement problem. We describe quantum measurement process as two-step physical process: one microscopically controllable process which generates an entanglement between the system being measured and a marking system (or property), and one macroscopic process (uncontrollable microscopically) which detects states (or properties) of the marking system. With the solution, we conclude that the measurement postulate is just a corollary of the completeness of quantum states. Our solution is entirely rooted in the traditional formalism of quantum mechanics, requiring no extensions or modifications to it. We also point out that quantum randomness originates from entanglement, and the collapse of the wave function is a subjective process.</description>

Abstract: This work makes progress on the issue of global vs. local master equations. Global master equations like the Redfield master equation (following from standard Born and Markov approximation) require a full diagonalization of the system Hamiltonian. This is especially challenging for interacting quantum many-body systems. We discuss a short-bath-correlation-time expansion in reciprocal (energy) space, leading to a series expansion of the jump operator, which avoids a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. For a bath that is coupled locally to one site, this typically leads to an expansion of the global Redfield jump operator in terms of local operators. We additionally map the local Redfield master equation to a novel local Lindblad form, giving an equation which has the same conceptual advantages of traditional local Lindblad approaches, while being applicable in a much broader class of systems. Our ideas give rise to a non-heuristic foundation of local master equations, which can be combined with established many-body methods.</description>

Abstract: Introducing disorderness in the superconducting materials has been considered promising to enhance the electromagnetic impedance and realize noise-resilient superconducting qubits. Despite a number of pioneering implementations, the understanding of the correlation between the material disorderness and the qubit coherence is still developing. Here, we demonstrate a systematic characterization of fluxonium qubits with the superinductors made from titanium-aluminum-nitride with varied disorderness. From qubit noise spectroscopy, the flux noise and the dielectric loss are extracted as a measure of the coherence properties. Our results reveal that the $1/f$ flux noise dominates the qubit decoherence around the flux-frustration point, strongly correlated with the material disorderness; while the dielectric loss remains low under a wide range of material properties. From the flux-noise amplitudes, the areal density ($\sigma$) of the phenomenological spin defects and material disorderness are found to be approximately correlated by $\sigma \propto \rho_{xx}^3$, or effectively $(k_F l)^{-3}$. This work has provided new insights on the origin of decoherence channels within superconductors, and could serve as a useful guideline for material design and optimization.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric mapping of three states and its implementation on a cloud quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems have garnered significant attention due to their unconventional properties. Despite the growing interest, there remains an ongoing debate about whether these systems outperform their Hermitian counterparts in practical applications, and if so, by what metrics this performance should be measured. We developed $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric approach for mapping $N = 3$ pure qubit states to address this, implemented it using the dilation method, and demonstrated it on a superconducting quantum processor from the IBM Quantum Experience. For the first time, we derived exact expressions for the population of the post-selected $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric subspace for both $N = 2$ and $N = 3$ states. When applied to the discrimination of $N = 2$ pure states, our algorithm provides an equivalent result to the conventional unambiguous quantum state discrimination. For $N = 3$ states, our approach introduces novel capabilities not available in traditional Hermitian systems, enabling the transformation of an arbitrary set of three pure quantum states into another, at the cost of introducing an inconclusive outcome. Our algorithm has the same error rate for the attack on the three-state QKD protocol as the conventional minimum error, maximum confidence, and maximum mutual information strategies. For post-selected quantum metrology, our results provide precise conditions where $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum sensors outperform their Hermitian counterparts in terms of information-cost rate. Combined with punctuated unstructured quantum database search, our method significantly reduces the qubit readout requirements at the cost of adding an ancilla, while maintaining the same average number of oracle calls as the original punctuated Grover's algorithm. Our work opens new pathways for applying $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in quantum communications, computing, and cryptography.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Unitary Property Testing with Proofs and Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In unitary property testing a quantum algorithm, also known as a tester, is given query access to a black-box unitary and has to decide whether it satisfies some property. We propose a new technique for proving lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of unitary property testing and related problems, which utilises its connection to unitary channel discrimination. The main advantage of this technique is that all obtained lower bounds hold for any $\mathsf{C}$-tester with $\mathsf{C} \subseteq \mathsf{QMA}(2)/\mathsf{qpoly}$, showing that even having access to both (unentangled) quantum proofs and advice does not help for many unitary property testing problems. We apply our technique to prove lower bounds for problems like quantum phase estimation, the entanglement entropy problem, quantum Gibbs sampling and more, removing all logarithmic factors in the lower bounds obtained by the sample-to-query lifting theorem of Wang and Zhang (2023). As a direct corollary, we show that there exist quantum oracles relative to which $\mathsf{QMA}(2) \not\supset \mathsf{SBQP}$ and $\mathsf{QMA}/\mathsf{qpoly} \not\supset \mathsf{SBQP}$. The former shows that, at least in a black-box way, having unentangled quantum proofs does not help in solving problems that require high precision.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant structures for measurement-based quantum computation on a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a method to construct fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) architectures and numerically estimate their performance over various types of networks. A possible application of such a paradigm is distributed quantum computation, where separate computing nodes work together on a fault-tolerant computation through entanglement. We gauge error thresholds of the architectures with an efficient stabilizer simulator to investigate the resilience against both circuit-level and network noise. We show that, for both monolithic (i.e., non-distributed) and distributed implementations, an architecture based on the diamond lattice may outperform the conventional cubic lattice. Moreover, the high erasure thresholds of non-cubic lattices may be exploited further in a distributed context, as their performance may be boosted through entanglement distillation by trading in entanglement success rates against erasure errors during the error-decoding process. These results highlight the significance of lattice geometry in the design of fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing on a network, emphasizing the potential for constructing robust and scalable distributed quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the quantum Ising model on two-dimensional square lattices up to $16 \times 16$ spins. In the ordered phase, the model is predicted to exhibit dynamically constrained dynamics, leading to confinement of elementary excitations and slow thermalization. After demonstrating the signatures of confinement, we probe the dynamics of interfaces in the constrained regime through sudden quenches of product states with domains of opposite magnetization. We find that the nature of excitations can be captured by perturbation theory throughout the confining regime, and identify the crossover to the deconfining regime. We systematically explore the effect of the transverse field on the modes propagating along flat interfaces and investigate the crossover from resonant to diffusive melting of a square of flipped spins embedded in a larger lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21776v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the time-averaged spread complexity compared to that which is obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.</description>

      <title>Alternatives of entanglement depth and metrological entanglement criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work out the general theory of one-parameter families of partial entanglement properties and the resulting entanglement depth-like quantities. Special cases of these are the depth of partitionability, the depth of producibility (or simply entanglement depth) and the depth of stretchability, which are based on one-parameter families of partial entanglement properties known earlier. We also construct some further physically meaningful properties, for instance the squareability, the toughness, the degree of freedom, and also several ones of entropic motivation. Metrological multipartite entanglement criteria with the quantum Fisher information fit naturally into this framework. Here we formulate these for the depth of squareability, which therefore turns out to be the natural choice, leading to stronger bounds than the usual entanglement depth. Namely, the quantum Fisher information turns out to provide a lower bound not only on the maximal size of entangled subsystems, but also on the average size of entangled subsystems for a random choice of elementary subsystems. We also formulate criteria with convex quantities for both cases, which are much stronger than the original ones. In particular, the quantum Fisher information puts a lower bound on the average size of entangled subsystems. We also argue that one-parameter partial entanglement properties, which carry entropic meaning, are more suitable for the purpose of defining metrological bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method enhances optimization in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by incorporating geometric insights from the quantum state space through the Fubini-Study metric. In this work, we extend QNG by introducing higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections using the Riemannian Euler update rule and geodesic equations, deriving an updated rule for the Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Correction (QNGGC). We also develop an efficient method for computing the Christoffel symbols necessary for these corrections, leveraging the parameter-shift rule to enable direct measurement from quantum circuits. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, we demonstrate that QNGGC significantly improves convergence rates over standard QNG, highlighting the benefits of integrating geodesic corrections into quantum optimization processes. Our approach paves the way for more efficient quantum algorithms, leveraging the advantages of geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wasserstein Compilation: Unitary Compilation using the Quantum Earth Mover's Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advances in the development of quantum computers, the practical application of quantum algorithms requiring deep circuit depths or high-fidelity transformations remains outside the current range of the so-called noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Now and beyond, quantum circuit compilation (QCC) is a crucial component of any quantum algorithm execution. Besides translating a circuit into hardware-specific gates, it can optimize circuit depth and adapt to noise. Variational quantum circuit compilation (VQCC) optimizes the parameters of an ansatz according to the goal of reproducing a given unitary transformation. In this work, we present a VQCC-objective function called the quantum Wasserstein compilation (QWC) cost function based on the quantum Wasserstein distance of order 1. We show that the QWC cost function upper bounds the average infidelity of two circuits. An estimation method based on measurements of local Pauli-observable is utilized in a generative adversarial network to learn a given quantum circuit. We demonstrate the efficacy of the QWC cost function by compiling hardware efficient ansatz (HEA) as both the target and the ansatz and comparing to cost functions such as the Loschmidt echo test (LET) and the Hilbert-Schmidt test (HST). Finally, our experiments demonstrate that QWC as a cost function is the least affected by barren plateaus when compared to LET and HST for deep enough circuits.</description>

      <title>Temporal Bell inequalities in non-relativistic many-body physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing the spreading of information in many-body systems is crucial to understanding their quantum dynamics. At the most fundamental level, this task is accomplished by Bell inequalities, whose violation by quantum mechanics implies that information cannot always be stored locally. While Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties perform measurements on systems at different positions, one could formulate temporal inequalities, in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected measurement events, these extensions are compatible with a local description, so that no intrinsically-quantum information spreading is involved in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for a nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. Since the chain constitutes the sole medium for the spreading of quantum information, it prevents the immediate vanishing of Bell correlations after the first measurement and it induces violation revivals. The dynamics we analyze shows that, as expected in a non-relativistic setup, the spreading of information is fundamentally limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. New insights on many-body quantum dynamics could emerge through future applications of our temporal Bell inequality to more general systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementing the time evolution under a desired target Hamiltonian is critical for various applications in quantum science. Due to the exponential increase of parameters in the system size and due to experimental imperfections this task can be challenging in quantum many-body settings. We introduce an efficient and robust scheme to engineer arbitrary local many-body Hamiltonians. This is achieved by applying simple single-qubit gates simultaneously to an always-on system Hamiltonian, which we assume to be native to a given platform. These sequences are constructed by efficiently solving a linear program (LP) which minimizes the total evolution time. In this way, we can engineer target Hamiltonians that are only limited by the locality of the Pauli terms in the system Hamiltonian. Based on average Hamiltonian theory and by using robust composite pulses, we make our schemes robust against errors including finite pulse time errors and various calibration errors. To demonstrate the performance of our scheme, we provide numerical simulations. In particular, we solve the Hamiltonian engineering problem for arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice with $225$ qubits in only $60$ seconds. Moreover, we simulate the time evolution of Heisenberg Hamiltonians for smaller system sizes with a fidelity larger than $99.9\%$, which is orders of magnitude better than non-robust implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop methods for performing quantum teleportation of the total spin variables of an unknown state, using quantum nondemolition measurements, spin projection measurements, and classical communication. While theoretically teleportation of high-dimensional states can be attained with the assumption of generalized Bell measurements, this is typically experimentally non-trivial to implement. We introduce two protocols and show that, on average, the teleportation succeeds in teleporting the spin variables of a spin coherent state with average zero angular error in the ideal case, beating classical strategies based on quantum state estimation. In a single run of the teleportation, there is an angular error at the level of ~ 0.1 radians for large ensembles. A potential physical implementation for the scheme is with atomic ensembles and quantum nondemolition measurements performed with light. We analyze the decoherence of the protocols and find that the protocol is robust even in the limit of large ensemble sizes.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a robust and scalable framework for implementing nested affine transformations in quantum circuits. Utilizing Hadamard-supported conditional initialization and block encoding, the proposed method systematically applies sequential affine transformations while preserving state normalization. This approach provides an effective method for generating combinatorial amplitude patterns within quantum states with demonstrated applications in combinatorics and signal processing. The utility of the framework is exemplified through two key applications: financial risk assessment, where it efficiently computes portfolio returns using combinatorial sum of amplitudes, and discrete signal processing, where it enables precise manipulation of Fourier coefficients for enhanced signal reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on developing efficient post-hoc explanations for quantum AI algorithms. In classical contexts, the cooperative game theory concept of the Shapley value adapts naturally to post-hoc explanations, where it can be used to identify which factors are important in an AI's decision-making process. An interesting question is how to translate Shapley values to the quantum setting and whether quantum effects could be used to accelerate their calculation. We propose quantum algorithms that can extract Shapley values within some confidence interval. Our method is capable of quadratically outperforming classical Monte Carlo approaches to approximating Shapley values up to polylogarithmic factors in various circumstances. We demonstrate the validity of our approach empirically with specific voting games and provide rigorous proofs of performance for general cooperative games.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian two-time correlation functions for optomechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the two-time correlation function (TTCF) of the cavity optomechanical system, which serves as the most popular tool in precision detection technologies. We utilize the stochastic Schrodinger equation approach to study TTCF for the cavity optomechanical system in the long-time steady state TTCF and time-dependent case. Our numerical simulations support two major conclusions: (1) long-time steady states in Markovian and non-Markovian regimes are different, resulting in the distinct TTCF, and (2) the time-dependent TTCF can reveal more information about the environment, rather than the traditional spectral function method.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced L\'evy flights of quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for L\'evy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.</description>

      <title>Transfer matrix approach to quantum systems subject to certain Lindblad evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving for the time evolution of a many particle system whose dynamics is governed by Lindblad equation is hard. We extend the use of the transfer matrix approach to a class of Lindblad equations that admit a closed hierarchy of two point correlators. An example that we treat is the XX spin chain, i.e., free fermions, subject to the local on-site dephasing, but can be extended to other Hermitian dissipators, e.g., non-local dephasing. We find a simple expression of the Green's function in the Laplace domain. The method can be used to get analytical results in the thermodynamic limit, for instance, to get the evolution of the magnetization density and to explicitly see the crossover between ballistic and diffusive behavior, or to show that the correlations between operators at distance $l$ decay with time as $1/t^{\lceil l/2 \rceil+1/2}$. It also provides a fast numerical method to determine the evolution of the density with a complexity scaling with the system size more favorably than in previous methods, easily allowing one to study systems with $\sim 10^6$ spins.</description>

      <title>Digital Zero-Noise Extrapolation with Quantum Circuit Unoptimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit unoptimization is an algorithm that transforms a quantum circuit into a different circuit that uses more gate operations while maintaining the same unitary transformation. We demonstrate that this method can implement digital zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a quantum error mitigation technique. By employing quantum circuit unoptimization as a form of circuit folding, noise can be systematically amplified. The key advantages of this approach are twofold. First, its ability to generate an exponentially increasing number of distinct circuit variants as the noise level is amplified, which allows noise averaging over many circuit instances with slightly different circuit structure which mitigates the effect of biased error propagation because of the significantly altered circuit structure from quantum circuit unoptimization, or highly biased local noise on a quantum processor. Second, quantum circuit unoptimization by design resists circuit simplification back to the original unmodified circuit, making it plausible to use ZNE in contexts where circuit compiler optimization is applied server-side. We evaluate the effectiveness of quantum circuit unoptimization as a noise-scaling method for ZNE in two test cases using depolarizing noise numerical simulations: random quantum volume circuits, where the observable is the heavy output probability, and QAOA circuits for the (unweighted) maximum cut problem on random 3-regular graphs, where the observable is the cut value. We show that using quantum circuit unoptimization to perform ZNE can approximately recover signal from noisy quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Is Productivity in Quantum Programming Equivalent to Expressiveness?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expressiveness of quantum programming languages plays a crucial role in the efficient and comprehensible representation of quantum algorithms. Unlike classical programming languages, which offer mature and well-defined abstraction mechanisms, quantum languages must integrate cognitively challenging concepts such as superposition, interference and entanglement while maintaining clarity and usability. However, identifying and characterizing differences in expressiveness between quantum programming paradigms remains an open area of study. Our work investigates the landscape of expressiveness through a comparative analysis of hosted quantum programming languages such as Qiskit, Cirq, Qrisp, and quAPL, and standalone languages including Q# and Qmod. We focused on evaluating how different quantum programming languages support the implementation of core quantum algorithms -- Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Grover -- using expressiveness metrics: Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), and Halstead Complexity (HC) metrics as proxies for developer productivity. Our findings suggest that different quantum programming paradigms offer distinct trade-offs between expressiveness and productivity, highlighting the importance of language design in quantum software development.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics model for Clifford random tensor networks and monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an exact mapping of Clifford (stabilizer) random tensor networks (RTNs) and monitored quantum circuits, onto a statistical mechanics model. With Haar unitaries, the fundamental degrees of freedom ('spins') are permutations because all operators commuting with the action of the unitaries on a tensor product arise from permutations of the tensor factors ('Schur-Weyl duality'). For unitaries restricted to the smaller Clifford group, the set of commuting operators, the 'commutant', forming the new 'spin' degrees of freedom, will be larger. We use the recent full characterization of this commutant by Gross et al., Comm. Math. Phys. 385, 1325 (2021), to construct the Clifford statistical mechanics models for on-site Hilbert space dimensions which are powers of a prime number $p$. We show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under a symmetry group involving orthogonal matrices with entries in the finite number field ${\bf F}_p$. This implies that the symmetry group, and consequently all universal properties of entanglement transitions in Clifford circuits and RTNs will in general depend on, and only on the prime $p$. We show that Clifford monitored circuits with on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p^M$ are described by percolation in the limits $d \to \infty$ at (a) $p=$ fixed but $M\to \infty$, and at (b) $M= 1$ but $p \to \infty$. In the limit (a) we calculate the effective central charge, and in the limit (b) we derive the following universal minimal cut entanglement entropy $S_A =(\sqrt{3}/\pi)\ln p \ln L_A$ for $d=p$ large at the transition. We verify those predictions numerically, and present extensive numerical results for critical exponents at the transition in monitored Clifford circuits for prime number on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p$ for a variety of different values of $p$, and find that they approach percolation values at large $p$.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Route to hyperchaos in quadratic optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperchaos is a qualitatively stronger form of chaos, in which several degrees of freedom contribute simultaneously to exponential divergence of small changes. A hyperchaotic dynamical system is therefore even more unpredictable than a chaotic one, and has a higher fractal dimension. While hyperchaos has been studied extensively over the last decades, only a few experimental systems are known to exhibit hyperchaotic dynamics. Here we introduce hyperchaos in the context of cavity optomechanics, in which light inside an optical resonator interacts with a suspended oscillating mass. We show that hyperchaos can arise in optomechanical systems with quadratic coupling and is well within reach of current experiments. We compute the two positive Lyapunov exponents, characteristic of hyperchaos, and independently verify the correlation dimension. We also identify a possible mechanism for the emergence of hyperchaos. As systems designed for high-precision measurements, optomechanical systems enable direct measurement of all four dynamical variables and therefore the full reconstruction of the hyperchaotic attractor. Our results may contribute to better understanding of nonlinear systems and the chaos-hyperchaos transition, and allow the study of hyperchaos in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>A novel quantum machine learning classifier to search for new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small. Consequently, future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as precision tests advance, rare processes with many final-state particles require consideration which demand the analysis of a vast number of observables. The high luminosity produces a large amount of experimental data spanning a large observable space, posing a significant data-processing challenge. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose quantum searching neighbor~(QSN) and variational QSN~(VQSN) algorithms to search for NP. The QSN is a classification algorithm. The VQSN introduces variation to the QSN to process classical data. As applications, we apply the (V)QSN in the phenomenological study of the NP at the Large Hadron Collider and muon colliders. The results indicate that the VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.</description>

      <title>Superfluorescent upconversion nanoparticles as an emerging second generation quantum technology material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superfluorescence (SF) in lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) is a room-temperature quantum phenomenon, first discovered in 2022. In a SF process, the many emissive lanthanide ions within a single UCNP are coherently coupled by an ultra-short (ns or fs) high-power excitation laser pulse. This leads to a superposition of excited emissive states which decrease the emissive lifetime of the UCNP by a factor proportional to the square of the number of lanthanide ions which are coherently coupled. This results in a dramatic decrease in UCNP emission lifetime from the microsecond regime to the nanosecond regime. Thus SF offers a tantalizing prospect to achieving superior upconversion photon flux in upconversion materials, with potential applications such as imaging and sensing. This perspective article contextualizes how SF-UCNPs can be regarded as a second generation quantum technology, and notes several challenges, opportunities, and open questions for the development of SF-UCNPs.</description>

      <title>Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We investigate bond-algebraic dualities in these systems and show that distinct module tensor categories $\mathcal{M}$ over the same braided fusion category $\mathcal{B}$ give rise to dual lattice models. This extends the 1+1d result that dualities in anyon chains are classified by module categories over fusion categories. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space, dual to the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ XXZ model on the honeycomb lattice, and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model, dual to a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ model with XXZ and Ising interactions. Unlike regular $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{B}$ fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} \neq \mathcal{B}$ can exhibit both 1-form and 0-form symmetries, including non-invertible ones.</description>

      <title>EDA-Q: Electronic Design Automation for Superconducting Quantum Chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15386v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) plays a crucial role in classical chip design and significantly influences the development of quantum chip design. However, traditional EDA tools cannot be directly applied to quantum chip design due to vast differences compared to the classical realm. Several EDA products tailored for quantum chip design currently exist, yet they only cover partial stages of the quantum chip design process instead of offering a fully comprehensive solution. Additionally, they often encounter issues such as limited automation, steep learning curves, challenges in integrating with actual fabrication processes, and difficulties in expanding functionality. To address these issues, we developed a full-stack EDA tool specifically for quantum chip design, called EDA-Q. The design workflow incorporates functionalities present in existing quantum EDA tools while supplementing critical design stages such as device mapping and fabrication process mapping, which users expect. EDA-Q utilizes a unique architecture to achieve exceptional scalability and flexibility. The integrated design mode guarantees algorithm compatibility with different chip components, while employing a specialized interactive processing mode to offer users a straightforward and adaptable command interface. Application examples demonstrate that EDA-Q significantly reduces chip design cycles, enhances automation levels, and decreases the time required for manual intervention. Multiple rounds of testing on the designed chip have validated the effectiveness of EDA-Q in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between accelerated probes in de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <title>Symmetrizing the Constraints -- Density Matrix Renormalization Group for Constrained Lattice Models</title>

Abstract: We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully {\it{implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators}}. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG for any lattice geometry wrapped around a cylinder with substantial circumference. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum and neural quantum states algorithms for the linear complementarity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising hybrid quantum-classical methods designed to leverage the computational advantages of quantum computing while mitigating the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Although VQAs have been demonstrated as proofs of concept, their practical utility in solving real-world problems -- and whether quantum-inspired classical algorithms can match their performance -- remains an open question. We present a novel application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) and its classical neural quantum states-based counterpart, the variational neural linear solver (VNLS), as key components within a minimum map Newton solver for a complementarity-based rigid body contact model. We demonstrate using the VNLS that our solver accurately simulates the dynamics of rigid spherical bodies during collision events. These results suggest that quantum and quantum-inspired linear algebra algorithms can serve as viable alternatives to standard linear algebra solvers for modeling certain physical systems.</description>
