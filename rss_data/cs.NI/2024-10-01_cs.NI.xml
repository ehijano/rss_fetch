      <title>Research on Enhancing C-V2X Communication via Risk-Level Transmission Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a protocol that optimizes message dissemination in C-V2X technology, crucial for advancing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) aimed at enhancing road safety. As vehicle density and velocity rise, the volume of data requiring communication significantly increases. By considering the risk levels that vehicles encounter and using inter-vehicle proximity as a key indicator of potential hazards, the proposed protocol prioritizes communication, allowing vehicles facing higher risks to transmit their messages first. Our results show that this prioritization effectively reduces the number of concurrent transmissions, leading to improved performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, latency, and lower probabilities of channel congestion and collision.</description>

      <title>AutoFlow: An Autoencoder-based Approach for IP Flow Record Compression with Minimal Impact on Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to compressing IP flow records using deep learning techniques, specifically autoencoders. Our method aims to significantly reduce data volume while maintaining the utility of the compressed data for downstream analysis tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on a large-scale, real-world network traffic dataset. The proposed autoencoder-based compression achieves a 3.28x reduction in data size while preserving 99.20% accuracy in a multi-class traffic classification task, compared to 99.77% accuracy with uncompressed data. This marginal decrease in performance is offset by substantial gains in storage efficiency and potential improvements in processing speed. Our method shows particular promise in distinguishing between various modern application protocols, including encrypted traffic from popular services. The implications of this work extend to more efficient network monitoring, real-time analysis in resource-constrained environments, and scalable network management solutions.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory of Hyper-simplex Fractal Network for Blockchain: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology holds promise for Web 3.0, but scalability remains a critical challenge. Here, we present a mathematical theory for a novel blockchain network topology based on fractal N-dimensional simplexes. This Hyper-simplex fractal network folds one-dimensional data blocks into geometric shapes, reflecting both underlying and overlaying network connectivities. Our approach offers near-infinite scalability, accommodating trillions of nodes while maintaining efficiency.
  We derive the mathematical foundations for generating and describing these network topologies, proving key properties such as node count, connectivity patterns, and fractal dimension. The resulting structure facilitates a hierarchical consensus mechanism and enables deterministic address mapping for rapid routing. This theoretical framework lays the groundwork for next-generation blockchain architectures, potentially revolutionizing large-scale decentralized systems. The Part I work was conducted between March and September 2024.</description>

      <title>What If We Had Used a Different App? Reliable Counterfactual KPI Analysis in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern wireless network architectures, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), the operation of the radio access network (RAN) is managed by applications, or apps for short, deployed at intelligent controllers. These apps are selected from a given catalog based on current contextual information. For instance, a scheduling app may be selected on the basis of current traffic and network conditions. Once an app is chosen and run, it is no longer possible to directly test the performance that would have been obtained with another app. This test, however, would be potentially valuable to monitor and optimize the network operation. With this goal in mind, this paper addresses the "what-if" problem of estimating the values of key performance indicators (KPIs) that would have been obtained if a different app had been implemented by the RAN. To this end, we propose a conformal-prediction-based counterfactual analysis method for wireless systems that provides reliable "error bars" for the estimated KPIs, containing the true KPIs with a user-defined probability, despite the inherent covariate shift between logged and test data. Experimental results for medium access control-layer apps and for physical-layer apps demonstrate the merits of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>QUIC is not Quick Enough over Fast Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QUIC is expected to be a game-changer in improving web application performance. In this paper, we conduct a systematic examination of QUIC's performance over high-speed networks. We find that over fast Internet, the UDP+QUIC+HTTP/3 stack suffers a data rate reduction of up to 45.2% compared to the TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 counterpart. Moreover, the performance gap between QUIC and HTTP/2 grows as the underlying bandwidth increases. We observe this issue on lightweight data transfer clients and major web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera), on different hosts (desktop, mobile), and over diverse networks (wired broadband, cellular). It affects not only file transfers, but also various applications such as video streaming (up to 9.8% video bitrate reduction) and web browsing. Through rigorous packet trace analysis and kernel- and user-space profiling, we identify the root cause to be high receiver-side processing overhead, in particular, excessive data packets and QUIC's user-space ACKs. We make concrete recommendations for mitigating the observed performance issues.</description>

Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single quasideterministic time-frequency heralded EPR-pair source, and develop a routing scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. We focus on fairness in entanglement distribution, and compare both the performance of various spectrum allocation schemes as well as their Jain index.</description>

      <title>Off-Path TCP Hijacking in Wi-Fi Networks: A Packet-Size Side Channel Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12716v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we unveil a fundamental side channel in Wi-Fi networks, specifically the observable frame size, which can be exploited by attackers to conduct TCP hijacking attacks. Despite the various security mechanisms (e.g., WEP and WPA2/WPA3) implemented to safeguard Wi-Fi networks, our study reveals that an off path attacker can still extract sufficient information from the frame size side channel to hijack the victim's TCP connection. Our side channel attack is based on two significant findings: (i) response packets (e.g., ACK and RST) generated by TCP receivers vary in size, and (ii) the encrypted frames containing these response packets have consistent and distinguishable sizes. By observing the size of the victim's encrypted frames, the attacker can detect and hijack the victim's TCP connections. We validate the effectiveness of this side channel attack through two case studies, i.e., SSH DoS and web traffic manipulation. Precisely, our attack can terminate the victim's SSH session in 19 seconds and inject malicious data into the victim's web traffic within 28 seconds. Furthermore, we conduct extensive measurements to evaluate the impact of our attack on real-world Wi-Fi networks. We test 30 popular wireless routers from 9 well-known vendors, and none of these routers can protect victims from our attack. Besides, we implement our attack in 80 real-world Wi-Fi networks and successfully hijack the victim's TCP connections in 75 (93.75%) evaluated Wi-Fi networks. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to the Wi-Fi Alliance and proposed several mitigation strategies to address this issue.</description>

      <title>Routing and Spectrum Allocation in Broadband Quantum Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. We focus on max-min fairness in entanglement distribution and compare the performance of various spectrum allocation schemes by examining the max-min and median number of EPR-pairs assigned by them, and the Jain index associated with this assignment. Since this presents an NP-hard problem, we identify two approximation algorithms that outperform others in minimum and mean EPR-pair rate distribution and are comparable to others in the Jain index. We also analyze how the network size and connectivity affect these metrics using Watts-Strogatz random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves high minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair rate, Jain index, and runtimes are considered.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sampling under Cost for Remote Estimation of the Wiener Process over a Channel with Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the optimal sampling of a Wiener process under sampling and transmission costs, with the samples being forwarded to a remote estimator over a channel with random IID delay. The goal of the estimator is to reconstruct an estimate of the real-time signal value from causally received samples. Our study focuses on the optimal online strategy for both sampling and transmission, aiming to minimize the mean square estimation error. We establish that the optimal strategy involves threshold policies for both sampling and transmission, and we derive the optimal thresholds. We utilize Lagrange relaxation and backward induction as our methodology, revealing the problem of minimizing estimation error, under the assumption that sampling and transmission times are independent of the observed Wiener process. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that the estimation error achieved by the optimal joint sampling and transmission policy is significantly lower than that of age-optimal sampling, zero-wait sampling, periodic sampling, and policies that optimize only the sampling times.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal pilot assignment in cell-free massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO systems are currently being considered as potential enablers of future (6G) technologies for wireless communications. By combining distributed processing and massive MIMO, they are expected to deliver improved user coverage and efficiency. A possible source of performance degradation in such systems is pilot contamination, which contributes to causing interference during uplink training and affects channel estimation negatively. Contamination occurs when the same pilot sequence is assigned to more than one user. This is in general inevitable, as the number of mutually orthogonal pilot sequences corresponds to only a fraction of the coherence interval. We introduce a new algorithm for pilot assignment and analyze its performance both from a theoretical perspective and in computational experiments. We show that it has an approximation ratio close to 1 for a plausibly large number of orthogonal pilot sequences, as well as low computational complexity under massive parallelism. We also show that, on average, it outperforms other methods in terms of per-user SINR and throughput on the uplink.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Security Analysis of Real-World Backend Deployments Speaking IoT-Focused Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, ranging from smart home assistants to health devices, are pervasive: Forecasts estimate their number to reach 29 billion by 2030. Understanding the security of their machine-to-machine communication is crucial. Prior work focused on identifying devices' vulnerabilities or proposed protocol-specific solutions. Instead, we investigate the security of backends speaking IoT protocols, that is, the backbone of the IoT ecosystem.
  We focus on three real-world protocols for our large-scale analysis: MQTT, CoAP, and XMPP. We gather a dataset of over 337,000 backends, augment it with geographical and provider data, and perform non-invasive active measurements to investigate three major security threats: information leakage, weak authentication, and denial of service. Our results provide quantitative evidence of a problematic immaturity in the IoT ecosystem. Among other issues, we find that 9.44% backends expose information, 30.38% CoAP-speaking backends are vulnerable to denial of service attacks, and 99.84% of MQTT- and XMPP-speaking backends use insecure transport protocols (only 0.16% adopt TLS, of which 70.93% adopt a vulnerable version).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Automotive User Experience with Dynamic Service Orchestration for Software Defined Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for dynamic behaviors in automotive use cases, Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) have emerged as a promising solution by bringing dynamic onboard service management capabilities. While users may request a wide range of services during vehicle operation, background tasks such as cooperative Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services can activate on-the-fly in response to real-time road conditions. In this dynamic environment, the efficient allocation of onboard resources becomes a complex challenge, in order to meet mixed-criticality onboard Quality-of-Service (QoS) network requirements while ensuring an optimal user experience. Additionally, the ever-evolving real-time network connectivity and computational availability conditions further complicate the process. In this context, we present a dynamic resource-based onboard service orchestration algorithm that considers real-time in-vehicle and V2X network health, along with onboard resource constraints, to select degraded modes for onboard applications and maximize user experience. To enable dynamic orchestration, we introduce the concept of Automotive eXperience Integrity Level (AXIL) which expresses a runtime priority for non-safety-critical applications. This algorithm produces near-optimal solutions while significantly reducing execution time compared to straightforward methods as demonstrated by simulation results. With this approach, we aim to enable efficient onboard execution for a user experience-focused service orchestration.</description>
