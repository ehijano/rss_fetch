      <title>Comment on the "Electric Power Generation from Earth's Rotation through its Own Magnetic Field"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The suggestion made by C. F. Chyba and K. P. Hand about electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field is intriguing [1, 2]. Here, we reanalyze the theoretical arguments for their conclusion, especially those presented in [1]. The model that they consider, is a magnetic cylindrical shell moving with low velocity $v$ in the $y$ direction at a right angle to the direction of the Earth's magnetic field $B_\infty$. We first focus on one of the electromagnetic boundary conditions for moving dielectric boundaries (a topic not dealt with in [1, 2]), and obtain therefrom a result at variance with the main result in the mentioned papers. Therefore, we have to conclude that their result does not satisfy this boundary condition. Moreover, by a simple calculation, we observe that a displacement of the shell in the mentioned $y$ direction, does not involve any expenditure of external work. A process involving dissipation of energy as envisaged in [1, 2] thus appears to be forbidden for energy conservation reasons.</description>

      <title>Resultant Delta-V Estimation from EDR Data Recorded in Automobiles that have Undergone Impact-Induced Yaw Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several references in the public literature that discuss the effect impact-induced yaw motion has on the measurement of acceleration, vis-\`a-vis accelerometers, in automobile collisions [1], [2], [3], [4]. It is well-understood that direct integration of accelerometer data does not provide accurate velocity components for a vehicle undergoing appreciable rotational motion whether the accelerometers are installed at the vehicle center of gravity or not. Direct integration of accelerometer data is, nonetheless, how event data recorders (EDRs) calculate Delta-V components and care must be taken on the part of the analyst in interpreting this information when the vehicle from which it came was known to have experienced significant yaw motion. As such, in this paper we set out to: (1) examine whether the correct resultant Delta-V at the center of gravity can be determined from the directly-integrated EDR Delta-V components, and (2) to assess what useful Delta-V information can be readily gotten from EDRs that are typically not installed at the vehicle center of gravity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Time-Coarse Graining via an Operator Cumulant Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for deriving effective dynamics from arbitrary time-dependent generators, based on a systematic operator cumulant expansion. Unlike traditional approaches, which typically assume periodic or adiabatic driving, our method applies to systems with general time dependencies and is compatible with any dynamics generated by a linear operator -- Hamiltonian or not, quantum or classical, open or closed. This enables modeling of systems exhibiting strong modulation, dissipation, or non-adiabatic effects. Our approach unifies Hamiltonian techniques such as Lie-transform Perturbation Theory (LPT) with averaging-based methods like Time-Coarse Graining (TCG), revealing their structural equivalence through the lens of generalized cumulants. It also clarifies how non-Hamiltonian terms naturally emerge from averaging procedures, even in closed systems. We illustrate the power and flexibility of the method by analyzing a damped, parametrically driven Kapitza pendulum, a system beyond the reach of standard tools, demonstrating how accurate effective equations can be derived across a wide range of regimes.</description>
