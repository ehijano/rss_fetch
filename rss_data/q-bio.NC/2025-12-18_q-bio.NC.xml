      <title>The Role of Affect and Priors in the Generation of Hallucinations in Early Psychosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Stress and negative affect play significant roles in developing psychosis. Bayesian analyses applied to the conditioned hallucinations (CH) task suggest that hallucinations arise when maladaptive prior beliefs outweigh sensory evidence. Prior weighting is linked to hallucination severity, yet the nature of these priors remains unclear. Negative affect may influence the strength of maladaptive priors. We hypothesized that, under stress, participants will show increased CH rates and prior weighting, with this effect more pronounced in patients.
  Methods: This study employs a modified CH task using valenced linguistic stimuli and stress and non-stress affective manipulations. The sample for this pilot study included those at risk for psychosis and patients with first episode psychosis (N=12) and healthy controls (N=15). The objective of this study was first to validate this affective version of the CH task and then to demonstrate an effect of affect on CH rates and prior weighting.
  Results: Replicating past results, patients had higher CH rates (b = 0.061, p &lt; 0.001) and prior weighting (b = 0.097, p &lt; 0.001) for session 1 compared to controls (n=15) across conditions. Further, runs with stress manipulations had higher prior weighting across patients and controls compared to runs with non-stress manipulations (b = 0.054, p = 0.033).
  Conclusions: This study validates this affective version of the CH task and provides preliminary evidence of a relationship between affective state and prior weighting. Future work will be aimed at confirming and extending these findings, with the objective of developing biomarkers of early psychosis.

      <title>When sufficiency is insufficient: the functional information bottleneck for identifying probabilistic neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neural basis of probabilistic computations remains elusive, even amidst growing evidence that humans and other animals track their uncertainty. Recent work has proposed that probabilistic representations arise naturally in task-optimized neural networks trained without explicitly probabilistic inductive biases. However, prior work has lacked clear criteria for distinguishing probabilistic representations, those that perform transformations characteristic of probabilistic computation, from heuristic neural codes that merely reformat inputs. We propose a novel information bottleneck framework, the functional information bottleneck (fIB), that crucially evaluates a neural representation based not only on its statistical sufficiency but also on its minimality, allowing us to disambiguate heuristic from probabilistic coding. To demonstrate the power of this framework, we study a variety of task-optimized neural networks that had been suggested to develop probabilistic representations in earlier work: networks trained to perform static inference tasks (such as cue combination and coordinate transformation) or dynamic state estimation tasks (Kalman filtering). In contrast to earlier claims, our minimality requirement reveals that probabilistic representations fail to emerge in these networks: they do not develop minimal codes of Bayesian posteriors in their hidden layer activities, and instead rely on heuristic input recoding. Therefore, it remains an open question under which conditions truly probabilistic representations emerge in neural networks. More generally, our work provides a stringent framework for identifying probabilistic neural codes. Thus, it lays the foundation for systematically examining whether, how, and which posteriors are represented in neural circuits during complex decision-making tasks.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on electrogastrography using low-cost hardware and open-source software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrogastrography is the recording of changes in electric potential caused by the stomach's pacemaker region, typically through several cutaneous sensors placed on the abdomen. It is a worthwhile technique in medical and psychological research, but also relatively niche. Here we present a tutorial on the acquisition and analysis of the human electrogastrogram. Because dedicated equipment and software can be prohibitively expensive, we demonstrate how data can be acquired using a low-cost OpenBCI Ganglion amplifier. We also present a processing pipeline that minimises attrition, which is particularly helpful for low-cost equipment but also applicable to top-of-the-line hardware. Our approach comprises outlier rejection, frequency filtering, movement filtering, and noise reduction using independent component analysis. Where traditional approaches include a subjective step in which only one channel is manually selected for further analysis, our pipeline recomposes the electrogastrogram from all recorded channels after automatic rejection of nuisance components. The main benefits of this approach are reduced attrition, retention of data from all recorded channels, and reduced influence of researcher bias. In addition to our tutorial on the method, we offer a proof-of-principle in which our approach leads to reduced data rejection compared to established methods. We aimed to describe each step in sufficient detail to be implemented in any programming language. In addition, we made an open-source Python package freely available for ease of use.</description>

      <title>Human-computer interactions predict mental health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable assessments of mental illness remain a critical roadblock toward accessible and equitable care. Here, we show that everyday human-computer interactions encode mental health with state-of-the-art biomarker precision. We introduce MAILA, a MAchine-learning framework for Inferring Latent mental states from digital Activity. We trained MAILA on 20,000 cursor and touchscreen recordings labelled with 1.3 million mental-health self-reports collected from 9,000 participants. The dataset includes 2,000 individuals assessed longitudinally, 1,500 diagnosed with depression, and 500 with obsessive-compulsive disorder. MAILA tracks dynamic mental states along three orthogonal dimensions, identifies individuals living with mental illness, and achieves near-ceiling accuracy when predicting group-level mental health. By extracting non-verbal signatures of psychological function that have so far remained untapped, MAILA represents a key step toward scalable digital phenotyping and foundation models for mental health.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Excessive Anesthesia Depth Using EEG {\alpha}-Spindle Dynamics and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives. Accurately predicting transitions to anesthetic drugs overdosage is a critical challenge in general anesthesia as it requires the identification of EEG indicators relevant for anticipating the evolution of the depth of anesthesia. Methods. In this study, we introduce a real-time, data-driven framework based on alpha spindle dynamics extracted from frontal EEG recordings. Using Empirical Mode Decomposition, we segment transient alpha spindle events and extract statistical features such as amplitude, duration, frequency, and suppression intervals. We apply these features to train a Light Gradient Boosting Machine, LGBM, classifier on a clinical EEG dataset spanning induction, maintenance, and emergence phases of general anesthesia. Results. Our model accurately classifies anesthesia phases with over 80 percent accuracy and anticipates the onset of isoelectric suppression, a marker of anesthetic drugs overdosage, with 96 percent accuracy up to 90 seconds in advance. Conclusion. The spindle-based metrics provides a non-invasive, interpretable, and predictive approach. This real-time method can be used to forecast unintentional anesthetic drugs overdosage, enabling proactive anesthesia management based solely on EEG signals. Significance. This new method is the first to provide a way to prevent too deep anesthesia and its consequence for the well-being of patients after the recovery from anesthesia.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability for dense patterns in discrete attractor neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.</description>
