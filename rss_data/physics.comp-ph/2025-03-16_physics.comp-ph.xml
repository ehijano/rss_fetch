      <title>Fourier Neural Operator based surrogates for $CO_2$ storage in realistic geologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop surrogate models for accelerating decision making processes associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Selection of sub-surface $CO_2$ storage sites often necessitates expensive and involved simulations of $CO_2$ flow fields. Here, we develop a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based model for real-time, high-resolution simulation of $CO_2$ plume migration. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset generated from realistic subsurface parameters and offers $O(10^5)$ computational acceleration with minimal sacrifice in prediction accuracy. We also explore super-resolution experiments to improve the computational cost of training the FNO based models. Additionally, we present various strategies for improving the reliability of predictions from the model, which is crucial while assessing actual geological sites. This novel framework, based on NVIDIA's Modulus library, will allow rapid screening of sites for CCS. The discussed workflows and strategies can be applied to other energy solutions like geothermal reservoir modeling and hydrogen storage. Our work scales scientific machine learning models to realistic 3D systems that are more consistent with real-life subsurface aquifers/reservoirs, paving the way for next-generation digital twins for subsurface CCS applications.</description>

      <title>Utilizing rate-independent hysteresis for analog computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical systems exhibiting hysteresis are increasingly being used in neuromorphic and in-memory computing research. Generally, the resistance switching of devices with rate-independent hysteresis are being investigated for their use as trainable weights in neural networks, whereas the dynamics of devices showing rate-dependent hysteresis are being investigate for their potential as nodes in, for example in reservoir computing systems. In our work we instead show the computing potential of a simple rate-independent hysteresis system. We show that by driving a system of only two linear branches with time-multiplexed inputs it is possible to generate nonlinear transforms and perform timeseries prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Basic stability tests of machine learning potentials for molecular simulations in computational drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network potentials trained on quantum-mechanical data can calculate molecular interactions with relatively high speed and accuracy. However, neural network potentials might exhibit instabilities, nonphysical behavior, or lack accuracy. To assess the reliability of neural network potentials, a series of tests is conducted during model training, in the gas phase, and in the condensed phase. The testing procedure is performed for eight in-house neural network potentials based on the ANI-2x dataset, using both the ANI-2x and MACE architectures. This allows an evaluation of the effect of the model architecture on its performance. We also perform stability tests of the publicly available neural network potentials ANI-2x, ANI-1ccx, MACE-OFF23, and AIMNet2. A normal mode analysis of 14 simple benchmark molecules revealed that the small MACE-OFF23 model shows large deviations from the reference quantum-mechanical energy surface. Also, some MACE models with a reduced number of parameters failed to produce stable molecular dynamics simulations in the gas phase, and all MACE models exhibit unfavorable behavior during steric clashes. The published ANI-2x and one of the in-house MACE models are not able to reproduce the structure of liquid water at ambient conditions, forming an amorphous solid phase instead. The ANI-1ccx model shows nonphysical additional energy minima in bond length and bond angle space, which caused a phase transition to an amorphous solid. Out of all 13 considered public and in-house models, only one in-house model based on the ANI-2x B97-3c dataset shows better agreement with the experimental radial distribution function of water than the simple molecular mechanics TIP3P model. This shows that great care must be taken during model training and when selecting a neural network potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>3D Multiphase Heterogeneous Microstructure Generation Using Conditional Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to generate 3D multiphase microstructures on-demand with targeted attributes can greatly accelerate the design of advanced materials. Here, we present a conditional latent diffusion model (LDM) framework that rapidly synthesizes high-fidelity 3D multiphase microstructures tailored to user specifications. Using this approach, we generate diverse two-phase and three-phase microstructures at high resolution (volumes of $128 \times 128 \times 64$ voxels, representing $&gt;10^6$ voxels each) within seconds, overcoming the scalability and time limitations of traditional simulation-based methods. Key design features, such as desired volume fractions and tortuosities, are incorporated as controllable inputs to guide the generative process, ensuring that the output structures meet prescribed statistical and topological targets. Moreover, the framework predicts corresponding manufacturing (processing) parameters for each generated microstructure, helping to bridge the gap between digital microstructure design and experimental fabrication. While demonstrated on organic photovoltaic (OPV) active-layer morphologies, the flexible architecture of our approach makes it readily adaptable to other material systems and microstructure datasets. By combining computational efficiency, adaptability, and experimental relevance, this framework addresses major limitations of existing methods and offers a powerful tool for accelerated materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Bridging Machine Learning and Cosmological Simulations: Using Neural Operators to emulate Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational expense of solving non-equilibrium chemistry equations in astrophysical simulations poses a significant challenge, particularly in high-resolution, large-scale cosmological models. In this work, we explore the potential of machine learning, specifically Neural Operators, to emulate the Grackle chemistry solver, which is widely used in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Neural Operators offer a mesh-free, data-driven approach to approximate solutions to coupled ordinary differential equations governing chemical evolution, gas cooling, and heating. We construct and train multiple Neural Operator architectures (DeepONet variants) using a dataset derived from cosmological simulations to optimize accuracy and efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the trained models accurately reproduce Grackle's outputs with an average error of less than 0.6 dex in most cases, though deviations increase in highly dynamic chemical environments. Compared to Grackle, the machine learning models provide computational speedups of up to a factor of six in large-scale simulations, highlighting their potential for reducing computational bottlenecks in astrophysical modeling. However, challenges remain, particularly in iterative applications where accumulated errors can lead to numerical instability. Additionally, the performance of these machine learning models is constrained by their need for well-represented training datasets and the limited extrapolation capabilities of deep learning methods. While promising, further development is required for Neural Operator-based emulators to be fully integrated into astrophysical simulations. Future work should focus on improving stability over iterative timesteps and optimizing implementations for hardware acceleration. This study provides an initial step toward the broader adoption of machine learning approaches in astrophysical chemistry solvers.</description>

      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the shock, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>A pseudo-dynamic phase-field model for brittle fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enforcement of global energy conservation in phase-field fracture simulations has been an open problem for the last 25 years. Specifically, the occurrence of unstable fracture is accompanied by a loss in total potential energy, which suggests a violation of the energy conservation law. This phenomenon can occur even with purely quasi-static, displacement-driven loading conditions, where finite crack growth arises from an infinitesimal increase in load. While such behavior is typically seen in crack nucleation, it may also occur in other situations. Initial efforts to enforce energy conservation involved backtracking schemes based on global minimization, however in recent years it has become clearer that unstable fracture, being an inherently dynamic phenomenon, cannot be adequately resolved within a purely quasi-static framework. Despite this, it remains uncertain whether transitioning to a fully dynamic framework would sufficiently address the issue. In this work, we propose a pseudo-dynamic framework designed to enforce energy balance without relying on global minimization. This approach incorporates dynamic effects heuristically into an otherwise quasi-static model, allowing us to bypass solving the full dynamic linear momentum equation. It offers the flexibility to simulate crack evolution along a spectrum, ranging from full energy conservation at one extreme to maximal energy loss at the other. Using data from recent experiments, we demonstrate that our framework can closely replicate experimental load-displacement curves, achieving results that are unattainable with classical phase-field models.</description>

      <title>DiracBilinears.jl: A package for computing Dirac bilinears in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DiracBilinears.jl is a Julia package for computing Dirac bilinears, which are fundamental physical quantities of electrons in relativistic quantum theory, using first-principles calculations for solids. In relativistic quantum theory, 16 independent bilinears can be defined using the four-component Dirac field. We take the non-relativistic limit for the bilinears, which corresponds to the $1/m$ expansion, and focus on the low-energy physics typically considered in condensed matter physics. This package can evaluate the spatial distributions and Wannier matrix elements of the Dirac bilinears in solids quantitatively by connecting to the external first-principles calculation packages, including Quantum ESPRESSO, Wannier90, and wan2respack.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Diffuse Interface Method for Multiphase Flow Simulations Across All Mach Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper enhances the Diffuse Interface Method (DIM) for simulating compressible multiphase flows across all Mach numbers by addressing the accuracy challenges posed at low Mach regimes. A correction to the Riemann solver is introduced, designed to mitigate excessive numerical diffusion while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. The validity of this correction is established through rigorous asymptotic analysis of the governing equations and their discrete counterparts. The proposed correction is implemented within a six-equation model framework with instantaneous relaxation using an HLLC-type solver. Numerical test cases demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the approach in capturing multiphase flow dynamics across a wide range of Mach numbers.</description>

      <title>Learning to reset in target search problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target search problems are central to a wide range of fields, from biological foraging to the optimization algorithms. Recently, the ability to reset the search has been shown to significantly improve the searcher's efficiency. However, the optimal resetting strategy depends on the specific properties of the search problem and can often be challenging to determine. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to train agents capable of optimizing their search efficiency in environments by learning how to reset. First, we validate the approach in a well-established benchmark: the Brownian search with resetting. There, RL agents consistently recover strategies closely resembling the sharp resetting distribution, known to be optimal in this scenario. We then extend the framework by allowing agents to control not only when to reset, but also their spatial dynamics through turning actions. In this more complex setting, the agents discover strategies that adapt both resetting and turning to the properties of the environment, outperforming the proposed benchmarks. These results demonstrate how reinforcement learning can serve both as an optimization tool and a mechanism for uncovering new, interpretable strategies in stochastic search processes with resetting.</description>

      <title>Ions at electrochemical interfaces: from explicit to implicit molecular solvent descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between electronic screening inside a metal and screening by a polar molecular solvent, focusing on their impact on the charge induced by an ion and the solvent structure at the interface. To that end, we consider atomistically resolved electrodes within the Thomas-Fermi model of screening and describe the molecular solvent either explicitly via classical molecular dynamics or implicitly using Molecular Density Functional Theory (MDFT). Specifically, we examine the effect of screening by tuning the Thomas-Fermi screening length $l_\text{TF}$, the ion charge by considering Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ and the solvent nature by studying water and acetonitrile. Consistently with our previous findings without solvent, $l_\text{TF}$ significantly affects the charge distribution inside the metal. However, $l_\text{TF}$ has no significant impact on the interfacial solvent structure, suggesting that its effect on the charge distribution induced inside the metal by the ion is essentially due to how the metal responds to the (same) external charge distribution, including the solvent, even though the coupling between both sides of the interface may play a secondary role. Furthermore, MDFT accurately reproduces fine details of the interfacial solvent structure around the ion at a fraction of the computational cost of MD simulations. These results highlight the relevance of MDFT as a powerful tool to model electrochemical systems at the molecular level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An excitonic insulator$^{1,2}$ (EI) is a correlated many-body state of electron-hole pairs, potentially leading to high-temperature condensate and superfluidity$^{3-7}$. Despite ever-growing experiments suggesting possible EI states in various materials, direct proofs remain elusive and debated. Here we address the problem by introducing an ab initio methodology, enabling the parameter-free determination of electron-hole pairing order parameter and single-particle excitations within a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type formalism. Our calculations on monolayer 1T'-MoS$_{2}$$^{8,9}$ reveals that it is an unconventional EI with a transition temperature ~900K, breaking spontaneously the crystal's inversion, rotation, and mirror symmetries, while maintaining odd parity and unitarity. We identify several telltale spectroscopic signatures emergent in this EI phase that distinguish it from the band insulator (BI) phase, exemplified with a giant $\textbf{k}$-dependent $\textit{p}$-wave spin texture.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation With An Integral-Form Ensemble Square-Root Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geoscientific applications of ensemble Kalman filters face several computational challenges arising from the high dimensionality of the forecast covariance matrix, particularly when this matrix incorporates localization. For square-root filters, updating the perturbations of the ensemble members from their mean is an especially challenging step, one which generally requires approximations that introduce a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. This paper describes an ensemble square-root filter which achieves a favorable trade-off between these factors by discretizing an integral representation of the Kalman filter update equations, and in doing so, avoids a direct evaluation of the matrix square-root in the perturbation update stage. This algorithm, which we call InFo-ESRF (``Integral-Form Ensemble Square-Root Filter''), is parallelizable and uses a preconditioned Krylov method to update perturbations to a high degree of accuracy. Through numerical experiments with both a Gaussian forecast model and a multi-layer Lorenz-type system, we demonstrate that InFo-ESRF is competitive or superior to several existing localized square-root filters in terms of accuracy and cost.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Imaging Framework Combining CNN and Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Full-Inverse Tomography: A Case Study in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a highly ill-posed inverse problem, with the challenge of reconstructing internal conductivities using only boundary voltage measurements. Although Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown potential in solving inverse problems, existing approaches are limited in their applicability to EIT, as they often rely on impractical prior knowledge and assumptions that cannot be satisfied in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage hybrid learning framework that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PINNs. This framework integrates data-driven and model-driven paradigms, blending supervised and unsupervised learning to reconstruct conductivity distributions while ensuring adherence to the underlying physical laws, thereby overcoming the constraints of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Fighting Newtonian Noise with Gradient-Based Optimization at the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Newtonian noise in gravitational wave detectors originates from density fluctuations in the adjacency of the interferometer mirrors. At the Einstein Telescope, this noise source is expected to be dominant for low frequencies. Its impact is proposed to be reduced with the help of an array of seismometers that will be placed around the interferometer endpoints. We reformulate and implement the problem of finding the optimal seismometer positions in a differentiable way. We then explore the use of first-order gradient-based optimization for the design of the seismometer array for 1 Hz and 10 Hz and compare its performance and computational cost to two metaheuristic algorithms. For 1 Hz, we introduce a constraint term to prevent unphysical optimization results in the gradient-based method. In general, we find that it is an efficient strategy to initialize the gradient-based optimizer with a fast metaheuristic algorithm. For a small number of seismometers, this strategy results in approximately the same noise reduction as with the metaheuristics. For larger numbers of seismometers, gradient-based optimization outperforms the two metaheuristics by a factor of 2.25 for the faster of the two and a factor of 1.4 for the other one, which is significantly outperformed by gradient-based optimization in terms of computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: A multidimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future developments will extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>DGNN: A Neural PDE Solver Induced by Discontinuous Galerkin Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for the Discontinuous Galerkin-induced Neural Network (DGNN), inspired by the Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin Method (IPDGM). In this approach, the trial space consists of piecewise neural network space defined over the computational domain, while the test function space is composed of piecewise polynomials. We demonstrate the advantages of DGNN in terms of accuracy and training efficiency across several numerical examples, including stationary and time-dependent problems. Specifically, DGNN easily handles high perturbations, discontinuous solutions, and complex geometric domains.</description>
