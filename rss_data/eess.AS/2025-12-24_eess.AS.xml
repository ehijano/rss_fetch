      <title>ASK: Adaptive Self-improving Knowledge Framework for Audio Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm for Audio-Text Retrieval (ATR) relies on mini-batch-based contrastive learning. This process, however, is inherently limited by what we formalize as the Gradient Locality Bottleneck (GLB), which structurally prevents models from leveraging out-of-batch knowledge and thus impairs fine-grained and long-tail learning. While external knowledge-enhanced methods can alleviate the GLB, we identify a critical, unaddressed side effect: the Representation-Drift Mismatch (RDM), where a static knowledge base becomes progressively misaligned with the evolving model, turning guidance into noise. To address this dual challenge, we propose the Adaptive Self-improving Knowledge (ASK) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution. ASK breaks the GLB via multi-grained knowledge injection, systematically mitigates RDM through dynamic knowledge refinement, and introduces a novel adaptive reliability weighting scheme to ensure consistent knowledge contributes to optimization. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with superior, state-of-the-art performance justify the efficacy of our proposed ASK framework.</description>

      <title>SpatialNet with Binaural Loss Function for Correcting Binaural Signal Matching Outputs under Head Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaural reproduction is gaining increasing attention with the rise of devices such as virtual reality headsets, smart glasses, and head-tracked headphones. Achieving accurate binaural signals with these systems is challenging, as they often employ arbitrary microphone arrays with limited spatial resolution. The Binaural Signals Matching with Magnitude Least-Squares (BSM-MagLS) method was developed to address limitations of earlier BSM formulations, improving reproduction at high frequencies and under head rotation. However, its accuracy still degrades as head rotation increases, resulting in spatial and timbral artifacts, particularly when the virtual listener's ear moves farther from the nearest microphones. In this work, we propose the integration of deep learning with BSM-MagLS to mitigate these degradations. A post-processing framework based on the SpatialNet network is employed, leveraging its ability to process spatial information effectively and guided by both signal-level loss and a perceptually motivated binaural loss derived from a theoretical model of human binaural hearing. The effectiveness of the approach is investigated in a simulation study with a six-microphone semicircular array, showing its ability to perform robustly across head rotations. These findings are further studied in a listening experiment across different reverberant acoustic environments and head rotations, demonstrating that the proposed framework effectively mitigates BSM-MagLS degradations and provides robust correction across substantial head rotations.</description>

      <title>QuarkAudio Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many existing audio processing and generation models rely on task-specific architectures, resulting in fragmented development efforts and limited extensibility. It is therefore promising to design a unified framework capable of handling multiple tasks, while providing robust instruction and audio understanding and high-quality audio generation. This requires a compatible paradigm design, a powerful backbone, and a high-fidelity audio reconstruction module. To meet these requirements, this technical report introduces QuarkAudio, a decoder-only autoregressive (AR) LM-based generative framework that unifies multiple tasks. The framework includes a unified discrete audio tokenizer, H-Codec, which incorporates self-supervised learning (SSL) representations into the tokenization and reconstruction process. We further propose several improvements to H-Codec, such as a dynamic frame-rate mechanism and extending the audio sampling rate to 48 kHz. QuarkAudio unifies tasks by using task-specific conditional information as the conditioning sequence of the decoder-only LM, and predicting discrete target audio tokens in an AR manner. The framework supports a wide range of audio processing and generation tasks, including speech restoration (SR), target speaker extraction (TSE), speech separation (SS), voice conversion (VC), and language-queried audio source separation (LASS). In addition, we extend downstream tasks to universal free-form audio editing guided by natural language instructions (including speech semantic editing and audio event editing). Experimental results show that H-Codec achieves high-quality audio reconstruction with a low frame rate, improving both the efficiency and performance of downstream audio generation, and that QuarkAudio delivers competitive or comparable performance to state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across multiple tasks.</description>

      <title>LP-CFM: Perceptual Invariance-Aware Conditional Flow Matching for Speech Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a new perspective on speech modeling by incorporating perceptual invariances such as amplitude scaling and temporal shifts. Conventional generative formulations often treat each dataset sample as a fixed representative of the target distribution. From a generative standpoint, however, such samples are only one among many perceptually equivalent variants within the true speech distribution. To address this, we propose Linear Projection Conditional Flow Matching (LP-CFM), which models targets as projection-aligned elongated Gaussians along perceptually equivalent variants. We further introduce Vector Calibrated Sampling (VCS) to keep the sampling process aligned with the line-projection path. In neural vocoding experiments across model sizes, data scales, and sampling steps, the proposed approach consistently improves over the conventional optimal transport CFM, with particularly strong gains in low-resource and few-step scenarios. These results highlight the potential of LP-CFM and VCS to provide more robust and perceptually grounded generative modeling of speech.</description>

      <title>DDAVS: Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment for Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

      <title>Fun-Audio-Chat Technical Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.</description>

      <title>Spectral or spatial? Leveraging both for speaker extraction in challenging data conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust multi-channel speaker extraction algorithm designed to handle inaccuracies in reference information. While existing approaches often rely solely on either spatial or spectral cues to identify the target speaker, our method integrates both sources of information to enhance robustness. A key aspect of our approach is its emphasis on stability, ensuring reliable performance even when one of the features is degraded or misleading. Given a noisy mixture and two potentially unreliable cues, a dedicated network is trained to dynamically balance their contributions-or disregard the less informative one when necessary. We evaluate the system under challenging conditions by simulating inference-time errors using a simple direction of arrival (DOA) estimator and a noisy spectral enrollment process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully extracts the desired speaker even in the presence of substantial reference inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Aliasing-Free Neural Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural vocoders and codecs reconstruct waveforms from acoustic representations, which directly impact the audio quality. Among existing methods, upsampling-based time-domain models are superior in both inference speed and synthesis quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Still, despite their success in producing perceptually natural sound, their synthesis fidelity remains limited due to the aliasing artifacts brought by the inadequately designed model architectures. In particular, the unconstrained nonlinear activation generates an infinite number of harmonics that exceed the Nyquist frequency, resulting in ``folded-back'' aliasing artifacts. The widely used upsampling layer, ConvTranspose, copies the mirrored low-frequency parts to fill the empty high-frequency region, resulting in ``mirrored'' aliasing artifacts. Meanwhile, the combination of its inherent periodicity and the mirrored DC bias also brings ``tonal artifact,'' resulting in constant-frequency ringing. This paper aims to solve these issues from a signal processing perspective. Specifically, we apply oversampling and anti-derivative anti-aliasing to the activation function to obtain its anti-aliased form, and replace the problematic ConvTranspose layer with resampling to avoid the ``tonal artifact'' and eliminate aliased components. Based on our proposed anti-aliased modules, we introduce Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec, and release high-quality pre-trained checkpoints to facilitate audio generation research. We build a test signal benchmark to illustrate the effectiveness of the anti-aliased modules, and conduct experiments on speech, singing voice, music, and audio to validate our proposed models. Experimental results confirm that our lightweight Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec models can easily outperform existing systems on singing voice, music, and audio, while achieving comparable performance on speech.</description>

      <title>TAVID: Text-Driven Audio-Visual Interactive Dialogue Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.</description>

      <title>SpidR: Learning Fast and Stable Linguistic Units for Spoken Language Models Without Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in generative audio models have enabled high-fidelity environmental sound synthesis, raising serious concerns for audio security. The ESDD 2026 Challenge therefore addresses environmental sound deepfake detection under unseen generators (Track 1) and black-box low-resource detection (Track 2) conditions. We propose EnvSSLAM-FFN, which integrates a frozen SSLAM self-supervised encoder with a lightweight FFN back-end. To effectively capture spoofing artifacts under severe data imbalance, we fuse intermediate SSLAM representations from layers 4-9 and adopt a class-weighted training objective. Experimental results show that the proposed system consistently outperforms the official baselines on both tracks, achieving Test Equal Error Rates (EERs) of 1.20% and 1.05%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Low-Resource Domain Adaptation for Speech LLMs via Text-Only Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance, with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain adaptation of ASR.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bottleneck in Sinusoidal Representation Networks: Noise is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work identifies and attempts to address a fundamental limitation of implicit neural representations with sinusoidal activation. The fitting error of SIRENs is highly sensitive to the target frequency content and to the choice of initialization. In extreme cases, this sensitivity leads to a spectral bottleneck that can result in a zero-valued output. This phenomenon is characterized by analyzing the evolution of activation spectra and the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) during the training process. An unfavorable distribution of energy across frequency modes was noted to give rise to this failure mode. Furthermore, the effect of Gaussian perturbations applied to the baseline uniformly initialized weights is examined, showing how these perturbations influence activation spectra and the NTK eigenbasis of SIREN. Overall, initialization emerges as a central factor governing the evolution of SIRENs, indicating the need for adaptive, target-aware strategies as the target length increases and fine-scale detail becomes essential. The proposed weight initialization scheme (WINNER) represents a simple ad hoc step in this direction and demonstrates that fitting accuracy can be significantly improved by modifying the spectral profile of network activations through a target-aware initialization. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on audio fitting tasks and yields notable improvements in image fitting tasks.</description>

Abstract: We propose DeepASA, a multi-purpose model for auditory scene analysis that performs multi-input multi-output (MIMO) source separation, dereverberation, sound event detection (SED), audio classification, and direction-of-arrival estimation (DoAE) within a unified framework. DeepASA is designed for complex auditory scenes where multiple, often similar, sound sources overlap in time and move dynamically in space. To achieve robust and consistent inference across tasks, we introduce an object-oriented processing (OOP) strategy. This approach encapsulates diverse auditory features into object-centric representations and refines them through a chain-of-inference (CoI) mechanism. The pipeline comprises a dynamic temporal kernel-based feature extractor, a transformer-based aggregator, and an object separator that yields per-object features. These features feed into multiple task-specific decoders. Our object-centric representations naturally resolve the parameter association ambiguity inherent in traditional track-wise processing. However, early-stage object separation can lead to failure in downstream ASA tasks. To address this, we implement temporal coherence matching (TCM) within the chain-of-inference, enabling multi-task fusion and iterative refinement of object features using estimated auditory parameters. We evaluate DeepASA on representative spatial audio benchmark datasets, including ASA2, MC-FUSS, and STARSS23. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both source separation and auditory parameter estimation under diverse spatial auditory scenes.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Single-Channel Audio Separation with Diffusion Source Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07226</link>

Abstract: Single-channel audio separation aims to separate individual sources from a single-channel mixture. Most existing methods rely on supervised learning with synthetically generated paired data. However, obtaining high-quality paired data in real-world scenarios is often difficult. This data scarcity can degrade model performance under unseen conditions and limit generalization ability. To this end, in this work, we approach this problem from an unsupervised perspective, framing it as a probabilistic inverse problem. Our method requires only diffusion priors trained on individual sources. Separation is then achieved by iteratively guiding an initial state toward the solution through reconstruction guidance. Importantly, we introduce an advanced inverse problem solver specifically designed for separation, which mitigates gradient conflicts caused by interference between the diffusion prior and reconstruction guidance during inverse denoising. This design ensures high-quality and balanced separation performance across individual sources. Additionally, we find that initializing the denoising process with an augmented mixture instead of pure Gaussian noise provides an informative starting point that significantly improves the final performance. To further enhance audio prior modeling, we design a novel time-frequency attention-based network architecture that demonstrates strong audio modeling capability. Collectively, these improvements lead to significant performance gains, as validated across speech-sound event, sound event, and speech separation tasks.</description>

      <title>Fewer Hallucinations, More Verification: A Three-Stage LLM-Based Framework for ASR Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3) reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.</description>
