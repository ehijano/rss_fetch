      <title>Integrating Protein Sequence and Expression Level to Analysis Molecular Characterization of Breast Cancer Subtypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breast cancer's complexity and variability pose significant challenges in understanding its progression and guiding effective treatment. This study aims to integrate protein sequence data with expression levels to improve the molecular characterization of breast cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcomes. Using ProtGPT2, a language model designed for protein sequences, we generated embeddings that capture the functional and structural properties of proteins sequence. These embeddings were integrated with protein expression level to form enriched biological representations, which were analyzed using machine learning methods like ensemble K-means for clustering and XGBoost for classification. Our approach enabled successful clustering of patients into biologically distinct groups and accurately predicted clinical outcomes such as survival and biomarkers status, achieving high performance metrics, notably an F1 score of 0.88 for survival and 0.87 for biomarkers status prediction. Feature importance analysis identified KMT2C, CLASP2, and MYO1B as key proteins involved in hormone signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and therapy resistance in hormone receptor-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, with potential influence on breast cancer subtype behavior and progression. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction networks and correlation analyses revealed functional interdependencies among proteins that may influence breast cancer subtype behavior and progression. These findings suggest that integrating protein sequence and expression data provides valuable insights into tumor biology and has significant potential to enhance personalized treatment strategies in breast cancer care.</description>

      <title>CryoSAMU: Enhancing 3D Cryo-EM Density Maps of Protein Structures at Intermediate Resolution with Structure-Aware Multimodal U-Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 3D density maps at intermediate resolution (4-8 {\AA}) is crucial in protein structure determination. Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of automated approaches for enhancing experimental cryo-EM density maps. Yet, these methods are not optimized for intermediate-resolution maps and rely on map density features alone. To address this, we propose CryoSAMU, a novel method designed to enhance 3D cryo-EM density maps of protein structures using structure-aware multimodal U-Nets and trained on curated intermediate-resolution density maps. We comprehensively evaluate CryoSAMU across various metrics and demonstrate its competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, CryoSAMU achieves significantly faster processing speed, showing promise for future practical applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/chenwei-zhang/CryoSAMU.</description>
