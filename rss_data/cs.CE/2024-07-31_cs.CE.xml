      <title>Online Prediction-Assisted Safe Reinforcement Learning for Electric Vehicle Charging Station Recommendation in Dynamically Coupled Transportation-Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), the transportation network and power grid become increasingly interdependent and coupled via charging stations. The concomitant growth in charging demand has posed challenges for both networks, highlighting the importance of charging coordination. Existing literature largely overlooks the interactions between power grid security and traffic efficiency. In view of this, we study the en-route charging station (CS) recommendation problem for EVs in dynamically coupled transportation-power systems. The system-level objective is to maximize the overall traffic efficiency while ensuring the safety of the power grid. This problem is for the first time formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and an online prediction-assisted safe reinforcement learning (OP-SRL) method is proposed to learn the optimal and secure policy by extending the PPO method. To be specific, we mainly address two challenges. First, the constrained optimization problem is converted into an equivalent unconstrained optimization problem by applying the Lagrangian method. Second, to account for the uncertain long-time delay between performing CS recommendation and commencing charging, we put forward an online sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) predictor for state augmentation to guide the agent in making forward-thinking decisions. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experimental studies based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network and a large-scale real-world road network, coupled with IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus distribution systems, respectively. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baselines in terms of road network efficiency, power grid safety, and EV user satisfaction. The case study on the real-world network also illustrates the applicability in the practical context.</description>

      <title>COEFF-KANs: A Paradigm to Address the Electrolyte Field with KANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce the experimental validation workload for chemical researchers and accelerate the design and optimization of high-energy-density lithium metal batteries, we aim to leverage models to automatically predict Coulombic Efficiency (CE) based on the composition of liquid electrolytes. There are mainly two representative paradigms in existing methods: machine learning and deep learning. However, the former requires intelligent input feature selection and reliable computational methods, leading to error propagation from feature estimation to model prediction, while the latter (e.g. MultiModal-MoLFormer) faces challenges of poor predictive performance and overfitting due to limited diversity in augmented data. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method COEFF (COlumbic EFficiency prediction via Fine-tuned models), which consists of two stages: pre-training a chemical general model and fine-tuning on downstream domain data. Firstly, we adopt the publicly available MoLFormer model to obtain feature vectors for each solvent and salt in the electrolyte. Then, we perform a weighted average of embeddings for each token across all molecules, with weights determined by the respective electrolyte component ratios. Finally, we input the obtained electrolyte features into a Multi-layer Perceptron or Kolmogorov-Arnold Network to predict CE. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA for predicting CE compared to all baselines. Data and code used in this work will be made publicly available after the paper is published.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Hybrid In-Situ Techniques in Computational Fluid Dynamics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems provide input/output (IO) performance growing relatively slowly compared to peak computational performance and have limited storage capacity. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications aiming to leverage the full power of Exascale HPC systems, such as the solver Nek5000, will generate massive data for further processing. These data need to be efficiently stored via the IO subsystem. However, limited IO performance and storage capacity may result in performance, and thus scientific discovery, bottlenecks. In comparison to traditional post-processing methods, in-situ techniques can reduce or avoid writing and reading the data through the IO subsystem, promising to be a solution to these problems. In this paper, we study the performance and resource usage of three in-situ use cases: data compression, image generation, and uncertainty quantification. We furthermore analyze three approaches when these in-situ tasks and the simulation are executed synchronously, asynchronously, or in a hybrid manner. In-situ compression can be used to reduce the IO time and storage requirements while maintaining data accuracy. Furthermore, in-situ visualization and analysis can save Terabytes of data from being routed through the IO subsystem to storage. However, the overall efficiency is crucially dependent on the characteristics of both, the in-situ task and the simulation. In some cases, the overhead introduced by the in-situ tasks can be substantial. Therefore, it is essential to choose the proper in-situ approach, synchronous, asynchronous, or hybrid, to minimize overhead and maximize the benefits of concurrent execution.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Techniques on GPU-Accelerated Data-Intensive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational power of High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems is constantly increasing, however, their input/output (IO) performance grows relatively slowly, and their storage capacity is also limited. This unbalance presents significant challenges for applications such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which generate massive amounts of data for further visualization or analysis. At the same time, checkpointing is crucial for long runs on HPC clusters, due to limited walltimes and/or failures of system components, and typically requires the storage of large amount of data. Thus, restricted IO performance and storage capacity can lead to bottlenecks for the performance of full application workflows (as compared to computational kernels without IO). In-situ techniques, where data is further processed while still in memory rather to write it out over the I/O subsystem, can help to tackle these problems. In contrast to traditional post-processing methods, in-situ techniques can reduce or avoid the need to write or read data via the IO subsystem. They offer a promising approach for applications aiming to leverage the full power of large scale HPC systems. In-situ techniques can also be applied to hybrid computational nodes on HPC systems consisting of graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). On one node, the GPUs would have significant performance advantages over the CPUs. Therefore, current approaches for GPU-accelerated applications often focus on maximizing GPU usage, leaving CPUs underutilized. In-situ tasks using CPUs to perform data analysis or preprocess data concurrently to the running simulation, offer a possibility to improve this underutilization.</description>

      <title>AhmedML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset for Incompressible, Low-Speed Bluff Body Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is currently limited by the lack of openly available training data. This paper presents a new open-source dataset comprising of high fidelity, scale-resolving CFD simulations of 500 geometric variations of the Ahmed Car Body - a simplified car-like shape that exhibits many of the flow topologies that are present on bluff bodies such as road vehicles. The dataset contains simulation results that exhibit a broad set of fundamental flow physics such as geometry and pressure-induced flow separation as well as 3D vortical structures. Each variation of the Ahmed car body were run using a high-fidelity, time-accurate, hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) - Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence modelling approach using the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM. The dataset contains boundary, volume, geometry, and time-averaged forces/moments in widely used open-source formats. In addition, the OpenFOAM case setup is provided so that others can reproduce or extend the dataset. This represents to the authors knowledge, the first open-source large-scale dataset using high-fidelity CFD methods for the widely used Ahmed car body that is available to freely download with a permissive license (CC-BY-SA).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Windkessel calibration using optimized 0D surrogate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundary condition (BC) calibration to assimilate clinical measurements is an essential step in any subject-specific simulation of cardiovascular fluid dynamics. Bayesian calibration approaches have successfully quantified the uncertainties inherent in identified parameters. Yet, routinely estimating the posterior distribution for all BC parameters in 3D simulations has been unattainable due to the infeasible computational demand. We propose an efficient method to identify Windkessel parameter posteriors using results from a single high-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) model evaluation. We only evaluate the 3D model once for an initial choice of BCs and use the result to create a highly accurate zero-dimensional (0D) surrogate. We then perform Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) using the optimized 0D model to derive the high-dimensional Windkessel BC posterior distribution. We validate this approach in a publicly available dataset of N=72 subject-specific vascular models. We found that optimizing 0D models to match 3D data a priori lowered their median approximation error by nearly one order of magnitude. In a subset of models, we confirm that the optimized 0D models still generalize to a wide range of BCs. Finally, we present the high-dimensional Windkessel parameter posterior for different measured signal-to-noise ratios in a vascular model using SMC. We further validate that the 0D-derived posterior is a good approximation of the 3D posterior. The minimal computational demand of our method using a single 3D simulation, combined with the open-source nature of all software and data used in this work, will increase access and efficiency of Bayesian Windkessel calibration in cardiovascular fluid dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>WindsorML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset For Automotive Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new open-source high-fidelity dataset for Machine Learning (ML) containing 355 geometric variants of the Windsor body, to help the development and testing of ML surrogate models for external automotive aerodynamics. Each Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was run with a GPU-native high-fidelity Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulations (WMLES) using a Cartesian immersed-boundary method using more than 280M cells to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. The dataset contains geometry variants that exhibits a wide range of flow characteristics that are representative of those observed on road-cars. The dataset itself contains the 3D time-averaged volume &amp; boundary data as well as the geometry and force &amp; moment coefficients. This paper discusses the validation of the underlying CFD methods as well as contents and structure of the dataset. To the authors knowledge, this represents the first, large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset for the Windsor body with a permissive open-source license (CC-BY-SA).</description>
