      <title>Phase Diagrams Construction Using Mean-Field Renormalization and Neural Network Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the mean-field renormalization group (MFRG) method, we analyzed the $Fe_p Mn_{0.6-p}Al_{0.4}$ and $Fe_{p}Al_{1-p}$ alloys, incorporating second-neighbor interactions in the latter for the first time within this framework. Our analysis utilized neural network fitting, yielding promising results in both the phase diagram adjustments and the estimation of bond energies.</description>

      <title>3D Multiphase Heterogeneous Microstructure Generation Using Conditional Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to generate 3D multiphase microstructures on-demand with targeted attributes can greatly accelerate the design of advanced materials. Here, we present a conditional latent diffusion model (LDM) framework that rapidly synthesizes high-fidelity 3D multiphase microstructures tailored to user specifications. Using this approach, we generate diverse two-phase and three-phase microstructures at high resolution (volumes of $128 \times 128 \times 64$ voxels, representing $&gt;10^6$ voxels each) within seconds, overcoming the scalability and time limitations of traditional simulation-based methods. Key design features, such as desired volume fractions and tortuosities, are incorporated as controllable inputs to guide the generative process, ensuring that the output structures meet prescribed statistical and topological targets. Moreover, the framework predicts corresponding manufacturing (processing) parameters for each generated microstructure, helping to bridge the gap between digital microstructure design and experimental fabrication. While demonstrated on organic photovoltaic (OPV) active-layer morphologies, the flexible architecture of our approach makes it readily adaptable to other material systems and microstructure datasets. By combining computational efficiency, adaptability, and experimental relevance, this framework addresses major limitations of existing methods and offers a powerful tool for accelerated materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Coherent control through phonon anharmonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anharmonic lattice vibrations play a key role in many physical phenomena. They govern the heat conductivity of solids, strongly affect the phonon spectra, play a prominent role in soft mode phase transitions, allow ultrafast engineering of material properties and more. The most direct evidence for anharmonicity is to measure the oscillation frequency changing as a function of the oscillation amplitude. For lattice vibrations, this is not a trivial task, and anharmonicity is probed indirectly through its effects on thermodynamic properties and spectral features or through coherent decay of one mode to another. However, measurement of the anharmonicity of a single Raman mode is still lacking. We show that ultrafast double pump-probe spectroscopy could be used to directly observe frequency shifts of Raman phonons as a function of the oscillation amplitude and disentangle the coherent contributions from quasi-harmonic sources such as temperature and changes to the carrier density in the thermoelectric materials SnTe and SnSe. Our results have dramatic implications for the material engineering of future thermoelectrics. Moreover, our methodology could be used to isolate the basic mechanisms driving optically induced phase transitions and other nonlinear phenomena based on their unique timestamps.</description>

      <title>Core Energies in Isolated Edge and Mixed Dislocations in BCC Fe from First-principles Energy Density Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use first-principles spin-polarized energy density method (EDM) to calculate the atomic energies in isolated $a_0[100](010)$ edge, $a_0[100](011)$ edge, $\frac{a_0}{2}[\bar1\bar11](1\bar10)$ edge and $\frac{a_0}{2}[111](1\bar10)$ $71^\circ$ mixed dislocations in body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe. The distribution of atomic energies shows the energetic effects of slip, including non-linear displacements in and near the core, and the elastic field further away. The EDM atomic energies agree well with anisotropic elasticity predictions in the elastic region, while they deviate in the core region due to failure of linear elasticity, and the energy deviation quantifies the core widths. Dislocation line energies are obtained by partial sums of the atomic energies within distance $r$ of the dislocation center; the core energy is extracted from the large $r$ behavior. We compare our results with an EAM and a GAP potential, showing that while both potentials produce core structures similar to DFT predictions, the GAP potential has a closer match with DFT and EDM in core energies.</description>

      <title>Atomic Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a N\'eel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear N\'eel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42{\deg} and 26{\deg} respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered N\'eel order of local dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Memristive properties and synaptic plasticity in substituted pyridinium iodobismuthates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of organic cations in bismuth iodide complexes on their memristive behavior in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) type thin-layer devices. The presence of electron-donating and electron withdrawing functional groups (-CN, -CH3, -NH2, and -N(CH3)2) on pyridinium cations induces morphological alterations in crystals, thus influencing the electronic or ionic conductivity of devices comprising sandwiched thin layers (thickness = 200 nm +/-50) between glass/ITO as bottom electrode (~ 110 nm) and copper (~ 80 nm) as the top electrode. It was found that the current-voltage (I-V) scans of the devices reveal characteristic pinched hysteresis loops, a distinct signature of memristors. The working voltage windows are significantly influenced by both the types of cation and the dimensionality of ionic fragments (0D or 1D) in the solid-state form. Additionally, the temperature alters the surface area of the I-V loops by affecting resistive switching mechanisms, corresponding log-log plots at three temperatures (-30 {\deg}C, room temperature and 150 {\deg}C) are fully studied. Given that a memristor can operate as a single synapse without the need for programming, aligning with the requirements of neuromorphic computing, the study investigates long-term depression, potentiation, and spike-time-dependent plasticity-a specific form of the Hebbian learning rule-to mimic biologically synaptic plasticity. Different polar pulses, such as triangle, sawtooth, and square waveforms were employed to generate Hebbian learning rules. The research demonstrates how the shape of the applied pulse series, achieved by overlapping pre- and post-pulses at different time scales, in association with the composition and dimensionality of ionic fragments, lead to changes in the synaptic weight percentages of the devices.</description>

      <title>Lessons from the trenches on evaluating machine-learning systems in materials science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements are fundamental to knowledge creation in science, enabling consistent sharing of findings and serving as the foundation for scientific discovery. As machine learning systems increasingly transform scientific fields, the question of how to effectively evaluate these systems becomes crucial for ensuring reliable progress.
  In this review, we examine the current state and future directions of evaluation frameworks for machine learning in science. We organize the review around a broadly applicable framework for evaluating machine learning systems through the lens of statistical measurement theory, using materials science as our primary context for examples and case studies. We identify key challenges common across machine learning evaluation such as construct validity, data quality issues, metric design limitations, and benchmark maintenance problems that can lead to phantom progress when evaluation frameworks fail to capture real-world performance needs.
  By examining both traditional benchmarks and emerging evaluation approaches, we demonstrate how evaluation choices fundamentally shape not only our measurements but also research priorities and scientific progress. These findings reveal the critical need for transparency in evaluation design and reporting, leading us to propose evaluation cards as a structured approach to documenting measurement choices and limitations.
  Our work highlights the importance of developing a more diverse toolbox of evaluation techniques for machine learning in materials science, while offering insights that can inform evaluation practices in other scientific domains where similar challenges exist.</description>

      <title>Exploration of metastable A-site-ordered perovskites (Ca,Ba)FeO3-{\delta} by computationally-guided multi-step synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite-type iron oxides with Fe4+ ions have attracted much attention for their versatile helimagnetic phases. While the introduction of a layered A-site ordered structure to AFeO3 with Fe4+ ions potentially lead to novel helimagnetic phases, the synthetic pathway spanning high pressure range is apparently difficult to elucidate. Here, we explored new A-site ordered perovskite-type iron oxides (Ca,Ba)FeO3-{\delta} with Fe4+ ions with the support of first-principles calculations evaluating thermodynamic stability at selected pressures and chemical compositions. Among the six types of putative A-site ordered perovskites with and without oxygen vacancy, only two types of oxygen-deficient perovskites CaBaFe2O6-{\delta} and Ca(Ba0.9Ca0.1)2Fe3O9-{\delta} ({\delta}~1) were successfully obtained by high-pressure synthesis, being consistent with the DFT-based convex-hull calculations. Considering the evaluated stability of the putative perovskites at selected pressures, we adopted low-temperature topotactic oxidation using ozone at ambient pressure and obtained the oxidized perovskites CaBaFe2O6-{\delta} ({\delta}~0.4) and Ca(Ba0.9Ca0.1)2Fe3O9-{\delta} ({\delta}~0.6), potentially showing novel helimagnetic phases. This study demonstrates that computational visualization of multi-step synthetic pathways involving high pressure can accelerate the search for new metastable perovskites with rich magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>The reliability of hybrid functionals for accurate fundamental and optical gap prediction of bulk solids and surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid functionals have been considered insufficiently reliable for the prediction of band gaps in solids and surfaces. We revisit this issue with a new generation of optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functionals, focusing on the reconstructed Si(111)-(2x1) and Ge(111)-(2x1) surfaces. We show that certain hybrid functionals can accurately predict the surface-state and bulk fundamental and optical gaps, as well as projected band structures of these surfaces, by combining ground-state and time-dependent density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Spin Texture Control and Magnetic Gap Engineering in a Ferromagnetic Insulator-Topological Insulator Sandwiched Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials combining magnetism and topological fermions are a key platform for low-energy electronics, spintronics, and quantum phases that break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Coupling a topological insulator to a magnetic material allows proximity magnetization with the potential to achieve these phases at elevated temperatures. One potential architecture for realizing QAHE at elevated temperature is a heterostructure comprising two single-septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with four-quintuple layer (4QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle. However, the origin of this gap has not yet been explicitly determined, as there are other non-magnetic mechanisms that have been shown to produce bandgaps in similar systems. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, the magnetic nature of the gap opening is investigated to demonstrates direct control of the spin state via small magnetic fields and confirm the magnetic origin of the gap through spin splitting and broken TRS. Furthermore, the hallmark chiral spin texture of non-magnetic topological insulators is preserved away from the {\Gamma}-point, despite the large 72+/-10 meV exchange gap at the Dirac point. The robust magnetic gap and controllable spin texture hold significant promise for future technologies requiring both magnetic properties and topological protection.</description>

      <title>A pseudo-dynamic phase-field model for brittle fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enforcement of global energy conservation in phase-field fracture simulations has been an open problem for the last 25 years. Specifically, the occurrence of unstable fracture is accompanied by a loss in total potential energy, which suggests a violation of the energy conservation law. This phenomenon can occur even with purely quasi-static, displacement-driven loading conditions, where finite crack growth arises from an infinitesimal increase in load. While such behavior is typically seen in crack nucleation, it may also occur in other situations. Initial efforts to enforce energy conservation involved backtracking schemes based on global minimization, however in recent years it has become clearer that unstable fracture, being an inherently dynamic phenomenon, cannot be adequately resolved within a purely quasi-static framework. Despite this, it remains uncertain whether transitioning to a fully dynamic framework would sufficiently address the issue. In this work, we propose a pseudo-dynamic framework designed to enforce energy balance without relying on global minimization. This approach incorporates dynamic effects heuristically into an otherwise quasi-static model, allowing us to bypass solving the full dynamic linear momentum equation. It offers the flexibility to simulate crack evolution along a spectrum, ranging from full energy conservation at one extreme to maximal energy loss at the other. Using data from recent experiments, we demonstrate that our framework can closely replicate experimental load-displacement curves, achieving results that are unattainable with classical phase-field models.</description>

      <title>ARES-Phonon: Phonon Calculation Package using Nondiagonal Supercell Finite Displacement Method with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a phonon calculation software based on the supercell finite displacement method: ARES-Phonon. It can perform phonon and related property calculations using either non-diagonal or diagonal supercell approaches. Particularly for the non-diagonal supercell method, for phonons with wave vectors $(\frac{n_1}{m_1},\frac{n_2}{m_2},\frac{n_3}{m_3})$, only a non-diagonal supercell of size equal to the least common multiple of $m_1 m_2 m_3$ needs to be constructed, significantly reducing the computational burden. We have tested this method on Diamond, $MoS_2$, and $Si_3O_6$ systems, and the results indicate that this approach can achieve the same level of accuracy as density functional perturbation theory. Speed tests were conducted for systems of different sizes, varying symmetries, and sampling densities of Brillouin zone \textbf{\textit{q}} points, showing that compared to the diagonal supercell method, the non-diagonal approach is approximately an order of magnitude faster and becomes even more efficient with increasing system complexity. Combining this method with machine learning potentials based on synchronous learning techniques, a further reduction of approximately $90\%$ in computational cost can be achieved while maintaining reliable accuracy.</description>

      <title>A-site Cation disorder engineering in Ruddlesden-Popper Layered Perovskite Oxide La2(Ba,Sr)In2O7 for Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strategic design of ferroelectric materials exhibiting robust and reversible spontaneous polarization remains a pivotal challenge in functional materials research. Here, A-site cation disorder engineering is employed in the n = 2 Ruddlesden-Popper layered perovskite La2Ba1-xSrxIn2O7 to achieve room-temperature ferroelectricity. Systematic substitution of Sr2+ for Ba2+ drives symmetry transitions from a parent centrosymmetric (CS) P42/mnm structure (x = 0) to two emergent phases: a CS Amam phase (for x from 0.3 to 0.4) and a polar A21am phase (for x from 0.5 to 0.9). Multimodal characterization combining synchrotron diffraction, neutron scattering, nonlinear optical spectroscopy, and hysteresis loop of electric polarization versus electric field reveals a hybrid improper ferroelectric (HIF) mechanism in the A21am phase, arising from trilinear coupling between octahedral rotations and tilts. Cation disorder at A-sites suppresses the interfacial rumpling-induced octahedral elongation (deformation) while enhancing the octahedral rotations which are critical for the polar symmetry stabilization. First-principles calculations further elucidate that Sr/La disorder mitigates electrostatic interactions, enabling oxygen octahedral distortions necessary for ferroelectricity. This work establishes cation disorder engineering as a versatile strategy to design high-temperature multiferroics in layered perovskites, advancing the coupling between structural distortions and functional responses in complex oxides.</description>

      <title>DiracBilinears.jl: A package for computing Dirac bilinears in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DiracBilinears.jl is a Julia package for computing Dirac bilinears, which are fundamental physical quantities of electrons in relativistic quantum theory, using first-principles calculations for solids. In relativistic quantum theory, 16 independent bilinears can be defined using the four-component Dirac field. We take the non-relativistic limit for the bilinears, which corresponds to the $1/m$ expansion, and focus on the low-energy physics typically considered in condensed matter physics. This package can evaluate the spatial distributions and Wannier matrix elements of the Dirac bilinears in solids quantitatively by connecting to the external first-principles calculation packages, including Quantum ESPRESSO, Wannier90, and wan2respack.</description>

      <title>Stark difference in the in-plane anomalous Hall response in Zintl compounds EuA2Sb2 (A = Zn, Cd) thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observation of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect in magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd2Sb2 has drawn attention to out-of-plane orbital magnetization induced by an in-plane field component. Here we study EuZn2Sb2, a sister compound of EuCd2Sb2, to demonstrate sensitive changes of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect on the band modulation. The Hall resistivity measured with rotating the magnetic field within the (001) principal plane of EuZn2Sb2 films exhibits a clear three-fold component corresponding to the in-plane anomalous Hall effect, which is distinct from the two-fold component of the planar Hall effect. The in-plane anomalous Hall effect of EuZn2Sb2 is highly contrasting to EuCd2Sb2, especially in terms of its opposite sign and field dependence, which can be explained by model calculations with different band inversion parameters. Our results pave the way for systematically controlling the in-plane anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization through elaborate band engineering.</description>

      <title>The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline. This study investigates the humidity-induced failure mechanisms in crystalline silicon solar cells. Using density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method, we systematically examine the microscopic diffusion mechanisms of hydrogen and oxygen defects and their impact on photovoltaic performance. Hydrogen and oxygen are interstitial defects that can introduce both deep-level and resonant-state recombination centers, thereby reducing carrier lifetime and solar cell efficiency. Furthermore, hydrogen exhibits prominent diffusion pathways, particularly in its +1 and 0 charge states at the BC site ( "H" _"i(BC)" ^"+1" and "H" _"i(BC)" ^"0" ), while oxygen in its +1 and 0 charge states shows a higher diffusion barrier at the BC1 site ( "O" _"i(BC1)" ^"+1" and "O" _"i(BC1)" ^"0" ). These defects, induced by moisture and temperature fluctuations, exacerbate the degradation of solar cell performance. By analyzing these defect behaviors, this research provides valuable insights into the failure mechanisms of Si solar cells, especially under humid conditions.</description>

      <title>Magnon thermal conductivity in multiferroics with spin cycloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, characterized by the occurrence of two or more ferroic properties, hold potential in future technological applications and also exhibit intriguing phenomena caused by the interplay of multiple orders. One such example is the formation of spin cycloid structures within multiferroic materials, which we investigate in this work by focusing on their magnon excitations and transport based on a general multiferroic Hamiltonian with an antiferromagnetic order. More specifically, we identify the ground state and explore the dynamics of magnon modes, revealing distinct in-plane and out-of-plane modes with anisotropic dispersion relations.The magnon modes include a massless excitation, known as the Goldstone boson, originating from the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry by the formation of the cycloid structures. By employing the Boltzmann transport formalism, the magnonic thermal conductivity with spin cycloids and low-temperature anisotropic behaviors is discussed. This work provides pathways to envision the spin-textured multiferroics, which may serve as a fertile ground to look for novel thermal and spin transport with the rich interplay of quasiparticles such as magnons and phonons.</description>

      <title>Double-helicoid surface states in Dirac semimetals protected by glide-time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, some $Z_2$ monopole charges were defined for Dirac semimetals with $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetry ($\mathcal{G}$: glide, $\mathcal{T}$: time-reversal) in previous works, and the charges are believed to lead to double-helicoid surface states. However, no proof of the bulk-surface correspondence is given there. In this paper, we point out one of the $Z_2$ charges in the previous works is gauge-dependent, and newly define another $Z_2$ charge. Using this new $Z_2$ charge, we give a proof of the bulk-surface correspondence. We also compare the new $Z_2$ charge with the $Z_2$ invariant for $\mathcal{G}$-protected topological crystalline insulators, and the second Stiefel-Whitney number for $\mathcal{PT}$-protected nodal line semimetals.</description>

      <title>Electrical Spin-Flip Current Switching in Layered Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors for Ultralow-Power Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient magnetic switching is a cornerstone for advancing spintronics, particularly for energy-efficient data storage and memory devices. Here, we report the electrical switching of spin-flips in V-doped WSe2 multilayers, a van der Waals (vdW)-layered diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), demonstrating ultralow-power switching operation at room temperature. Our study reveals unique linear magnetoresistance and parabolic magnetoresistance states, where electrical modulation induces transitions between interlayered ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic configurations. We identify an unconventional linear magnetoresistance hysteresis characterized by electrically driven spin flip/flop switching, distinct from conventional random network disorder or linear band-dispersion mechanisms. Applying an electrical voltage across vertical vdW layered V-doped WSe2 multilayers generates the spin currents at room temperature, driving spin-flip transitions from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic states due to a strong spin transfer torque effect. Notably, the critical current density reaches an ultralow value of 10-1Acm-2, accompanied by pico-watt power consumption, a record-low spin current density by a six-order-of-magnitude improvement over conventional spintronic devices. These findings establish the V-doped WSe2 multilayer device as a transformative platform for ultralow power spintronics, underscoring the potential of vdW-layered DMS systems for next generation energy-efficient spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Pressure Induced Altermagnetism in Layered Ternary Iron-Selenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing first-principles based calculations, we reexamined the high-pressure phases of the vacancy-ordered iron-selenides, i.e. \a245\ phase. A magnetic transition from the block-spin antiferromagnetic phase to \neelfm\ phase is observed under high pressure when the iron-vacancy order is preserved. The transition is first-order, driven by the collapse of $c$-axis and accompanied by an insulator-metal transition. In addition, the \neelfm\ phase is a rare example of {\it intrinsic} altermagnetism that does not require ligand atoms nor supercell construction to break the spatial inversion or translational symmetry between the two spin sublattices, with a spin-splitting of the band structure as large as 300 meV. The existence of this phase may resulting in nontrivial effect on the re-emerging superconducting phase of \kfsxy\ under high pressure.</description>

      <title>On the origin of bulk-related anisotropies in surface optical spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) is a powerful method for probing the optical properties of surfaces, used routinely in research and industrial applications, yet the origin of 'bulk-related' features that appear in the spectra of various surfaces has been debated for nearly 40 years. It is often argued that these features are related to surface-induced bulk anisotropy (SIBA) because they coincide with critical energies of the bulk dielectric function. In general, any quantitative RAS theory must include excitonic effects as they significantly influence the spectra and are believed to be the key to determining the origin of SIBA features. Here, we introduce a layer-resolved exciton localization (LREL) measure within the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which enables a quantitative analysis of the origins of 'bulk-related' RAS features. Applying LREL to arsenic-modified silicon reconstructions reveals that, depending on the surface reconstruction, the 'apparent' SIBA features arise primarily from states localized at the surface, with only a small contribution from the underlying layers. Our findings, further supported by the fact that the calculated spectra agree well with low-temperature RAS measurements, challenge the conventional explanation of 'bulk-related' RAS features. They indicate that in many instances bulk-enhanced surface anisotropies (BESA)-the opposite of SIBA-contribute to, or are even responsible for, 'bulk-related' RAS features. Therefore, we suggest that previously studied semiconductor surfaces, which exhibit 'bulk-related' features in their spectra, should be reanalyzed using the presented method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have computed the vibrational pattern and the electron-phonon coupling at several q-points in the Brillouin Zone for the three known pentacene polymorphs. After having verified that they effectively correspond to three different structures, we revisit the assignment of the experimental Raman modes. Finally, using a pool of post-processing tools, we present the phonon spectra and dispersions, confirming previous indications about the effect of phonon dispersion and charge mobility. In addition, we consider in an effective way the coexistence of more polymorphs and the possible role of defects and energy disorder.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of disordered residual oxygen and its impact on electronic structure in an infinite-layer nickelate superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite layer nickelates have garnered significant attention due to their potential for high-temperature superconductivity. Despite extensive research, the interplay between oxygen stoichiometry and electronic properties in infinite layer nickelates remains inadequately understood. In this study, we employ advanced electron microscopy techniques and theoretical modeling to directly visualize the distribution of residual oxygen within an 8NdNiO$_2$/2SrTiO$_3$ superlattice, providing novel insights into its structural and electronic effects. Our multislice ptychography analysis reveals a disordered arrangement of apical oxygen atoms, even in regions with low residual oxygen occupancy, invisible in conventional projected images but discernible in depth-resolved phase contrast images. This disordered distribution suggests the formation of local domains with varying degrees of oxygenation, leading to significant structural distortions. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals inhomogeneous hole doping, which may influence the occurrence of superconductivity. Complementary density functional theory calculations show how residual oxygen and associated structural distortions, such as pyramidal and octahedral configurations, alter the electronic structure. Although superconductivity was not observed in the studied superlattice, our findings highlight the critical influence of residual oxygen in shaping electronic phases and suggest that precise control of oxygen stoichiometry is essential in infinite layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Carbon magneto-ionics: Control of magnetism through voltage-driven carbon transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of magnetism through voltage-driven ionic processes (i.e., magneto-ionics) holds potential for next-generation memories and computing. This stems from its non-volatility, flexibility in adjusting the magnitude and speed of magnetic modulation, and energy efficiency. Since magneto-ionics depends on factors like ionic radius and electronegativity, identifying alternative mobile ions is crucial to embrace new phenomena and applications. Here, the feasibility of C as a prospective magneto-ionic ion is investigated in a Fe-C system by electrolyte gating. In contrast to most magneto-ionic systems, Fe-C presents a dual-ion mechanism: Fe and C act as cation and anion, respectively, moving uniformly in opposite directions under an applied electric field. This leads to a 7-fold increase in saturation magnetization with magneto-ionic rates larger than 1 emu cm-3 s-1, and a 25-fold increase in coercivity. Since carbides exhibit minimal cytotoxicity, this introduces a biocompatible dimension to magneto-ionics, paving the way for the convergence of spintronics and biotechnology.</description>

      <title>A spinless crystal for a high-performance solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks require a host material whose band gap is larger than the 8.4 eV nuclear transition energy. As such, excitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear state has so far only been demonstrated in metal fluorides, specifically CaF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, and ThF$_4$, where the large electronegativity of the halogen leads to sufficient band gaps. However, it is expected that the nuclear magnetic moment of the fluorine gives rise to a leading order broadening mechanism that limits the clock stability. Here, we use concepts of molecular design to identify a polyatomic anion, SO$_4^{2-}$, that is both nuclear spin free and of sufficient electron affinity to result in a high band gap metal sulfate system. Using state-of-the-art calculations, we find that the band gap of Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ is approximately 9 eV, large enough for direct laser excitation of $^{229}$Th. Low concentrations of $^{229}$Th in the otherwise spinless $^{232}$Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ crystal mitigate $^{229}$Th-$^{229}$Th interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of $^{229}$Th does not modify the material band gap nor introduce electronic states associated with nuclear quenching. By removing one of the primary sources of nuclear line broadening in the crystal, the nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, a nuclear clock with instability as low as $\sigma = 4.6\times10^{-23}/\sqrt{\tau}$, where ${\tau}$ is the averaging time, may be realized. This is roughly six orders of magnitude lower than previously thought possible.</description>

      <title>Charge-transfer-mediated boron magneto-ionics: Towards voltage-driven multi-ion transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voltage control of magnetism via magneto-ionics, where ion transport and/or redox processes drive magnetic modulation, holds great promise for next-generation memories and computing. This stems from its non-volatility and ability to precisely tune both the magnitude and speed of magnetic properties in an energy-efficient manner. However, expanding magneto-ionics to incorporate novel mobile ions or even multiple ion species is crucial for unlocking new phenomena and enabling multifunctional capabilities. Here, we demonstrate voltage-driven multi-ion transport in a FeBO system with increasing oxygen content, progressively transitioning from an electrostatic-like response to a more pronounced electrochemical (magneto-ionic) behavior. The voltage-driven transport of both B and Fe is activated by oxidation state tuning, owing to the larger electronegativity of oxygen. Such charge-transfer effects allow multi-ion magneto-ionics, where O ions move oppositely to Fe and B ions. These results pave the way for programmable functionalities by leveraging elements with different electron affinities through charge-transfer engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskites exhibit remarkable efficiency in photovoltaics, driven by exceptionally long carrier diffusion lengths and recombination times. Paradoxically, this performance persists even in defect-rich, solution-grown samples. Here, we use a suite of optical and charge transport measurements to reveal that key optoelectronic properties of perovskites arise from localized flexoelectric polarization confined to the interfaces between domains of spontaneous strain, present even in nominally cubic single crystals. This insight provides a microscopic link between structural composition and charge transport in these materials, reconciling conflicting prior observations and offering new design principles for perovskite-based solar cells.</description>

      <title>Influence of tip materials on the friction force microscopy of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001): comparison of diamond and silicon tips in experiments and atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction force microscopy (FFM) with silicon tips on epitaxial graphene supported by SiC(0001) previously revealed a sharp increase in friction at a threshold normal force, linked to the intermittent rehybridization of graphene and the formation of single-layer diamond above 12 GPa. In this study, the FFM behavior of a diamond tip is compared with that of the silicon tip. The diamond tip exhibited a similar abrupt increase in friction, but the threshold normal force was approximately twice as high for comparable tip radii. Simulations of graphene on SiC(0001) sliding against hydroxylated amorphous carbon (a-C) and silicon oxide (SiO2) slabs show that both systems exhibit low shear stress at low pressures, which increases at higher pressures due to bond formation between the graphene and counter slabs. The pressure dependence differs slightly: SiO2 reaches a shear stress plateau around 6 GPa, while a-C continues to increase gradually. For a-C, the transition threshold shifts to higher pressures, consistent with FFM results. Temperature lowers the transition threshold significantly, while sliding velocity has minimal impact on shear stress. These findings provide insights into the stability of low-friction interfaces between epitaxial graphene and the key materials which come into contact with graphene in current micro-electro-mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of exciton insulator phase: Emergent $\textit{p}$-wave spin textures from spontaneous excitonic condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excitonic insulator$^{1,2}$ (EI) is a correlated many-body state of electron-hole pairs, potentially leading to high-temperature condensate and superfluidity$^{3-7}$. Despite ever-growing experiments suggesting possible EI states in various materials, direct proofs remain elusive and debated. Here we address the problem by introducing an ab initio methodology, enabling the parameter-free determination of electron-hole pairing order parameter and single-particle excitations within a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type formalism. Our calculations on monolayer 1T'-MoS$_{2}$$^{8,9}$ reveals that it is an unconventional EI with a transition temperature ~900K, breaking spontaneously the crystal's inversion, rotation, and mirror symmetries, while maintaining odd parity and unitarity. We identify several telltale spectroscopic signatures emergent in this EI phase that distinguish it from the band insulator (BI) phase, exemplified with a giant $\textbf{k}$-dependent $\textit{p}$-wave spin texture.</description>

      <title>Probing the Limit of Heat Transfer in Inorganic Crystals with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer is a fundamental property of matter. Research spanning decades has attempted to discover materials with exceptional thermal conductivity, yet the upper limit remains unknown. Using deep learning accelerated crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculation, we systematically explore the thermal conductivity landscape of inorganic crystals. We brute-force over half a million ordered crystalline structures, encompassing an extensive coverage of local energy minima in binary compounds with up to four atoms per primitive cell. We confirm diamond sets the upper bound of thermal conductivity within our search space, very likely also among all stable crystalline solids at ambient conditions. We identify over 20 novel crystals with high thermal conductivity surpassing silicon at room temperature validated by density functional theory. These include a series of metallic compounds, especially MnV, exhibiting high lattice and electronic thermal conductivity simultaneously, a distinctive feature not observed before. The fast deep learning-driven screening method, as well as the large comprehensive thermal conductivity database, pave the way for the discovery and design of next-generation materials with tailored thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Peak splitting and bias fields in ferroelectric hafnia mediated by interface charge effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pristine state of hafnium based ferroelectric devices exhibits various unwanted properties, such as imprint and peak splitting, which diminish with bipolar cycling. The incorporation of a niobium oxide layer at different positions in metal-ferroelectric-metal and metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal stacks is used to modify the pristine state of the device. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements are used to investigate the influence of niobium oxide on the zirconium hafnium oxide layer. It is hypothesized that the charged vacancies generated by the introduced niobium oxide in the adjacent zirconium hafnium oxide layer result in an electric bias field that influences the pristine polarization state of the domains. A comparison of different stacks shows that peak splitting in the pristine state is most likely related to the formation of opposing electric bias fields in upwards and downwards polarized domains. Furthermore, the incorporation of niobium oxide in the zirconium hafnium oxide/aluminum oxide capacitor stack in between the ferroelectric and insulating layer leads to a peak splitting free device without imprint, which could be explained by the increased influence of charge trapping near the zirconium hafnium oxide-/niobium oxide and niobium oxide-/aluminum oxide interfaces.</description>

      <title>Edge Exposure as the Trigger for Structural Instability in LP-N and HLP-N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LP-N and HLP-N are promising high-energy-density materials. However, these materials synthesized under high pressure cannot be maintained stable at ambient conditions. The mechanism behind their instability remains unclear. Our research, based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that while not edge exposed, LP-N and HLP-N exhibit substantial structural, dynamic, and mechanical stability under ambient conditions. The stability of HLP-N is governed by an interlocking mechanism, which becomes ineffective upon exposure of the edges, leading to internal breakdown. As a result, H saturated adsorption has no impact on it. In contrast, LP-N benefits modestly from H saturated adsorption due to its edge-initiated dissociation. The interlocking mechanism offer valuable insights into the design of new materials.</description>

      <title>Large Thermal Hall Effect in MnPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the thermal Hall effect can originate from magnons (magnon Hall effect), phonons (phonon Hall effect), or their combination (magnon-polaron Hall effect). The magnon-polaron Hall effect, first observed in Fe2Mo3O8, is particularly intriguing as its thermal Hall signal can be remarkably large. In this study, we explore the thermal Hall effect in MnPS3, an insulating antiferromagnetic material exhibiting a spin-flop transition and significant magnetoelastic coupling, making it a strong candidate for studying the thermal Hall effect originating from spin-lattice coupling. We report an exceptionally large thermal Hall angle down to 4 K and show that it cannot be accounted for by standard calculations based on the intrinsic magnon-polaron Berry curvature. Our findings provide an in-depth analysis of the role of the spin-flop transition in the thermal properties of MnPS3 and call for further theory development on magnon-phonon coupling and scattering to reveal their influence on transverse heat transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and adiabaticity in molecules and in condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adiabatic theorem states that when the time evolution of the Hamiltonian is "infinitely slow", a system, when started in the ground state, remains in the instantaneous ground state at all times. This, however, does not mean that the adiabatic evolution of a generic observable obtains simply as its expectation value over the instantaneous eigenstate. As a general principle there is an additional adiabatic term, of quantum-geometrical nature, which is the relevant one for several static or adiabatic observables. This is shown explicitly for the cases of polarizability and infrared tensors (in molecules and condensed matter); rotational g factor and magnetizability (in molecules only). Quantum geometry allows for a transparent derivation and a compact expression for these observables, alternative to the well known sum-over-states Kubo formulas.</description>

      <title>Quantized Spin-Hall Conductivity in Altermagnet Fe$_2$Te$_2$O with Mirror-Spin Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), crucial for the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, a quantized spin-Hall conductivity has not yet been reported in QSH insulators and other realistic materials. Here, we tackle this challenge by predicting robust quantized spin-Hall conductivity in monolayer Fe$_2$Te$_2$O. The underlying physics originates from the unrecognized mirror-spin coupling (MSC), which couples spin-up and spin-down states into two orthogonal mirror eigenstates. We show that the MSC can naturally emerge in the two-dimensional altermagnets with out-of-plane N\'eel vector and horizontal mirror. A remarkable consequence of the MSC is that it can dramatically weaken the spin hybridization of the altermagnetic materials when SOC is included. When SOC is neglected, Fe$_2$Te$_2$O is an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal with MSC. With SOC, it evolves into the first material candidate for magnetic mirror Chern insulator. Remarkably, under the protection of MSC, the spin hybridization of both bulk and topological edge states in Fe$_2$Te$_2$O with SOC at low energy is negligible. As a consequence, a quantized spin-Hall conductivity emerges within the bulk band gap of the system. By unveiling a novel effect, our findings represent a significant advancement in spin Hall transport, and broaden the material candidates hosting intriguing altermagnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Water is a superacid at extreme thermodynamic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical behavior of water under extreme pressures and temperatures lies at the heart of processes shaping planetary interiors, influences the deep carbon cycle, and underpins innovative high-temperature, high-pressure synthesis of materials. Recent experiments reveal that hydrocarbons immersed in ionized water under extreme conditions transform into heavy hydrocarbons and nanodiamonds. However, the chemistry of water at extreme conditions and its role in hydrocarbon condensation remains poorly understood. Here, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling techniques and machine-learning interatomic potentials, we show that increasing pressure at high temperature induces water ionization, creating a superacid-like environment that favors the protonation of hydrocarbons into transient pentacoordinated carbonium ions like CH$_5^+$. These elusive intermediates release molecular hydrogen and yield highly reactive carbocations, driving hydrocarbon chain growth toward nanodiamonds. We demonstrate how the combination of water ionization and pressure-induced methane polarization leads to superacid-driven hydrocarbon chemistry, famously known at far milder conditions. Our findings reveal, for the first time, a superacid aqueous regime and establish the existence of superacid chemistry under extreme conditions. Moreover, they provide a unifying reaction network that explains chemical transformations in environments such as planetary interiors and high pressure, high temperature experiments.</description>

      <title>Membrane Charge Effects on Solute Transport in Polyamide Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyamide membranes, such as nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, are widely used for water desalination and purification. However, the mechanisms of solute transport and solute rejection due to charge interactions remain unclear at the molecular level. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the transport of single-solute feeds through charged nanofiltration membranes with different membrane charge concentrations of COO$^{\text{-}}$ and NH$_2\!^+$ corresponding to different pH levels. Results show that Na$^+$ and Cl$^{\text{-}}$ solute ions are better rejected when the membrane has a higher concentration of negatively charged groups, corresponding to a higher pH, whereas CaCl$_2$ is well-rejected at all pH levels studied. These results are consistent with experimental findings which are performed at the same pH conditions as simulation setup. Moreover, solute transport behavior depends on the membrane functional group distribution. When COO$^{\text{-}}$ functional groups are concentrated at membrane feed surface, ion permeation into the membrane is reduced. Counter-ions tend to associate with charged functional groups while co-ions seem to pass by the charged groups more easily. In addition, steric effects play a role when ions of opposite charge cluster in pores of the membrane. This study reveals solute transport and rejection mechanisms related to membrane charge and provides insights into how membranes might be designed to achieve specific desired solute rejection.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Hubbard approach to correlated materials: the case of transition-metal monoxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic correlations beyond static mean-field theories are of fundamental importance in describing the properties of complex materials - such as transition-metal oxides - where the low-energy physics is driven by localized d or f electrons. Here, we show that it is possible to capture these correlations with a local and dynamical self energy, extending to the spin-polarized and multi-site case our recently introduced dynamical Hubbard functional formulation. We apply this formalism to the prototypical transition-metal monoxide series of MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in their ground state, finding excellent agreement with experiments for the spectral properties. The results are comparable or improved with respect to state-of-the-art theories, both for the densities of states and for the spectral functions - including band renormalization and spectral weight transfer - in a numerically efficient and physically transparent treatment of correlations amenable to the study of realistic, complex materials.</description>

      <title>Electronic reconstruction and interface engineering of emergent spin fluctuations in compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ on SrLaAlO$_4$(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c \sim 40$ K in La3Ni2O7 on SrLaAlO4(001) (SLAO), we explore the structural and electronic properties as well as the spin-spin correlation function of this bilayer nickelate system by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility via Fermi surface nesting, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</description>

      <title>Surface Reaction Simulations for Battery Materials through Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization and Local Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum chemistry calculations are essential for understanding electronic structures, yet exactly solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation remains impractical due to electron correlation effects. While Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used, its inherent approximations limit its ability to capture strong correlation effects, particularly in surface reactions. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, especially for localized electron interactions. In this work, we apply a quantum embedding approach to study the Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Lithium battery electrode surfaces. We employ an active space selection strategy, using Density Difference Analysis to identify key orbitals, which are subsequently refined with coupled-cluster natural orbitals. These are treated using Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) and its extended version (Ext-SQD), leveraging the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz for efficient state preparation on quantum hardware. Ext-SQD significantly improves upon standard SQD by incorporating excitation operators into the quantum-computed electron configurations used in classical Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy over Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) calculations over ground state energies. The results, validated against Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CASCI), whenever computationally feasible, and Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (HCI), provide new insights into $\mathrm{Li}$-$\mathrm{O_2}$ surface reactions, underscoring the potential of quantum computing in materials discovery and reaction modeling.</description>

      <title>Incident beam optics optimization for the single crystal neutron diffractometer Pioneer with a polarized beam option</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pioneer, a next-generation single-crystal neutron diffractometer, is under development for Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Second Target Station (STS). Designed to address a wide range of scientific questions, Pioneer will deliver homogeneous neutron beams with customizable size and divergence, and provide a polarized beam option. This article introduces its incident beam optics, highlighting the optimization methodology and the simulated performance. Pioneer will utilize a modified elliptical-straight guide for neutron transport and deploy slit packages and insertable apertures to control beam size and divergence. The optimized guide geometry matches the optimal-and-full-sample-illumination condition, and the beam control system effectively filters out unwanted neutrons while preserving the desired ones. Additionally, we have found that polygon-approximated guides provide satisfactory transport efficiency and beam homogeneity, eliminating the need of truly curved guides. To enhance neutronics performance and reduce cost, the coatings of supermirror elements are individually optimized to the lowest half-integer $m$-values that are sufficient to deliver the desired neutrons. After evaluating polarizing V-cavities and $^3$He spin filters over the default polarized wavelength band of 1.2-5.5~\AA, we selected a translatable multichannel polarizing V-cavity as the incident beam polarizer. Strategically placed at a location where the beam divergence is low and a large in-guide gap has negligible impact on transport efficiency, the optimized V-cavity achieves an average $P^2T$ of approximately 35\%.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the cRPA: A Comparative Analysis of Methods for Calculating Hubbard Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a systematic comparison of various approaches within the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) for calculating the Coulomb interaction parameter U. While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO2 (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO3 (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.</description>

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely applied to a variety of realistic materials but often struggles to explain the properties of correlated systems. The DFT + U method, which introduces a Hubbard U correction to the DFT, has been instrumental in providing the treatment of systems such as transition metal oxide. The methodological details of DFT + U and their specifics on the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the correlated systems remain incompletely understood. In this study, taking the prototypical transition metal oxide system, LaMnO3, as an example, we systematically assess the performance of the two distinct DFT + U methods, spin-polarized DFT (SDFT + U) and spin-un-polarized DFT (CDFT + U). We found that while Coulomb U acts similarly for the two approaches, Hund JH plays a fundamentally different role, particularly in the determination of the magnetic phases. Our investigation shows the active role of Hund JH on the exchange splitting, leading to distinct magnetic ground configurations in the two methods. We further investigate the associated magnetic exchange interactions and compare our results with so-called beyond-DFT methods.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Using $\beta$-MnO$_2$ Monolayer on Ni Electrode with Engineered Oxygen Vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing cost-effective and high-performance electrodes is critical for advancing hydrogen (H$_2$) production through electrochemical water splitting. In this study, we present a novel electrode design by depositing a $\beta$-MnO$_2$ monolayer on a conventional Ni(100) substrate (MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100)) and systematically investigate its electrocatalytic properties. This work uniquely explores the influence of oxygen vacancies (OVs) at distinct sites -- Osub-top and bridge sites -- on both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our findings reveal that the Osub-top vacancy (OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100)) significantly enhances HER activity, achieving a hydrogen Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G_{\rm H}$) of $-0.015$ eV, which surpasses the performance of noble metals such as Pt/C ($-0.082$ eV) and Ir ($-0.08$ eV). Additionally, the cathodic exchange current density $(J_{0,c})$ of OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100) reaches $10^{-0.774}$ Acm$^{-2}$, outperforming Pt/C ($10^{-0.92}$ Acm$^{-2}$) and Ir ($10^{-1.44}$ Acm$^{-2}$). Electrochemical analysis confirms a cathodic activation overpotential $(\eta_{a,c})$ of 0.141 V at 10 mAcm$^{-2}$ in a 0.5 M H$_2$SO$_4$ solution, achieving a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 0.91 mmolh$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ at an applied voltage ($V_{\rm app}$) of 1.60 V. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of site-specific oxygen vacancy effects on bifunctional MnO$_2$-based electrodes, demonstrating superior HER activity while maintaining dual functionality for both cathodic and anodic processes. Our results highlight the potential of engineered oxygen vacancies to develop low-cost, high-efficiency electrodes for sustainable hydrogen production, offering a competitive alternative to precious metal-based catalysts.</description>

      <title>Ions at electrochemical interfaces: from explicit to implicit molecular solvent descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between electronic screening inside a metal and screening by a polar molecular solvent, focusing on their impact on the charge induced by an ion and the solvent structure at the interface. To that end, we consider atomistically resolved electrodes within the Thomas-Fermi model of screening and describe the molecular solvent either explicitly via classical molecular dynamics or implicitly using Molecular Density Functional Theory (MDFT). Specifically, we examine the effect of screening by tuning the Thomas-Fermi screening length $l_\text{TF}$, the ion charge by considering Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ and the solvent nature by studying water and acetonitrile. Consistently with our previous findings without solvent, $l_\text{TF}$ significantly affects the charge distribution inside the metal. However, $l_\text{TF}$ has no significant impact on the interfacial solvent structure, suggesting that its effect on the charge distribution induced inside the metal by the ion is essentially due to how the metal responds to the (same) external charge distribution, including the solvent, even though the coupling between both sides of the interface may play a secondary role. Furthermore, MDFT accurately reproduces fine details of the interfacial solvent structure around the ion at a fraction of the computational cost of MD simulations. These results highlight the relevance of MDFT as a powerful tool to model electrochemical systems at the molecular level.</description>

      <title>Controllable Antiferromagnetic-Ferromagnetic phase transition in monolayer MnPSe3 via atomic adsorption of Li, O, and F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The engineering of magnetic order and electronic states in two-dimensional (2D) materials is pivotal for advanced spintronic technologies. Despite their potential, the scarcity of intrinsic 2D ferromagnets remains a critical challenge. Here, we employ density functional theory with Hubbard-U corrections to systematically investigate adsorbate-driven magnetic transitions in monolayer MnPSe3. While pristine MnPSe3 exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with a semiconducting gap, Li, O, and F adatom adsorption induces an AFM-to-ferromagnetic (AFM-FM) phase transition across large coverage ranges. Our calculations reveal enhanced thermodynamic stability at elevated coverages, with full-coverage configurations (Li0.5MnPSe3, MnPSe3O0.5, MnPSe3F0.5) favored energetically. Hybrid functional (HSE06) calculations show that F adsorption drives a semiconductor-to-half-metal transition, whereas Li and O adsorption preserves semiconductivity. Moreover, Li adsorption induces a valley splitting of 20.3 meV at the K1 and K2 points in the band structure of the monolayer MnPSe3. Magnetic anisotropy analysis reveals adsorbate-dependent easy-axis reorientation: Li (electron doping) switches the easy-axis from in-plane to out-of-plane, while O/F (hole doping) stabilizes in-plane easy-axis, consistent with carrier-density-modulation simulations. Crucially, carrier doping results indicate that once the electron doping concentration reaches critical concentration, the magnetic easy axis of monolayer MnPSe3 transitions from in-plane to out-of-plane. This work establishes atomic adsorption as a robust strategy for tailoring 2D magnetism, resolving discrepancies through rigorous treatment of exchange-correlation effects and configurational diversity.</description>

      <title>Revealing Superconducting Chiral Edge Modes via Resistance Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states offers a promising route to realize topological superconductivity with chiral Majorana edge modes. However, the definitive identification of these modes is challenging. Here we propose detecting superconducting chiral edge modes via the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission of QAH-superconductor heterojunctions. Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide new insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>Partial Backscattering between Helical Edge States Revealed by Energy-Selective Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The protection against backscattering of spin-momentum-locked metallic edge states makes quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) highly appealing for spintronic applications, offering exceptional resilience against non-magnetic disorder. This protection arises from the time-reversal symmetry of helical edge modes with opposite spin and momentum, which prohibits single-particle backscattering within a single Kramers pair. However, backscattering remains possible between energy-degenerate helical edge states not linked by time-reversal symmetry, as can occur in strongly non-linear edge dispersions with multiple Kramers pairs. Here, we investigate inter-Kramers pair backscattering in the non-linear edge bands of the QSHI indenene, highlighting a critical aspect of edge-state stability. Using quasiparticle interference in scanning tunneling spectroscopy -- a direct probe of backscattering -- we observe pairwise coupling of energy-degenerate helical edge states, while energy regions with only a single Kramers pair remain strictly protected. Supported by theoretical analysis, our findings extend the conventional understanding of backscattering protection beyond idealized linear dispersions to more realistic, nonlinear edge-mode configurations. This insight has profound implications for numerous QSHI candidates, emphasizing that the mere presence of gap-traversing edge modes does not inherently guarantee their topological protection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for chiral topological superconductivity in magnetic topological insulator (TI)-FeTe heterostructures is a key frontier in condensed matter physics, with potential applications in topological quantum computing. The combination of ferromagnetism, superconductivity, and topologically nontrivial surface states brings together the key elements required for chiral Majorana physics. In this work, we examine the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity at the interfaces between FeTe and a series of TI overlayers. In superconducting MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/FeTe, any interfacial suppression of antiferromagnetism must affect at most a few nanometers. On the other hand, (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$/FeTe layers exhibit near-total suppression of antiferromagnetic ordering. Ferromagnetic Cr$_x$(Bi,Sb)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$ (CBST)/FeTe bilayers exhibit net magnetization in both CBST and FeTe layers, with evidence of interactions between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. These observations identify magnetic TI/FeTe interfaces as an exceptionally robust platform to realize chiral topological superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of topological nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of topological nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to the hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of angular momentum transfer among crystal lattice modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete rotational symmetry of crystals leads to the conservation of quantized angular momentum in solids. While the exchange of energy and linear momentum between lattice vibrations (phonons) via anharmonic coupling is a cornerstone of solid-state physics, conservation and transfer of angular momentum within the lattice remains a postulate. Recently, phonon angular momentum, often in the form of chiral phonons, has been linked to giant magnetic fields, thermal Hall conductivity, dynamical multiferroicity, ultrafast demagnetization, or magnetic switching. However, the inherent process of phonon to phonon angular momentum transfer, fundamentally required to reach any magnetization equilibrium and imperative for all spin relaxation phenomena in solids, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the coherent transfer of angular momentum from one lattice mode to another by establishing helical nonlinear phononics. We directly observe rotational phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering dictated by pseudo angular momentum conservation and the threefold rotational symmetry of the topological insulator bismuth selenide. We identify nonlinear phonon-phonon coupling as an angular momentum transfer channel, confirmed by our ab-initio calculations. Besides bearing universal implications for angular momentum dissipation abundant in nature, our work actively reverses the natural flow, leading to the nonlinear upconversion of lattice angular momentum. We thus open the field of helical and chiral nonlinear phononics, representing a selective handle for ultrafast control of spins, topology and chiral quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>Theory of Intermediate Twinning and Spontaneous Polarization in Ferroelectric Potassium Sodium Niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Potassium sodium niobate is considered a prominent material system as a substitute for lead-containing ferroelectric materials. It exhibits first-order phase transformations and ferroelectricity with potential applications ranging from energy conversion to innovative cooling technologies, thereby addressing important societal challenges. However, a major obstacle in the application of potassium sodium niobate is its multi-scale heterogeneity and the lack of understanding of its phase transition pathway and microstructure. This can be seen from the findings of Pop-Ghe et al. (Ceram Int 47(14):20579-20585, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.04.067) which also reveal the occurrence of a phenomenon they term intermediate twinning during the phase transition. Here, we show that intermediate twinning is a consequence of energy minimization. We develop a geometrically nonlinear electroelastic energy function for potassium sodium niobate, including the cubic-tetragonal-orthorhombic transformations and ferroelectricity. The construction of the minimizers is based on compatibility conditions which ensure continuous deformations and pole-free interfaces. These minimizers agree with the experimental observations, including laminates between tetragonal variants under the cubic to tetragonal transformation, crossing twins under the tetragonal to orthorhombic transformation, intermediate twinning and spontaneous polarization. This shows how the full nonlinear electroelastic model provides a powerful tool in understanding, exploring, and tailoring the electromechanical properties of complex ferroelectric ceramics.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon Coupling in Many-Body Perturbation Theory: Developments within the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW approximation and LMTO Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The calculation of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling from first principles is a topic of great interest in materials science, offering a robust, non-empirical framework to understand and predict a wide range of physical phenomena. While significant progress has been made using the Kohn-Sham framework of density functional theory (KS-DFT), it is increasingly evident that standard approximations in KS-DFT often fall short of providing accurate results. These shortcomings are frequently linked to the non-local nature of the exchange-correlation potential, prompting the development of advanced methodologies within DFT and many-body perturbation theory. Despite these efforts, a highly reliable and efficient first-principles approach to accurately capture e-ph interactions remains elusive. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel field-theoretical methodology that integrates the foundational work of Baym and Hedin with the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) approximation, implemented within the Questaal electronic structure suite. Our approach, based on a response function framework, ensures that Pulay-like incomplete-basis-set corrections are not required to account for changes in basis functions, paving the way for a high-fidelity description of e-ph coupling.</description>

The volume integral of the pressure is performed by determining the volume and the bulk modulus in equilibrium at finite temperatures, where the pressure and its volume derivative are evaluated utilizing first-principles calculations of the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter without varying the volume. We validate our method for fcc Al by comparing with the conventional quasiharmonic approximation. Furthermore, we integrate our method with self-consistent phonon theory and apply it to calculations for bcc Ti, hcp Ti, and tetragonal ZrO$_2$. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method by comparing results with those obtained from directly volume-varied self-consistent phonon calculations. In all cases, our method accurately evaluates the free energy change due to thermal expansion using only constant-volume phonon calculations.</description>

      <title>Towards Verifying Exact Conditions for Implementations of Density Functional Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05316v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used extensively in the computation of electronic properties of matter, with various applications. Approximating the exchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach, the basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional approximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study, which has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact density functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical properties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are used when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for verifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions. XCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven exact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find violations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a large magnetic nonlinear Hall effect in an altermagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since Edwin Halls groundbreaking discovery of the Hall effect in 1879, magnetism, spin, and quantization have been expanding the scope of Hall effects, continuously driving transformative progress in science and technology. Among them, the latest nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), where longitudinal electric field tunes quantum geometry to generate nonlinear Hall voltage, attracts wide attention as a sensitive probe of topological phases across a wide range of materials. Here, we report a new Hall effect member: the magnetic nonlinear Hall effect (MNLHE), characterized by a quadratic Hall conductivity dependence on magnetic field, rather than electric field as in NLHE. This finding relies on an altermagnet, Mn5Si3 thin film, whose alternating-sign Berry curvatures ensure higher-order MNLHE clearly distinguishable from the first-order anomalous Hall effect. The observed quadratic dependence originates from chiral next-nearest-neighbor hopping processes that acquire magnetic-exchange-driven Zeeman energies and Haldane-like chiral flux phases. Remarkably, this MNLHE is non-analytic, as reversing the magnetic field flips the alternating spin-splitting bands and reverses the hopping chirality, which is absent in traditional NLHE. Beyond offering a distinctive transport fingerprint for altermagnet Mn5Si3 thin film, this MNLHE is large and unsaturated up to 60 T, providing opportunities for pulsed high-field sensing technologies in both fundamental researches and engineering applications.</description>

Abstract: Monolayer Chromium Dihalides and Trihalides materials can be grown on a variety of substrates by molecular beam epitaxy regardless of the lattice mismatch thanks to the van der Waals epitaxy. In this work, we studied the magnetic nature of Cr Chloride monolayers grown on Au(111), Ni(111) and graphene-passivated Ni(111) from the evaporation in ultra-high vacuum of the same halide precursor. Structural, morphological and magnetic characterizations were conducted in situ by low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Owing to opposite chemical behaviour, Au(111) and Ni(111) promote the formation of two different valence compounds, i.e. CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, showing distinct magnetic properties at 4 K. When graphene is used to passivate the Ni(111) surface, the formation of CrCl$_3$ becomes allowed also on this substrate. The coexistence of CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, both showing few nm lateral size and super-paramagnetic properties, is demonstrated by XMCD spectra displaying two dichroic peaks at the characteristic Cr$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{2+}$ energies. Site-selective magnetization measurements performed with the photon energy tuned on the two absorption edges show reversed magnetization of some of the CrCl$_2$ islands with respect to the CrCl3 domains, which is interpreted in terms of magnetic frustration.</description>

      <title>Molecular-dynamics study of diffusional creep in uranium mononitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising advanced nuclear fuel due to its high thermal conductivity and high fissile density. Yet, many aspects of its mechanical behavior and microstructural features are currently unknown. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study UN's diffusional creep. Nanometer-sized polycrystals are used to simulate diffusional creep and to calculate an effective GB width. It is found that Nabarro-Herring creep is not dominant in the temperature range of 1700$-$2000 K and that the dominant diffusional creep mechanism is Coble creep with an activation energy of 2.28 $\pm$ 0.09 eV. A method is proposed to calculate the diffusional GB width and its temperature dependence in polycrystals. The effective GB width of UN is calculated as 2.69 $\pm$ 0.08 nm. This value fits very well with the prefactor of the phenomenological Coble creep formula. It is demonstrated that the most comprehensive thermal creep model for UN can be represented as the combination of our Coble creep model and the dislocation creep model proposed by Hayes et al.</description>

      <title>Reexamining Circular Dichroism in Photoemission From a Topological Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electron states is an essential ingredient for topological and quantum geometric quantities in solids. For example, Dirac surface states with helical spin- and orbital-angular momenta are a hallmark of a 3D topological insulator. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with variable circular light polarization, known as circular dichroism (CD), has been assumed to be a direct probe of OAM and, by proxy, of the Berry curvature of electronic bands in energy- and momentum-space. Indeed, topological surface states have been shown to exhibit angle-dependent CD (CDAD), and more broadly, CD is often interpreted as evidence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, it is well-established that CD originates from the photoemission matrix elements, which can have extrinsic contributions related to the experimental geometry and the inherently broken inversion symmetry at the sample surface. Therefore, it is important to broadly examine CD-ARPES to determine the scenarios in which it provides a robust probe of intrinsic material physics. We performed CD-ARPES on the canonical topological insulator $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$ over a wide range of incident photon energies. Not only do we observe angle-dependent CD in the surface states, as expected, but we also find CD of a similar magnitude in virtually all bulk bands. Since OAM is forbidden by inversion symmetry in the bulk, we conclude this originates from symmetry-breaking in the photoemission process. Comparison with theoretical calculations supports this view and suggests that $\textit{hidden}$ OAM - localized to atomic sites within each unit cell - contributes significantly. Additional effects, including inter-atomic interference and final-state resonances, are responsible for the rapid variation of the CDAD signal with photon energy.</description>

      <title>On the Automation of High Throughput Modeling of Adsorption In Porous Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) have emerged as a promising candidate for catalysis, carbon-dioxide (CO$_{2}$) capture and storage as well as flue gas separation due to their tunable porosity and chemical stability. ZIFs consists of transition metals in a tetrahedral coordination with imidazolate linkers, allowing for structural modifications that can enhance CO$_{2}$ adsorption and storage. To systematically design and optimize ZIFs for superior CO$_{2}$ capture performance, theoretical modelling provides an effective approach, though hindered by the sheer size of the search space, with hundred to thousands of possible sites per ZIF, and thousands of possible ZIF that can be synthesized. In this work, we employ a high-throughput techniques underpinned by first-principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) to develop a systematic automated method for characterizing adsorption energetics in ZIFs, guiding the rational design and selection of desirable ZIF structures. Using high-throughput computing tools, we perform pore and pore size analysis, and implement automated CO$_{2}$ molecule placement algorithm, accounting for positional symmetry, crystallographic orientation, and collision detection. The results obtained are in good agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the reliability of the approach in accelerating the discovery of next-generation ZIFs for CO$_{2}$ capture and storage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.02879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing amount of data from ubiquitous smart devices fosters data-centric and cognitive algorithms. Traditional digital computer systems have separate logic and memory units, resulting in a huge delay and energy cost for implementing these algorithms. Memristors are programmable resistors with a memory, providing a paradigm-shifting approach towards creating intelligent hardware systems to handle data-centric tasks. Spintronic nanodevices are promising choices as they are high-speed, low-power, highly scalable, robust, and capable of constructing dynamic complex systems. In this Review, we survey spintronic devices from a memristor point of view. We introduce spintronic memristors based on magnetic tunnel junctions, nanomagnet ensemble, domain walls, topological spin textures, and spin waves, which represent dramatically different state spaces. They can exhibit steady, oscillatory, stochastic, and chaotic trajectories in their state spaces, which have been exploited for in-memory logic, neuromorphic computing, stochastic and chaos computing. Finally, we discuss challenges and trends in realizing large-scale spintronic memristive systems for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Dark Metastable Conduction Channels near a Metal-Insulator Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two main states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many mysteries at the frontier of solid state physics. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the metal-insulator transition is linked to a metastable hidden state arising within a chiral charge density wave (CDW) whose basic nature remains an open question. In this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create current-carrying filamentary channels that distinguish the 'metallic' hidden state and 'insulating' CDW states. These channels have remained dark to previous measurements, and yet are directly linked to the properties of the hidden state. We leverage the metastability of these conduction channels to demonstrate electrical control of their creation, erasure and location. Our findings show that physical elements, such as boundaries and interfaces, play a key role in the properties of the hidden state characterizing the metal-insulator transition. We suggest new possibilities for in-situ electrical design of synaptic components with possible applications to neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Stability frontiers in the AM$_6$X$_6$ kagome metals: The LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Lu,Y) family and density-wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.</description>

Abstract: Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued exploration in this rapidly developing field.</description>

      <title>Assessing zero-shot generalisation behaviour in graph-neural-network interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapidly growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for chemistry, much current research focuses on the development of generally applicable and ``foundational'' MLIPs. An important question in this context is whether, and how well, such models can transfer from one application domain to another. Here, we assess this transferability for an MLIP model at the interface of materials and molecular chemistry. Specifically, we study GO-MACE-23, a model designed for the extended covalent network of graphene oxide, and quantify its zero-shot performance for small, isolated molecules and chemical reactions outside its direct scope--in direct comparison with a state-of-the-art model which has been trained in-domain. Our work provides quantitative insight into the transfer and generalisation ability of graph-neural-network potentials and, more generally, makes a step towards the more widespread applicability of MLIPs in chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depending on multiple parameters, soft robots can exhibit different modes of locomotion that are difficult to model numerically. As a result, improving their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we optimize light-powered millimetre-scale underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results - measured swimming speed - as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. As these soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using many competing robots to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including eight-fold increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.</description>

      <title>Observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in tellurium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear thermoelectric effect is a key factor for realising unconventional thermoelectric phenomena, such as heat rectification and power generation using thermal fluctuations. Recent theoretical advances have indicated that chiral materials can host a variety of exotic nonlinear thermoelectric transport arising from inversion-symmetry breaking. However, experimental demonstration has yet to be achieved. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in chiral tellurium at room temperature, where a voltage is generated as a cross product of the temperature gradient and electric field. The resulting thermoelectric Hall voltage is on the order of {\mu}V, consistent with the prediction from the ab initio calculation. Furthermore, the sign of the thermoelectric Hall voltage is reversed depending on the crystal chirality, demonstrating a novel functionality of sign control of the thermoelectric effect by the chirality degrees of freedom. Our findings reveal the potential of chiral systems as nonlinear thermoelectric materials for advanced thermal management and energy harvesting.</description>
