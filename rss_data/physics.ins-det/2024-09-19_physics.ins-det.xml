      <title>Robust State Estimation from Partial Out-Core Measurements with Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Nuclear Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable, real-time state estimation in nuclear reactors is of critical importance for monitoring, control and safety. It further empowers the development of digital twins that are sufficiently accurate for real-world deployment. As nuclear engineering systems are typically characterised by extreme environments, their in-core sensing is a challenging task, even more so in Generation-IV reactor concepts, which feature molten salt or liquid metals as thermal carriers. The emergence of data-driven methods allows for new techniques for accurate and robust estimation of the full state space vector characterising the reactor (mainly composed by neutron fluxes and the thermal-hydraulics fields). These techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, in order to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the Shallow Recurrent Decoder (SHRED) architecture to estimate the entire state vector of a reactor from three, out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. Specifically, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor, in the EVOL geometry (Evaluation and Viability of Liquid Fuel Fast Reactor System project), is demonstrated as a test case, with neutron flux measurements alone allowing for reconstruction of the 20 coupled field variables of the dynamics. This approach can further quantify the uncertainty associated with the state estimation due to its considerably low training cost on compressed data. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</description>

      <title>Contribution of the light-collection non-uniformity to the energy resolution for the spaghetti-type calorimeter modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spaghetti-type calorimeters (SpaCal) are being considered as a potential solution for experiments at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), particularly for the LHCb ECAL Upgrade 2 project where the expected instantaneous intensity and radiation dose in the central area of the ECAL significantly exceed the limits tolerable by the current Shashlik-type modules. SpaCal modules consist of an absorber block containing a matrix of holes filled with scintillating fibres, offering flexible granularity. However, the total number of scintillating fibres exceeds the available photocathode surface area, necessitating the use of a light guide to efficiently collect and register the light from the scintillating fibres to a single photomultiplier. This introduces non-uniformity in the light collection, which adversely impacts energy resolution.
  In this study, we explored various geometries of light guides with the optical ray-tracing simulations in order to collect scintillating light from a $30\times 30$~mm$^2$ surface to the photocathode of photomultipliers with the following entrance window: $18\times 18$~mm$^2$ (e.g. R7600), $9\times 9$~mm$^2$ (multi-anode version, e.g. R7600-M4), and round photocathode $\oslash 8$~mm (e.g. R9880). The light collection non-uniformity impact on the energy resolution is estimated.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions to intensity calculation in scintillation detectors and their application to the scintillation flash coordinates reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detectors with continuous scintillator and matrix of photomultipliers attached are widely used in modern particle physics, and various medical tomographs. There are two common ways to calculate the coordinates of the scintillation flash via photomultipliers energy outcome: Anger method and Monte Carlo simulations. In this article, we derive an analytical solution for the computation of the energy outcome from several photomultipliers built into the bottom face of the scintillation camera with a continuous scintillator shaped as a rectangular parallelepiped. The lateral faces of the scintillation camera are considered specular reflectors with reflective indexes $\sim 1$ or $0$. The analytical solution is used as a reference point for the scintillation flash coordinates reconstruction. The achieved results are similar to those the Monte Carlo simulation provides but require less computational time.</description>

      <title>Dual-comb-enhanced microwave clock synchronization over commercial fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-scale clock network is the key ingredient to obtain high precision in many scenarios, from fundamental research to cutting-edge applications. The advantage of the time synchronization among microwave clocks is their cost, size, and accessibility. Here, we demonstrate a femtosecond-level time synchronization of microwave clocks through a commercial link of 205.86 km via dual-comb-enhanced optical two-way time transfer, which achieves a 6.23-fs residual time deviation between synchronized timescales at 1 s and an instability below 6E-18 at 10,000 s. Further, the high-precision time synchronization of microwave clocks significantly enhances the probe ability of subtle reciprocity changes of fiber to the sub-picosecond level. This work provides a path toward secure fiber time-frequency networks to support future microwave-clock-based precise timing and sensing systems.</description>
