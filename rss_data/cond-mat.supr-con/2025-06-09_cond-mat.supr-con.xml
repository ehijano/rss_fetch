      <title>Axionic nonreciprocal superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonreciprocal superconductors, inversion and time-reversal symmetries are absent, which may be broken extrinsically or spontaneously. Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts a nonreciprocal superconducting state of the axionic subtype, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic vortex motion and two-dimensional superconducting transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex motion plays a central role in determining the resistance of two-dimensional superconductors, both in the context of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition and in the mixed state of type-II superconductors under magnetic fields. In this study, we introduce an anisotropic pinning potential to investigate vortex-induced resistance across the BKT transition and the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ transition. Our results demonstrate that the anisotropic pinning potential gives rise to distinct critical temperatures and upper critical fields along two orthogonal directions of current transport. These findings provide a general route toward the realization of multiple "critical temperatures" in two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Cavity-control of the Ginzburg-Landau stiffness in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confining light around solids via cavities enhances the coupling between the electromagnetic fluctuations and the matter. We predict that in superconductors this cavity-enhanced coupling enables the control of the order-parameter stiffness, which governs key length scales such as the coherence length of Cooper pairs and the magnetic penetration depth. We explain this as a renormalization of the Cooper-pair mass caused by photon-mediated repulsive interactions between the electrons building the pair. The strength of this effect can be tuned via the length of the cavity and we estimate it to be sizable for cavities in the infrared range.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Floquet fluxonium qubits with commensurable two-tone drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting superconducting qubits from low-frequency noise by operating them on dynamical sweet-spot manifolds has proven to be a promising setup, theoretically as well as experimentally . These dynamical sweet spots are induced by an externally applied Floquet drive, and various drive forms have been studied in different types of qubits. In this work we study the effects of using two-tone drives on the applied magnetic flux of the form $\phi_{ac}(t)=\phi_m\cos(m\omega_\mathrm{d} t)+\phi_n\cos(n\omega_\mathrm{d} t+\varphi)$, where $m,n \in \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$, on the coherence times of fluxonium qubits. The optimal drive parameters are found through analysis using perturbation theory and numerical calculations. We show that this type of drive allows for more tunability of the quasi-energy spectrum, creating higher and wider peaks of the dephasing time without affecting the relaxation times too strongly. Further we show that the second commensurable drive tone can be used to implement an improved phase gate compared to implementations with a single tone, supported by Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Tuning of altermagnetism by strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For all collinear altermagnets, we sort out piezomagnetic free-energy invariants allowed in the nonrelativistic limit and relativistic piezomagnetic invariants bilinear in the N\'eel vector $\mathbf{L}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, which include strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The symmetry-allowed responses are fully determined by the nonrelativistic spin Laue group. In the nonrelativistic limit, two distinct mechanisms are discussed: the band-filling mechanism, which exists in metals and is illustrated using the simple two-dimensional Lieb lattice model, and the temperature-dependent exchange-driven mechanism, which is illustrated using first-principles calculations for transition-metal fluorides. The leading second-order nonrelativistic term in the strain-induced magnetization is also obtained for CrSb. Piezomagnetism due to the strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is calculated from first principles for transition-metal fluorides, MnTe, and CrSb. Finally, we discuss triplet superconducting correlations supported by altermagnets and protected by inversion rather than time-reversal symmetry. We apply the nonrelativistic classification of Cooper pairs to describe the interplay between strain and superconductivity in the two-dimensional Lieb lattice and in bulk rutile structures. We show that triplet superconductivity is, on average, unitary in an unstrained altermagnet, but becomes non-unitary under piezomagnetically active strain.</description>

      <title>Percolative supercurrent in superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements in superconducting Al and ferromagnetic-insulator EuS bilayers. The samples display remanent spin-splitting, roughly half the superconducting gap, and supercurrent transport above the average paramagnetic limit. We interpret this behavior as arising from the interplay between two characteristic length scales: the superconducting coherence length, $\xi$, and the magnetic domain size, $d$. By comparing experimental results to a theoretical model, we find $\xi/d \approx 10$. In this regime, spin-averaging across the micromagnetic configuration can locally suppress superconductivity, resulting in percolative supercurrent flow.</description>

      <title>Topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are pivotal for engineering topological superconductivity, yet are severely hindered by orbital effects induced by in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we introduce the generic topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions (TAJJs) by leveraging the intrinsic spin-polarized band splitting and zero net magnetization attributes of altermagnets. Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital effects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the junction. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEMs emerge in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave TAJJs but vanish in the $d_{xy}$-wave configuration, thereby establishing the crystallographic orientation angle $\theta$ of the altermagnet as a novel control parameter of topology. The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs provides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved measurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our proposal extends to high-$T_c$ platforms naturally. Overall, this work establishes altermagnets as a versatile paradigm for realizing topological superconductivity, bridging conceptual innovations with scalable quantum architectures devoid of orbital effects and stray fields.</description>
