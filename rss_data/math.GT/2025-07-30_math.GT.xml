      <title>Sandwiched singularities and nearly Lefschetz fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Milnor fibers and symplectic fillings of links of sandwiched singularities, with the goal of contrasting their algebro-geometric deformation theory and symplectic topology. In the algebro-geometric setting, smoothings of sandwiched singularities are described by de Jong--van Straten's theory: all Milnor fibers are generated from deformations of a singular plane curve germ associated to the surface singularity. We develop an analog of this theory in the symplectic setting, showing that all minimal symplectic fillings of the links are generated by certain immersed disk arrangements resembling de Jong--van Straten's picture deformations. This paper continues our previous work for a special subclass of singularities; the general case has additional difficulties and new features. The key new ingredient in the present paper is given by spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations: we use recent work of Roy--Min--Wang to understand symplectic fillings and encode them via multisections of certain Lefschetz fibrations. As an application, we discuss arrangements that generate unexpected Stein fillings that are different from all Milnor fibers, showing that the links of a large class of sandwiched singularities admit unexpected fillings.</description>

      <title>Swan modules and homotopy types after a single stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Swan modules, which are a special class of projective modules over integral group rings, and their consequences for the homotopy classification of CW-complexes. We show that there exists a non-free stably free Swan module, thus resolving Problem A4 in the 1979 Problem List of C. T. C. Wall. As an application we show that, in all dimensions $n \equiv 3$ mod $4$, there exist finite $n$-complexes which are homotopy equivalent after stabilising with multiple copies of $S^n$, but not after a single stabilisation. This answers a question of M. N. Dyer.
  We also resolve a question of S. Plotnick concerning Swan modules associated to group automorphisms and, as an application, obtain a short and direct proof that there exists a group with $k$-periodic cohomology which does not have free period $k$. In contrast to the original proof our R. J. Milgram, our proof circumvents the need to compute the Swan finiteness obstruction.</description>

      <title>The induced metric and bending lamination on the boundary of convex hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an oriented closed surface of genus at least two, and let $M = S \times (0,1)$. Suppose that $h$ is a Riemannian metric on $S$ with curvature strictly greater than $-1$, $h^{*}$ is a Riemannian metric on $S$ with curvature strictly less than $1$, and every contractible closed geodesic with respect to $h^{*}$ has length strictly greater than $2\pi$. Let $\mu$ be a measured lamination on $S$ such that every closed leaf has weight strictly less than $\pi$. Then, we prove the existence of a convex hyperbolic metric $g$ on the interior of $M$ that induces the Riemannian metric $h$ (respectively $h^{*}$) as the first (respectively third) fundamental form on $S \times \left\{ 0\right\}$ and induces a pleated surface structure on $S \times \left\{ 1\right\}$ with bending lamination $\mu$. This statement remains valid even in limiting cases where the curvature of $h$ is constant and equal to $-1$. Additionally, when considering a conformal class $c$ on $S$, we show that there exists a convex hyperbolic metric $g$ on the interior of $M$ that induces $c$ on $S \times \left\{ 0\right\}$, which is viewed as one component of the ideal boundary at infinity of $(M,g)$, and induces a pleated surface structure on $S \times \left\{ 1\right\}$ with bending lamination $\mu$. Our proof differs from previous work by Lecuire for these two last cases. Moreover, when we consider a lamination which is small enough, in a sense that we will define, and a hyperbolic metric, we show that the metric on the interior of $M$ that realizes these data is unique.</description>

      <title>Computing Finite Type Invariants Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an efficient algorithm to compute finite type invariants of type $k$ by first creating, for a given knot $K$ with $n$ crossings, a look-up table for all subdiagrams of $K$ of size $\lceil \frac{k}{2}\rceil$ indexed by dyadic intervals in $[0,2n-1]$. Using this algorithm, any such finite type invariant can be computed on an $n$-crossing knot in time $\tilde{O}( n^{\lceil \frac{k}{2}\rceil})$, a lot faster than the previously best published bound of $\tilde{O} (n^k)$.</description>

      <title>Corks, exotic 4-manifolds and genus functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18584v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every 4-dimensional oriented handlebody without 3- and 4-handles can be modified to admit infinitely many exotic smooth structures, and further that their genus functions are pairwise equivalent. We furthermore show that, for any 4-manifold admitting an embedding into a symplectic 4-manifold with weakly convex boundary, its genus function is algebraically realized as those of infinitely many pairwise exotic 4-manifolds. We also prove that, for any two 4-manifolds with non-degenerate intersection forms, algebraic inequivalences of genus functions are stable under connected sums and boundary sums with a certain type of 4-manifolds having arbitrarily large second Betti numbers. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of genus function type for diffeomorphism invariants and show that similar results hold for any such invariant. As an application of our exotic 4-manifolds, we also prove that for any (possibly non-orientable) 4-manifold, every submanifold of codimension less than two satisfying a mild condition can be modified to admit infinitely many exotically knotted copies.</description>

      <title>The geometry of conjugation in Euclidean isometry groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the geometry of conjugation within any split subgroup $H$ of the full isometry group $G$ of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. We prove that for any $h \in H$, the conjugacy class $[h]_H$ of $h$ is described geometrically by the move-set of its linearization, while the set of elements conjugating $h$ to a given $h'\in [h]_H$ is described by the the fix-set of its linearization. Examples include all affine Coxeter groups, certain crystallographic groups, and the group $G$ itself.</description>
