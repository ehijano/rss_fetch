      <title>Directional Poincar\'e inequality on compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the directional Poincar\'e inequality on the torus, introduced by Steinerberger in [Ark. Mat. 54 (2016), pp. 555--569], to the setting of compact Lie groups. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such an inequality based on estimates on the eigenvalues of the global symbol of the corresponding vector field. We also prove that such refinement of the Poincar\'e inequality holds for a left-invariant vector field on a compact Lie group $G$ if and only if the vector field is globally solvable, and extend this equivalence to tube-type vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^1\times G$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantum ergodic restriction (QER) theorem for real hypersurfaces $\Sigma \subset X,$ where $X$ is the Grauert tube associated with a real-analytic, compact Riemannian manifold. As an application, we obtain $h$ independent upper and lower bounds for the $L^2$ - restrictions of the FBI transform of Laplace eigenfunctions restricted to $\Sigma$ satisfying certain generic geometric conditions.</description>

      <title>Bilinear embedding for divergence-form operators with negative potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ be open, $A$ a complex uniformly strictly accretive $d\times d$ matrix-valued function on $\Omega$ with $L^\infty$ coefficients, and $V$ a locally integrable function on $\Omega$ whose negative part is subcritical. We consider the operator $\mathscr{L} = -\mathrm{div}(A\nabla) + V$ with mixed boundary conditions on $\Omega$. We extend the bilinear inequality of Carbonaro and Dragi\v{c}evi\'c [15], originally established for nonnegative potentials, by introducing a novel condition on the coefficients that reduces to standard $p$-ellipticity when $V$ is nonnegative. As a consequence, we show that the solution to the parabolic problem $u'(t) + \mathscr{L} u(t) = f(t)$ with $u(0)=0$ has maximal regularity on $L^p(\Omega)$, in the same spirit as [13]. Moreover, we study mapping properties of the semigroup generated by $-\mathscr{L}$ under this new condition, thereby extending classical results for the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $-\Delta + V$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ [8,47].</description>

      <title>A contractible Schiffer counterexample on the half-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of a family of nontrivial smooth contractible domains on the sphere that admit Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian which are constant on the boundary. These domains are contained on the half-sphere, in stark contrast with the rigidity literature for Serrin-type problems. The proof relies on a local bifurcation argument around the family of geodesic disks centered at the north pole. We combine the use of anisotropic H\"older spaces for the functional setting with computer-assisted techniques to check the bifurcation conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Gaffney and Korn inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a homogeneous, quantitative version of Ehrling's inequality for the function spaces $H^1(\Omega)\subset\subset L^2(\partial\Omega)$, $H^1(\Omega)\hookrightarrow L^2(\Omega)$ which reflects geometric properties of a given $C^{1,1}$-domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$.
  We use this result to derive quantitative homogeneous versions of Gaffney's inequality, of relevance in electromagnetism as well as Korn's inequality, of relevance in elasticity theory.
  The main difference to the corresponding classical results is that the constants appearing in our inequalities turn out to be dimensional constants. We provide explicit upper bounds for these constants and show that in the case of the tangential homogeneous Korn inequality our upper bound is asymptotically sharp as $n\rightarrow \infty$.
  Lastly, we raise the question of the optimal values of these dimensional constants.</description>

      <title>Eigenstructure of the linearized electrical impedance tomography problem under radial perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Fr\'echet derivative $F$, that maps a perturbation in conductivity to the linearized change in boundary measurements governed by the conductivity equation. The domain is taken to be the unit ball $B \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$, and we choose perturbations $\eta$ from the Hilbert space $L^2(B)$. Under the condition that the perturbations are rotationally symmetric, we show that the eigenfunctions of the linear approximation $F \eta$ correspond to the spherical harmonics. Furthermore, we establish an explicit formula for the associated eigenvalues and show that for perturbations from any bounded subset, the decay of these eigenvalues is uniform with respect to the degree of the spherical harmonics. The established structure of $F \eta$ enables us to show that the Fr\'echet derivative $F$ can be approximated by finite-rank operators when restricted to rotationally symmetric perturbations. Both the extension to $L^2(B)$ perturbations and the approximability by finite-rank operators are favorable properties for further analysis of $F$ in numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Estimates of a possible gap related to the energy equality for a class of non-Newtonian fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the 3D-initial value problem for power-law fluids with shear dependent viscosity in a spatially periodic domain. The goal is the construction of a weak solution enjoying an energy equality. The results hold assuming an initial data $v_0\in J^2(\Omega)$ and for $p\in \left(\frac 95,2\right)$. It is interesting to observe that the result is in complete agreement with the one known for the Navier-Stokes equations. Further, in both cases, the additional dissipation, which measures the possible gap with the classical energy equality, is only expressed in terms of energy quantities.</description>

      <title>Existence and Nonexistence Breaking Results For a Weighted Elliptic Problem in Half-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the problem $-\mathrm{div}(\rho(x_N)\nabla u)=a|u|^{p-2}u$ in $\mathbb{R}^N_+$, $-\partial u/\partial x_N=b|u|^{q-2}u$ in $\mathbb{R}^{N-1}$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, $p,q\in (1,\infty)$ and $\rho$ is a positive weight. We establish regularity results for weak solutions and, using a variational approach combined with a new Pohozaev-type identity, we show that the introduction of the weighted operator $-\mathrm{div}(\rho(x_N)\nabla u)$ can reverse the known solvability behavior of the classical Laplacian case. Specifically, we identify regimes where the problem admits solutions despite nonexistence for the corresponding case with $-\Delta$, and vice versa, thus inverting the classical existence and nonexistence results.</description>

      <title>Energy equality of the weak solutions to the fractional Navier-Stokes / MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of energy equality for weak solutions of the 3D incompressible fractional Navier-Stokes / MHD equations. With the help of the technique of symmetrization and interpolation method, we obtain some new sufficient conditions including the Sobolev multiplier spaces, which insures the validity of the energy equality of the weak solution to fractional MHD equations. Correspondingly, the results of fractional Navier-Stokes equations are obtained. And these energy equations are usually related to the uniqueness of solutions to the corresponding fractional Navier-Stokes / MHD equations.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic-statistical inference of mosquito dynamics from mark-release-recapture data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological control strategies against mosquito-borne diseases--such as the sterile insect technique (SIT), RIDL, and Wolbachia-based releases--require reliable estimates of dispersal and survival of released males. We propose a mechanistic--statistical framework for mark--release--recapture (MRR) data linking an individual-based 2D diffusion model with its reaction--diffusion limit. Inference is based on solving the macroscopic system and embedding it in a Poisson observation model for daily trap counts, with uncertainty quantified via a parametric bootstrap. We validate identifiability using simulated data and apply the model to an urban MRR campaign in El Cano (Havana, Cuba) involving four weekly releases of sterile Aedes aegypti males. The best-supported model suggests a mean life expectancy of about five days and a typical displacement of about 180 m. Unlike empirical fits of survival or dispersal, our mechanistic approach jointly estimates movement, mortality, and capture, yielding biologically interpretable parameters and a principled framework for designing and evaluating SIT-based interventions.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle for a stochastic nonlinear damped Schrodinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper focuses on the stochastic nonlinear Schrodinger equation with polynomial nonlinearity, and a zero-order (no derivatives involved) linear damping. Here, the random forcing term appears as a mix of a nonlinear noise in the Ito sense and a linear multiplicative noise in the Stratonovich sense. We prove the Laplace principle for the family of solutions to the stochastic system in a suitable Polish space, using the weak convergence framework of Budhiraja and Dupuis. This analysis is nontrivial, since it requires uniform estimates for the solutions of the associated controlled stochastic equation in the underlying solution space in order to verify the weak convergence criterion. The Wentzell Freidlin type large deviation principle is proved using Varadhan's lemma and Bryc's converse to Varadhan's lemma. The local well-posedness of the skeleton equation (deterministic controlled system) is established by employing the Banach fixed point theorem, and the global well posedness is established via Yosida approximation. We show that the conservation law holds in the absence of the linear damping and Ito noise. The well posedness of the stochastic controlled equation is also nontrivial in this case. We use a truncation method, a stopping time argument, and the Yosida technique to get the global well-posedness of the stochastic controlled equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional elastostatic inclusion problem in an unbounded medium. Building on the recent developments for rigid inclusions \cite{Mattei:2021:EAS} and conductivity inclusions \cite{Jung:2021:SEL}, we extend these methodologies to the more general case of elastic inclusions with arbitrary Lam\'{e} constants. Our approach integrates layer potential techniques, geometric function theory, and the complex-variable formulation in plane elasticity. As a main result, we derive a matrix formulation of the elastostatic inclusion problem using basis functions defined via the exterior conformal mapping of the inclusion. This leads to a series solution framework that incorporates the geometry of the inclusion.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds for the operator pencil of an elliptic system in an angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model problem of a plane angle for a second-order elliptic system subject to Dirichlet, mixed, and Neumann boundary conditions is analyzed. For each boundary condition, the existence of solutions of the form $r^\lambda v$ is reduced to spectral analysis of a particular matrix. Focusing on Dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions, optimal bounds on $|\Re \lambda|$ are derived, employing tools from numerical range analysis and accretive operator theory. The developed framework is novel and recovers known bounds for Dirichlet boundary conditions. The results for mixed boundary conditions are new and represent the central contribution of this work. Immediate applications of these findings are new regularity results for linear second-order elliptic systems subject to mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Global stability for compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in 3D bounded domains with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global stability of large solutions to the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain with Navier-slip boundary conditions. It is shown that the strong solutions converge to an equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^2$-norm provided the density is essentially uniform-in-time bounded from above. Moreover, we obtain that the density converges to its equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^\infty$-norm if additionally the initial density is bounded away from zero. Furthermore, we derive that the vacuum states will not vanish for any time provided vacuum appears (even at a point) initially. This is the first result concerning the global stability for large strong solutions of compressible Navier-Stokes equations with vacuum in 3D general bounded domains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider notions of weak solutions to a general class of parabolic problems of linear growth, formulated independently of time regularity. Equivalence with variational solutions is established using a stability result for weak solutions. A key tool in our arguments is approximation of parabolic BV functions using time mollification and Sobolev approximations. We also prove a comparison principle and a local boundedness result for solutions. When the time derivative of the solution is in $L^2$ our definitions are equivalent with the definition based on the Anzellotti pairing.</description>

      <title>Global stability for the compressible isentropic magnetohydrodynamic equations in 3D bounded domains with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the global stability of large solutions to the compressible isentropic magnetohydrodynamic equations in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain with Navier-slip boundary conditions. It is shown that the solutions converge to an equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^2$-norm provided the density is essentially uniform-in-time bounded from above. Moreover, we also obtain that the density and magnetic field converge to their equilibrium states exponentially in the $L^\infty$-norm if additionally the initial density is bounded away from zero. These greatly improve the previous work in (J. Differential Equations 288 (2021), 1-39), where the authors considered the torus case and required the $L^6$-norm of the magnetic field to be uniformly bounded as well as zero initial total momentum and an additional restriction $2\mu&gt;\lambda$ for the viscous coefficients. This paper provides the first global stability result for large strong solutions of compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations in 3D general bounded domains.</description>

Abstract: Given any $f$ a locally finitely piecewise affine homeomorphism of $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ onto $\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ (for $d=3, 4$) such that $f\in W^{1,p}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^d)$ and $f^{-1}\in W^{1,q}(\Delta, \mathbb{R}^d)$, $1\leq p ,q &lt; \infty$ and any $\epsilon &gt;0$ we construct a diffeomorphism $\tilde{f}$ such that
  $$\|f-\tilde{f}\|_{W^{1,p}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^d)} + \|f^{-1}-\tilde{f}^{-1}\|_{W^{1,q}(\Delta,\mathbb{R}^d)} &lt; \epsilon.$$</description>

      <title>Estimates for harmonic functions near pseudo-corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that derivatives of solutions to elliptic boundary value problems may become unbounded near the corner of a domain with a conical singularity, even if the data are smooth. When the corner domain is approximated by more regular domains, then higher order Sobolev norms of the solutions on these domains can blow up in the limit. We study this blow-up in the simple example of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet conditions in two situations: The rounding of a corner in any dimension, and the two-dimensional situation where a polygonal corner is replaced by two or more corners with smaller angles. We show how an inner expansion derived from a more general recent result on converging expansions into generalized power series can be employed to prove simple and explicit estimations for Sobolev norms and singularity coefficients by powers of the approximation scale.</description>

      <title>On a class of thin obstacle-type problems for the bi-Laplacian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the regularity of solutions and structural properties of the free boundary for a class of fourth-order elliptic problems with Neumann-type boundary conditions. The singular and degenerate elliptic operators studied naturally emerge from the extension procedure for higher-order fractional powers of the Laplacian, while the choice of non-linearity considered encompasses two-phase boundary obstacle problems as a special case. After establishing local regularity properties of solutions, Almgren- and Monneau-type monotonicity formulas are derived and utilized to carry out a blow-up analysis and prove a stratification result for the free boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose--Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type. In the first paper of the series, we focus on the local problem of the form $\Delta u = u(u^2+v^2-1) + v(\alpha uv - \omega)$, $\Delta v = v(u^2+v^2-1) + u(\alpha uv - \omega)$, and prove that positive global solutions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying $\partial u/\partial x_3 &gt; 0 &gt; \partial v/\partial x_3$ must be one-dimensional.</description>

      <title>The effect of "very fast" dispersal on two species competition with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical theory predicts that for two competing populations subject to a constant downstream drift, the faster disperser will competitively exclude the slower disperser. In the current work, we consider a novel model of a "much faster" dispersing species, modeled via a $p$-Laplacian operator, competing with a slower disperser. We prove global existence of weak solutions to this model for any positive initial condition, in the regime $\frac{3}{2} &lt; p &lt;2$. Counterintuitively, we show that while the faster disperser always wins - the "much faster" disperser could actually lose, for certain initial data. Several numerical simulations are conducted to confirm our analytical findings. Our results have implications for biodiversity, refuge design, and improved biological control, driven by habitat fragmentation and climate change.</description>

      <title>On the existence of fibered three-dimensional perfect fluid equilibria without continuous Euclidean symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following Lortz, we construct a family of smooth steady states of the ideal, incompressible Euler equation in three dimensions that possess no continuous Euclidean symmetry. As in Lortz, they do possess a planar reflection symmetry and, as such, all the orbits of the velocity are closed. Different from Lortz, our construction has a discrete m-fold symmetry and is foliated by invariant cylindrical level sets of a non-degenerate Bernoulli pressure. Such examples narrow the scope of validity of Grad's conjecture that the only solutions with a continuous symmetry can be fibered by pressure surfaces.</description>

      <title>A general nonuniqueness result for Yamabe-type problems for conformally variational Riemannian invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a conformally variational scalar Riemannian invariant $I$, we identify a sufficient condition for a compact Riemannian manifold to admit finite regular coverings with many nonhomothetic conformal rescalings with $I$ constant. We also identify a sufficient condition for the universal cover to admit infinitely many geometrically distinct periodic conformal rescalings with $I$ constant. Using these conditions, we improve known nonuniqueness results for the $Q$-curvatures of orders two, four, and six, and establish nonuniqueness results for higher-order $Q$-curvatures and renormalized volume coefficients.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on Malliavin calculus in regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Malliavin calculus provides a characterization of the centered model in regularity structures that is stable under removing the small-scale cut-off. In conjunction with a spectral gap inequality, it yields the stochastic estimates of the model.
  This becomes transparent on the level of a notion of model that parameterizes the solution manifold, and thus is indexed by multi-indices rather than trees, and which allows for a more geometric than combinatorial perspective. In these lecture notes, this is carried out for a PDE with heat operator, a cubic nonlinearity, and driven by additive noise, reminiscent of the stochastic quantization of the Euclidean $\phi^4$ model.
  More precisely, we informally motivate our notion of the model $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ as charts and transition maps, respectively, of the nonlinear solution manifold. These geometric objects are algebrized in terms of formal power series, and their algebra automorphisms. We will assimilate the directional Malliavin derivative to a tangent vector of the solution manifold. This means that it can be treated as a modelled distribution, thereby connecting stochastic model estimates to pathwise solution theory, with its analytic tools of reconstruction and integration. We unroll an inductive calculus that in an automated way applies to the full subcritical regime.</description>

      <title>The measures with $L^2$-bounded Riesz transform and the Painlev\'e problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a geometric characterization of the measures $\mu$ in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ with polynomial upper growth of degree $n$ such that the $n$-dimensional Riesz transform $R\mu (x) = \int \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^{n+1}}\,d\mu(y)$ belongs to $L^2(\mu)$. More precisely, it is shown that $$\|R\mu\|_{L^2(\mu)}^2 + \|\mu\|\approx \int\!\!\int_0^\infty \beta_{2,\mu}(x,r)^2\,\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{r^n}\,\frac{dr}r\,d\mu(x) + \|\mu\|,$$ where $\beta_{\mu,2}(x,r)^2 = \inf_L \frac1{r^n}\int_{B(x,r)} \left(\frac{\mathrm{dist}(y,L)}r\right)^2\,d\mu(y),$ with the infimum taken over all affine $n$-planes $L\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$. As a corollary, we obtain a characterization of the removable sets for Lipschitz harmonic functions in terms of a metric-geometric potential and we deduce that the class of removable sets for Lipschitz harmonic functions is invariant by bilipschitz mappings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a finite-time stochastic drift control problem with the assumption that the control is bounded and the system is controlled until the state process leaves the half-line. Assuming general conditions, it is proved that the resulting parabolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation has a classical solution. In fact, we consider an even more general family of semilinear equations, which might be helpful in solving other control or game problems. Not only is the existence result proved, but also a recursive procedure for finding a solution resulting from a fixed-point argument is provided. An application to the dividend optimization problem is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main theorem of this paper states that the c-convexity and the alternative c-convexity are equivalent if and only if the cost function c satisfies MTW condition. The alternative c-convex function is an analogy of the definition of the convex function that is using the inequality phi(t x1 + (1 - t) x0) &lt;= t phi(x1) + (1 - t) phi(x0). We study properties of the alternative c-convex functions and MTW condition, then prove the main theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous study (Ishida, 2025), the author proved the uniqueness of short-range potential functions using the Enss-Weder time-dependent method (Enss and Weder, 1995) for a two-body quantum system described by time-decaying harmonic oscillators. In this study, we extend the result of Ishida (2025) to the $N$-body case. We use the approaches developed in Enss and Weder (1995), Weder (1996), and Valencia and Weder (2012) to prove that the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator uniquely determines all the pairwise interaction potentials among the $N$ particles, focusing respectively on each fixed pair of particles.</description>
