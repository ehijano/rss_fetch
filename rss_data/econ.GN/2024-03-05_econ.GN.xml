      <title>Uncovering the Sino-US dynamic risk spillovers effects: Evidence from agricultural futures markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agricultural products play a critical role in human development. With economic globalization and the financialization of agricultural products continuing to advance, the interconnections between different agricultural futures have become closer. We utilize a TVP-VAR-DY model combined with the quantile method to measure the risk spillover between 11 agricultural futures on the futures exchanges of US and China from July 9,2014, to December 31,2022. This study yielded several significant findings. Firstly, CBOT corn, soybean, and wheat were identified as the primary risk transmitters, with DCE corn and soybean as the main risk receivers. Secondly, sudden events or increased eco- nomic uncertainty can increase the overall risk spillovers. Thirdly, there is an aggregation of risk spillovers amongst agricultural futures based on the dynamic directional spillover results. Lastly, the central agricultural futures under the conditional mean are CBOT corn and soybean, while CZCE hard wheat and long-grained rice are the two risk spillover centers in extreme cases, as per the results of the spillover network and minimum spanning tree. Based on these results, decision-makers are advised to safeguard against the price risk of agricultural futures under sudden economic events, and investors can utilize the results to construct a superior investment portfolio by taking different agricultural product futures as risk-leading indicators according to various situations.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Generative AI: Does ChatGPT Really Increase Everyone's Productivity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and MidJourney have made remarkable progress in recent years. Recent literature has documented ChatGPT's positive impact on productivity in areas where it has strong expertise, attributable to extensive training datasets, such as the English language and Python/SQL programming. However, there is still limited literature regarding ChatGPT's performance in areas where its capabilities could still be further enhanced. This paper aims to fill this gap. We conducted an experiment in which economics students were asked to perform writing analysis tasks in a non-English language (specifically, Thai) and math &amp; data analysis tasks using a less frequently used programming package (specifically, Stata). The findings suggest that, on average, participants performed better using ChatGPT in terms of scores and time taken to complete the tasks. However, a detailed examination reveals that 34% of participants saw no improvement in writing analysis tasks, and 42% did not improve in math &amp; data analysis tasks when employing ChatGPT. Further investigation indicated that higher-ability students, as proxied by their econometrics grades, were the ones who performed worse in writing analysis tasks when using ChatGPT. We also found evidence that students with better digital skills performed better with ChatGPT. This research provides insights on the impact of generative AI. Thus, stakeholders can make informed decisions to implement appropriate policy frameworks or redesign educational systems. It also highlights the critical role of human skills in addressing and complementing the limitations of technology.</description>

      <title>The Heterogeneous Productivity Effects of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the individual productivity effects of Italy's ban on ChatGPT, a generative pretrained transformer chatbot. We compile data on the daily coding output quantity and quality of over 36,000 GitHub users in Italy and other European countries and combine these data with the sudden announcement of the ban in a difference-in-differences framework. Among the affected users in Italy, we find a short-term increase in output quantity and quality for less experienced users and a decrease in productivity on more routine tasks for experienced users.</description>

      <title>"Digitwashing": The Gap between Words and Deeds in Digital Transformation and Stock Price Crash Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contrast between companies' "fleshy" promises and the "skeletal" performance in digital transformation may lead to a higher risk of stock price crash. This paper selects a sample of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2021, empirically analyses the specific impact of the gap between words and deeds in digital transformation (GDT) on the stock price crash risk, and explores the possible causes of GDT. We found that GDT significantly increases the stock price crash risk, and this finding is still valid after a series of robustness tests. In a further study, a deeper examination of the causes of GDT reveals that firms' perceptions of economic policy uncertainty significantly increase GDT, and the effect is more pronounced in the sample of loss-making firms. At the same time, the results of the heterogeneity test suggest that investors are more tolerant of state-owned enterprises when they are in the GDT situation. Taken together, we provide a concrete bridge between the two measures of digital transformation - digital text frequency and digital technology share - and offer new insights to enhance capital market stability.</description>

      <title>Bandit Profit-maximization for Targeted Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential profit-maximization problem, optimizing for both price and ancillary variables like marketing expenditures. Specifically, we aim to maximize profit over an arbitrary sequence of multiple demand curves, each dependent on a distinct ancillary variable, but sharing the same price. A prototypical example is targeted marketing, where a firm (seller) wishes to sell a product over multiple markets. The firm may invest different marketing expenditures for different markets to optimize customer acquisition, but must maintain the same price across all markets. Moreover, markets may have heterogeneous demand curves, each responding to prices and marketing expenditures differently. The firm's objective is to maximize its gross profit, the total revenue minus marketing costs.
  Our results are near-optimal algorithms for this class of problems in an adversarial bandit setting, where demand curves are arbitrary non-adaptive sequences, and the firm observes only noisy evaluations of chosen points on the demand curves. We prove a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(nT^{3/4}\big)$ and a lower bound of $\Omega\big((nT)^{3/4}\big)$ for monotonic demand curves, and a regret bound of $\widetilde{\Theta}\big(nT^{2/3}\big)$ for demands curves that are monotonic in price and concave in the ancillary variables.</description>

      <title>Talent Hoarding in Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most organizations rely on managers to identify talented workers. However, managers who are evaluated on team performance have an incentive to hoard workers. This study provides the first empirical evidence of talent hoarding using personnel records and survey evidence from a large manufacturing firm. Talent hoarding is reported by three-fourths of managers, is detectable in managerial decisions, and occurs more frequently when hoarding incentives are stronger. Using quasi-random variation in exposure to talent hoarding, I demonstrate that hoarding deters workers from applying to new positions, inhibiting worker career progression and altering the allocation of talent in the firm.</description>
