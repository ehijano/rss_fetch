      <description>arXiv:2410.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent with momentum is a popular variant of stochastic gradient descent, which has recently been reported to have a close relationship with the underdamped Langevin diffusion. In this paper, we establish a quantitative error estimate between them in the 1-Wasserstein and total variation distances.</description>

      <title>Scalable Implicit Graphon Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphons are continuous models that represent the structure of graphs and allow the generation of graphs of varying sizes. We propose Scalable Implicit Graphon Learning (SIGL), a scalable method that combines implicit neural representations (INRs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate a graphon from observed graphs. Unlike existing methods, which face important limitations like fixed resolution and scalability issues, SIGL learns a continuous graphon at arbitrary resolutions. GNNs are used to determine the correct node ordering, improving graph alignment. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic consistency of our estimator, showing that more expressive INRs and GNNs lead to consistent estimators. We evaluate SIGL in synthetic and real-world graphs, showing that it outperforms existing methods and scales effectively to larger graphs, making it ideal for tasks like graph data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Semi-Implicit Functional Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) use non-parametric variational families represented by particles to approximate the target distribution according to the kernelized Wasserstein gradient flow for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Recent works introduce functional gradient flows to substitute the kernel for better flexibility. However, the deterministic updating mechanism may suffer from limited exploration and require expensive repetitive runs for new samples. In this paper, we propose Semi-Implicit Functional Gradient flow (SIFG), a functional gradient ParVI method that uses perturbed particles as the approximation family. The corresponding functional gradient flow, which can be estimated via denoising score matching, exhibits strong theoretical convergence guarantee. We also present an adaptive version of our method to automatically choose the suitable noise magnitude. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework on both simulated and real data problems.</description>

      <title>An Effective Theory of Bias Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models may capture and amplify biases present in data, leading to disparate test performance across social groups. To better understand, evaluate, and mitigate these possible biases, a deeper theoretical understanding of how model design choices and data distribution properties could contribute to bias is needed. In this work, we contribute a precise analytical theory in the context of ridge regression, both with and without random projections, where the former models neural networks in a simplified regime. Our theory offers a unified and rigorous explanation of machine learning bias, providing insights into phenomena such as bias amplification and minority-group bias in various feature and parameter regimes. For example, we demonstrate that there may be an optimal regularization penalty or training time to avoid bias amplification, and there can be fundamental differences in test error between groups that do not vanish with increased parameterization. Importantly, our theoretical predictions align with several empirical observations reported in the literature. We extensively empirically validate our theory on diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise and large dataset concerning catastrophic events is very important for insurers. To improve the quality of such data three methods based on the bootstrap, bootknife, and GAN algorithms are proposed. Using numerical experiments and real-life data, simulated outputs for these approaches are compared based on the mean squared (MSE) and mean absolute errors (MAE). Then, a direct algorithm to construct a fuzzy expert's opinion concerning such outputs is also considered.</description>

      <title>Computing Optimal Regularizers for Online Linear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms are a popular class of learning algorithms for online linear optimization (OLO) that guarantee sub-linear regret, but the choice of regularizer can significantly impact dimension-dependent factors in the regret bound. We present an algorithm that takes as input convex and symmetric action sets and loss sets for a specific OLO instance, and outputs a regularizer such that running FTRL with this regularizer guarantees regret within a universal constant factor of the best possible regret bound. In particular, for any choice of (convex, symmetric) action set and loss set we prove that there exists an instantiation of FTRL which achieves regret within a constant factor of the best possible learning algorithm, strengthening the universality result of Srebro et al., 2011.
  Our algorithm requires preprocessing time and space exponential in the dimension $d$ of the OLO instance, but can be run efficiently online assuming a membership and linear optimization oracle for the action and loss sets, respectively (and is fully polynomial time for the case of constant dimension $d$). We complement this with a lower bound showing that even deciding whether a given regularizer is $\alpha$-strongly-convex with respect to a given norm is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multi-Agent Constrained Stochastic Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a collaborative multi-agent stochastic linear bandit setting involving a network of $N$ agents that communicate locally to minimize their collective regret while keeping their expected cost under a specified threshold $\tau$. Each agent encounters a distinct linear bandit problem characterized by its own reward and cost parameters, i.e., local parameters. The goal of the agents is to determine the best overall action corresponding to the average of these parameters, or so-called global parameters. In each round, an agent is randomly chosen to select an action based on its current knowledge of the system. This chosen action is then executed by all agents, then they observe their individual rewards and costs. We propose a safe distributed upper confidence bound algorithm, so called \textit{MA-OPLB}, and establish a high probability bound on its $T$-round regret. MA-OPLB utilizes an accelerated consensus method, where agents can compute an estimate of the average rewards and costs across the network by communicating the proper information with their neighbors. We show that our regret bound is of order $ \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{d}{\tau-c_0}\frac{\log(NT)^2}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$, where $\lambda_2$ is the second largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of the communication matrix, and $\tau-c_0$ is the known cost gap of a feasible action. We also experimentally show the performance of our proposed algorithm in different network structures.</description>

      <title>Learning Graph Filters for Structure-Function Coupling based Hub Node Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, tools from network science have been leveraged to characterize the organization of both structural and functional networks of the brain. One such measure of network organization is hub node identification. Hubs are specialized nodes within a network that link distinct brain units corresponding to specialized functional processes. Conventional methods for identifying hub nodes utilize different types of centrality measures and participation coefficient to profile various aspects of nodal importance. These methods solely rely on the functional connectivity networks constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ignoring the structure-function coupling in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing (GSP) based hub detection framework that utilizes both the structural connectivity and the functional activation to identify hub nodes. The proposed framework models functional activity as graph signals on the structural connectivity. Hub nodes are then detected based on the premise that hub nodes are sparse, have higher level of activity compared to their neighbors, and the non-hub nodes' activity can be modeled as the output of a graph-based filter. Based on these assumptions, an optimization framework, GraFHub, is formulated to learn the coefficients of the optimal polynomial graph filter and detect the hub nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated data and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from Human Connectome Project (HCP).</description>

      <title>Ranking of Multi-Response Experiment Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic ranking model to identify the optimal treatment in multiple-response experiments. In contemporary practice, treatments are applied over individuals with the goal of achieving multiple ideal properties on them simultaneously. However, often there are competing properties, and the optimality of one cannot be achieved without compromising the optimality of another. Typically, we still want to know which treatment is the overall best. In our framework, we first formulate overall optimality in terms of treatment ranks. Then we infer the latent ranking that allow us to report treatments from optimal to least optimal, provided ideal desirable properties. We demonstrate through simulations and real data analysis how we can achieve reliability of inferred ranks in practice. We adopt a Bayesian approach and derive an associated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit our model to data. Finally, we discuss the prospects of adoption of our method as a standard tool for experiment evaluation in trials-based research.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Representation and Model Learning for Latent Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning identifiable representations and models from low-level observations is useful for an intelligent spacecraft to reliability finish downstream tasks. For temporal observations, to ensure that the data generating process is provably inverted, most existing works either assume the noise variables in the dynamic mechanisms are (conditionally) independent, or require interventions which can directly affect each latent variable. However, in practice, the relationship between the exogenous inputs/interventions and the latent variables may follow some complex deterministic mechanisms. In this work, we study the problem of identifiable representation and model learning for latent dynamic systems. The key idea is that we use an inductive bias inspired by controllable canonical forms, which is invariant, sparse, and input dependent by definition. We prove that, for linear or affine nonlinear latent dynamic systems, it is possible to identify the representations up to scaling and determine the models up to some simple transformations. The results have potential to provide some theoretical guarantees for developing more trustworthy decision-making and control methods for intelligent spacecrafts.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning under Latent Dynamics: Toward Statistical and Algorithmic Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world applications of reinforcement learning often involve environments where agents operate on complex, high-dimensional observations, but the underlying (''latent'') dynamics are comparatively simple. However, outside of restrictive settings such as small latent spaces, the fundamental statistical requirements and algorithmic principles for reinforcement learning under latent dynamics are poorly understood.
  This paper addresses the question of reinforcement learning under $\textit{general}$ latent dynamics from a statistical and algorithmic perspective. On the statistical side, our main negative result shows that most well-studied settings for reinforcement learning with function approximation become intractable when composed with rich observations; we complement this with a positive result, identifying latent pushforward coverability as a general condition that enables statistical tractability. Algorithmically, we develop provably efficient observable-to-latent reductions -- that is, reductions that transform an arbitrary algorithm for the latent MDP into an algorithm that can operate on rich observations -- in two settings: one where the agent has access to hindsight observations of the latent dynamics [LADZ23], and one where the agent can estimate self-predictive latent models [SAGHCB20]. Together, our results serve as a first step toward a unified statistical and algorithmic theory for reinforcement learning under latent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for model correction of dynamical systems with data scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep learning framework for correcting existing dynamical system models utilizing only a scarce high-fidelity data set. In many practical situations, one has a low-fidelity model that can capture the dynamics reasonably well but lacks high resolution, due to the inherent limitation of the model and the complexity of the underlying physics. When high resolution data become available, it is natural to seek model correction to improve the resolution of the model predictions. We focus on the case when the amount of high-fidelity data is so small that most of the existing data driven modeling methods cannot be applied. In this paper, we address these challenges with a model-correction method which only requires a scarce high-fidelity data set. Our method first seeks a deep neural network (DNN) model to approximate the existing low-fidelity model. By using the scarce high-fidelity data, the method then corrects the DNN model via transfer learning (TL). After TL, an improved DNN model with high prediction accuracy to the underlying dynamics is obtained. One distinct feature of the propose method is that it does not assume a specific form of the model correction terms. Instead, it offers an inherent correction to the low-fidelity model via TL. A set of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Spectral Moments of the Kernel Integral Operator from Finite Sample Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17998v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the structure of sampled features from an input data distribution is challenging when constrained by limited measurements in both the number of inputs and features. Traditional approaches often rely on the eigenvalue spectrum of the sample covariance matrix derived from finite measurement matrices; however, these spectra are sensitive to the size of the measurement matrix, leading to biased insights. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm that provides unbiased estimates of the spectral moments of the kernel integral operator in the limit of infinite inputs and features from finitely sampled measurement matrices. Our method, based on dynamic programming, is efficient and capable of estimating the moments of the operator spectrum. We demonstrate the accuracy of our estimator on radial basis function (RBF) kernels, highlighting its consistency with the theoretical spectra. Furthermore, we showcase the practical utility and robustness of our method in understanding the geometry of learned representations in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Skills from Unlabeled Prior Data for Efficient Online Exploration</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised pretraining has been transformative in many supervised domains. However, applying such ideas to reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique challenge in that fine-tuning does not involve mimicking task-specific data, but rather exploring and locating the solution through iterative self-improvement. In this work, we study how unlabeled prior trajectory data can be leveraged to learn efficient exploration strategies. While prior data can be used to pretrain a set of low-level skills, or as additional off-policy data for online RL, it has been unclear how to combine these ideas effectively for online exploration. Our method SUPE (Skills from Unlabeled Prior data for Exploration) demonstrates that a careful combination of these ideas compounds their benefits. Our method first extracts low-level skills using a variational autoencoder (VAE), and then pseudo-relabels unlabeled trajectories using an optimistic reward model, transforming prior data into high-level, task-relevant examples. Finally, SUPE uses these transformed examples as additional off-policy data for online RL to learn a high-level policy that composes pretrained low-level skills to explore efficiently. We empirically show that SUPE reliably outperforms prior strategies, successfully solving a suite of long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Code: https://github.com/rail-berkeley/supe.</description>

Abstract: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, impulse responses, human faces) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to construct one's outcome under a counterfactual treatment, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its observed factual outcome on top of the covariates. We propose a deep variational Bayesian framework that rigorously integrates two main sources of information for outcome construction under a counterfactual treatment: one source is the individual features embedded in the high-dimensional factual outcome; the other source is the response distribution of similar subjects (subjects with the same covariates) that factually received this treatment of interest.</description>

      <title>ODBAE: a high-performance model identifying complex phenotypes in high-dimensional biological datasets</title>

Abstract: Identifying complex phenotypes from high-dimensional biological data is challenging due to the intricate interdependencies among different physiological indicators. Traditional approaches often focus on detecting outliers in single variables, overlooking the broader network of interactions that contribute to phenotype emergence. Here, we introduce ODBAE (Outlier Detection using Balanced Autoencoders), a machine learning method designed to uncover both subtle and extreme outliers by capturing latent relationships among multiple physiological parameters. ODBAE's revised loss function enhances its ability to detect two key types of outliers: influential points (IP), which disrupt latent correlations between dimensions, and high leverage points (HLP), which deviate from the norm but go undetected by traditional autoencoder-based methods. Using data from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), we show that ODBAE can identify knockout mice with complex, multi-indicator phenotypes - normal in individual traits, but abnormal when considered together. In addition, this method reveals novel metabolism-related genes and uncovers coordinated abnormalities across metabolic indicators. Our results highlight the utility of ODBAE in detecting joint abnormalities and advancing our understanding of homeostatic perturbations in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Utility Theory of Synthetic Data Generation</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data algorithms are widely employed in industries to generate artificial data for downstream learning tasks. While existing research primarily focuses on empirically evaluating utility of synthetic data, its theoretical understanding is largely lacking. This paper bridges the practice-theory gap by establishing relevant utility theory in a statistical learning framework. It considers two utility metrics: generalization and ranking of models trained on synthetic data. The former is defined as the generalization difference between models trained on synthetic and on real data. By deriving analytical bounds for this utility metric, we demonstrate that the synthetic feature distribution does not need to be similar as that of real data for ensuring comparable generalization of synthetic models, provided proper model specifications in downstream learning tasks. The latter utility metric studies the relative performance of models trained on synthetic data. In particular, we discover that the distribution of synthetic data is not necessarily similar as the real one to ensure consistent model comparison. Interestingly, consistent model comparison is still achievable even when synthetic responses are not well generated, as long as downstream models are separable by a generalization gap. Finally, extensive experiments on non-parametric models and deep neural networks have been conducted to validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Stable generative modeling using Schr\"odinger bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. Such settings have recently drawn considerable interest in the context of generative modelling and Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a generative model combining Schr\"odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. Schr\"odinger bridges over an appropriate reversible reference process are used to approximate the conditional transition probability from the available training samples, which is then implemented in a discrete-time reversible Langevin sampler to generate new samples. By setting the kernel bandwidth in the reference process to match the time step size used in the unadjusted Langevin algorithm, our method effectively circumvents any stability issues typically associated with the time-stepping of stiff stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a novel split-step scheme, ensuring that the generated samples remain within the convex hull of the training samples. Our framework can be naturally extended to generate conditional samples and to Bayesian inference problems. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing dimensions and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem as well as generating sample trajectories of a dynamical system using conditional sampling.</description>

      <title>Statistical Efficiency of Distributional Temporal Difference Learning</title>

Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved empirical success in various domains. One core task in the field of DRL is distributional policy evaluation, which involves estimating the return distribution $\eta^\pi$ for a given policy $\pi$. The distributional temporal difference learning has been accordingly proposed, which is an extension of the temporal difference learning (TD) in the classic RL area. In the tabular case, \citet{rowland2018analysis} and \citet{rowland2023analysis} proved the asymptotic convergence of two instances of distributional TD, namely categorical temporal difference learning (CTD) and quantile temporal difference learning (QTD), respectively. In this paper, we go a step further and analyze the finite-sample performance of distributional TD. To facilitate theoretical analysis, we propose non-parametric distributional TD learning (NTD). For a $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision process, we show that for NTD we need $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2p}(1-\gamma)^{2p+1}}\right)$ iterations to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal estimator with high probability, when the estimation error is measured by the $p$-Wasserstein distance. This sample complexity bound is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors in the case of the $1$-Wasserstein distance. To achieve this, we establish a novel Freedman's inequality in Hilbert spaces, which would be of independent interest. In addition, we revisit CTD, showing that the same non-asymptotic convergence bounds hold for CTD in the case of the $p$-Wasserstein distance for $p\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>LLM Processes: Numerical Predictive Distributions Conditioned on Natural Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12856v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning practitioners often face significant challenges in formally integrating their prior knowledge and beliefs into predictive models, limiting the potential for nuanced and context-aware analyses. Moreover, the expertise needed to integrate this prior knowledge into probabilistic modeling typically limits the application of these models to specialists. Our goal is to build a regression model that can process numerical data and make probabilistic predictions at arbitrary locations, guided by natural language text which describes a user's prior knowledge. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a useful starting point for designing such a tool since they 1) provide an interface where users can incorporate expert insights in natural language and 2) provide an opportunity for leveraging latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs that users may not have themselves. We start by exploring strategies for eliciting explicit, coherent numerical predictive distributions from LLMs. We examine these joint predictive distributions, which we call LLM Processes, over arbitrarily-many quantities in settings such as forecasting, multi-dimensional regression, black-box optimization, and image modeling. We investigate the practical details of prompting to elicit coherent predictive distributions, and demonstrate their effectiveness at regression. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to usefully incorporate text into numerical predictions, improving predictive performance and giving quantitative structure that reflects qualitative descriptions. This lets us begin to explore the rich, grounded hypothesis space that LLMs implicitly encode.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Infinite-Horizon Average-Reward Linear MDPs via Approximation by Discounted-Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning with linear MDPs. Previous approaches either suffer from computational inefficiency or require strong assumptions on dynamics, such as ergodicity, for achieving a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that achieves the regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ and is computationally efficient in the sense that the time complexity is polynomial in problem parameters. Our algorithm runs an optimistic value iteration on a discounted-reward MDP that approximates the average-reward setting. With an appropriately tuned discounting factor $\gamma$, the algorithm attains the desired $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. The challenge in our approximation approach is to get a regret bound with a sharp dependency on the effective horizon $1 / (1 - \gamma)$. We address this challenge by clipping the value function obtained at each value iteration step to limit the span of the value function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph encoder embedding, a recent technique for graph data, offers speed and scalability in producing vertex-level representations from binary graphs. In this paper, we extend the applicability of this method to a general graph model, which includes weighted graphs, distance matrices, and kernel matrices. We prove that the encoder embedding satisfies the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem on a per-observation basis. Under certain condition, it achieves asymptotic normality on a per-class basis, enabling optimal classification through discriminant analysis. These theoretical findings are validated through a series of experiments involving weighted graphs, as well as text and image data transformed into general graph representations using appropriate distance metrics.</description>

      <title>Stream-level flow matching from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data. Further, we advocate the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular the fact that the velocity of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training is preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the universal approximation property of single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks beyond the classical formulation over compact domains. More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we derive universal approximation results for neural networks within function spaces over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, e.g., weighted spaces, $L^p$-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains, where the latter includes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Furthermore, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for exploring generalization errors of transfer learning through the lens of differential calculus on the space of probability measures. In particular, we consider two main transfer learning scenarios, $\alpha$-ERM and fine-tuning with the KL-regularized empirical risk minimization and establish generic conditions under which the generalization error and the population risk convergence rates for these scenarios are studied. Based on our theoretical results, we show the benefits of transfer learning with a one-hidden-layer neural network in the mean-field regime under some suitable integrability and regularity assumptions on the loss and activation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langevin dynamics are widely used in sampling high-dimensional, non-Gaussian distributions whose densities are known up to a normalizing constant. In particular, there is strong interest in unadjusted Langevin algorithms (ULA), which directly discretize Langevin dynamics to estimate expectations over the target distribution. We study the use of transport maps that approximately normalize a target distribution as a way to precondition and accelerate the convergence of Langevin dynamics. We show that in continuous time, when a transport map is applied to Langevin dynamics, the result is a Riemannian manifold Langevin dynamics (RMLD) with metric defined by the transport map. We also show that applying a transport map to an irreversibly-perturbed ULA results in a geometry-informed irreversible perturbation (GiIrr) of the original dynamics. These connections suggest more systematic ways of learning metrics and perturbations, and also yield alternative discretizations of the RMLD described by the map, which we study. Under appropriate conditions, these discretized processes can be endowed with non-asymptotic bounds describing convergence to the target distribution in 2-Wasserstein distance. Illustrative numerical results complement our theoretical claims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05679v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised learning problems with side information in the form of a network arise frequently in applications in genomics, proteomics and neuroscience. For example, in genetic applications, the network side information can accurately capture background biological information on the intricate relations among the relevant genes. In this paper, we initiate a study of Bayes optimal learning in high-dimensional linear regression with network side information. To this end, we first introduce a simple generative model (called the Reg-Graph model) which posits a joint distribution for the supervised data and the observed network through a common set of latent parameters. Next, we introduce an iterative algorithm based on Approximate Message Passing (AMP) which is provably Bayes optimal under very general conditions. In addition, we characterize the limiting mutual information between the latent signal and the data observed, and thus precisely quantify the statistical impact of the network side information. Finally, supporting numerical experiments suggest that the introduced algorithm has excellent performance in finite samples.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling-based Online Learning for Episodic POMDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10107v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning in POMDPs is known to be significantly harder than in MDPs. In this paper, we consider the online learning problem for episodic POMDPs with unknown transition and observation models. We propose a Posterior Sampling-based reinforcement learning algorithm for POMDPs (PS4POMDPs), which is much simpler and more implementable compared to state-of-the-art optimism-based online learning algorithms for POMDPs. We show that the Bayesian regret of the proposed algorithm scales as the square root of the number of episodes and is polynomial in the other parameters. In a general setting, the regret scales exponentially in the horizon length $H$, and we show that this is inevitable by providing a lower bound. However, when the POMDP is undercomplete and weakly revealing (a common assumption in the recent literature), we establish a polynomial Bayesian regret bound. We finally propose a posterior sampling algorithm for multi-agent POMDPs, and show it too has sublinear regret.</description>

      <title>Coefficient Shape Alignment in Multiple Functional Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01925v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multivariate functional data analysis, different functional covariates often exhibit homogeneity. The covariates with pronounced homogeneity can be analyzed jointly within the same group, offering a parsimonious approach to modeling multivariate functional data. In this paper, a novel grouped multiple functional regression model with a new regularization approach termed {\it ``coefficient shape alignment"} is developed to tackle functional covariates homogeneity. The modeling procedure includes two steps: first aggregate covariates into disjoint groups using the new regularization approach; then the grouped multiple functional regression model is established based on the detected grouping structure. In this grouped model, the coefficient functions of covariates in the same group share the same shape, invariant to scaling. The new regularization approach works by penalizing differences in the shape of the coefficients. We establish conditions under which the true grouping structure can be accurately identified and derive the asymptotic properties of the model estimates. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed methods. The practical applicability of the model is demonstrated through real data analysis in the context of sugar quality evaluation. This work offers a novel framework for analyzing the homogeneity of functional covariates and constructing parsimonious models for multivariate functional data.</description>

      <title>A provable initialization and robust clustering method for general mixture models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool in statistical machine learning in the presence of heterogeneous data. Most recent results focus primarily on optimal mislabeling guarantees when data are distributed around centroids with sub-Gaussian errors. Yet, the restrictive sub-Gaussian model is often invalid in practice since various real-world applications exhibit heavy tail distributions around the centroids or suffer from possible adversarial attacks that call for robust clustering with a robust data-driven initialization. In this paper, we present initialization and subsequent clustering methods that provably guarantee near-optimal mislabeling for general mixture models when the number of clusters and data dimensions are finite. We first introduce a hybrid clustering technique with a novel multivariate trimmed mean type centroid estimate to produce mislabeling guarantees under a weak initialization condition for general error distributions around the centroids. A matching lower bound is derived, up to factors depending on the number of clusters. In addition, our approach also produces similar mislabeling guarantees even in the presence of adversarial outliers. Our results reduce to the sub-Gaussian case in finite dimensions when errors follow sub-Gaussian distributions. To solve the problem thoroughly, we also present novel data-driven robust initialization techniques and show that, with probabilities approaching one, these initial centroid estimates are sufficiently good for the subsequent clustering algorithm to achieve the optimal mislabeling rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Lloyd algorithm is suboptimal for more than two clusters even when errors are Gaussian and for two clusters when error distributions have heavy tails. Both simulated data and real data examples further support our robust initialization procedure and clustering algorithm.</description>

      <title>Do causal predictors generalize better to new domains?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how well machine learning models trained on causal features generalize across domains. We consider 16 prediction tasks on tabular datasets covering applications in health, employment, education, social benefits, and politics. Each dataset comes with multiple domains, allowing us to test how well a model trained in one domain performs in another. For each prediction task, we select features that have a causal influence on the target of prediction. Our goal is to test the hypothesis that models trained on causal features generalize better across domains. Without exception, we find that predictors using all available features, regardless of causality, have better in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy than predictors using causal features. Moreover, even the absolute drop in accuracy from one domain to the other is no better for causal predictors than for models that use all features. In addition, we show that recent causal machine learning methods for domain generalization do not perform better in our evaluation than standard predictors trained on the set of causal features. Likewise, causal discovery algorithms either fail to run or select causal variables that perform no better than our selection. Extensive robustness checks confirm that our findings are stable under variable misclassification.</description>

      <title>Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11960v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various failures, such as mechanical damages and Internet outages. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</description>

      <title>Empirical investigation of multi-source cross-validation in clinical ECG classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, machine learning-based clinical prediction models have been trained and evaluated on patient data from a single source, such as a hospital. Cross-validation methods can be used to estimate the accuracy of such models on new patients originating from the same source, by repeated random splitting of the data. However, such estimates tend to be highly overoptimistic when compared to accuracy obtained from deploying models to sources not represented in the dataset, such as a new hospital. The increasing availability of multi-source medical datasets provides new opportunities for obtaining more comprehensive and realistic evaluations of expected accuracy through source-level cross-validation designs.
  In this study, we present a systematic empirical evaluation of standard K-fold cross-validation and leave-source-out cross-validation methods in a multi-source setting. We consider the task of electrocardiogram based cardiovascular disease classification, combining and harmonizing the openly available PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2021 and the Shandong Provincial Hospital datasets for our study.
  Our results show that K-fold cross-validation, both on single-source and multi-source data, systemically overestimates prediction performance when the end goal is to generalize to new sources. Leave-source-out cross-validation provides more reliable performance estimates, having close to zero bias though larger variability. The evaluation highlights the dangers of obtaining misleading cross-validation results on medical data and demonstrates how these issues can be mitigated when having access to multi-source data.</description>

      <title>Acquiring Better Load Estimates by Combining Anomaly and Change Point Detection in Power Grid Time-series Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present novel methodology for automatic anomaly and switch event filtering to improve load estimation in power grid systems. By leveraging unsupervised methods with supervised optimization, our approach prioritizes interpretability while ensuring robust and generalizable performance on unseen data. Through experimentation, a combination of binary segmentation for change point detection and statistical process control for anomaly detection emerges as the most effective strategy, specifically when ensembled in a novel sequential manner. Results indicate the clear wasted potential when filtering is not applied. The automatic load estimation is also fairly accurate, with approximately 90% of estimates falling within a 10% error margin, with only a single significant failure in both the minimum and maximum load estimates across 60 measurements in the test set. Our methodology's interpretability makes it particularly suitable for critical infrastructure planning, thereby enhancing decision-making processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature-learning deep nets progressively collapse data to a regular low-dimensional geometry. How this phenomenon emerges from collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other choices that shape the dynamics, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively. We then propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram, explaining why some DNNs are lazy and some active, and linking feature learning across layers to generalization.</description>

      <title>UCB Exploration for Fixed-Budget Bayesian Best Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study best-arm identification (BAI) in the fixed-budget setting. Adaptive allocations based on upper confidence bounds (UCBs), such as UCBE, are known to work well in BAI. However, it is well-known that its optimal regret is theoretically dependent on instances, which we show to be an artifact in many fixed-budget BAI problems. In this paper we propose an UCB exploration algorithm that is both theoretically and empirically efficient for the fixed budget BAI problem under a Bayesian setting. The key idea is to learn prior information, which can enhance the performance of UCB-based BAI algorithm as it has done in the cumulative regret minimization problem. We establish bounds on the failure probability and the simple regret for the Bayesian BAI problem, providing upper bounds of order $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{K/n})$, up to logarithmic factors, where $n$ represents the budget and $K$ denotes the number of arms. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical results that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Reducing Variance in Meta-Learning via Laplace Approximation for Regression Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of sample points, meta-learning algorithms aim to learn an optimal adaptation strategy for new, unseen tasks. Often, this data can be ambiguous as it might belong to different tasks concurrently. This is particularly the case in meta-regression tasks. In such cases, the estimated adaptation strategy is subject to high variance due to the limited amount of support data for each task, which often leads to sub-optimal generalization performance. In this work, we address the problem of variance reduction in gradient-based meta-learning and formalize the class of problems prone to this, a condition we refer to as \emph{task overlap}. Specifically, we propose a novel approach that reduces the variance of the gradient estimate by weighing each support point individually by the variance of its posterior over the parameters. To estimate the posterior, we utilize the Laplace approximation, which allows us to express the variance in terms of the curvature of the loss landscape of our meta-learner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and highlight the importance of variance reduction in meta-learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is proposed to approximate potentially irregular functions in high dimension. We show that it outperforms multilayer perceptrons in terms of accuracy and converges faster. We also compare it with several proposed KAN networks: the original spline-based KAN network appears to be more effective for smooth functions, while the P1-KAN network is more effective for irregular functions.</description>

      <title>A Simple Baseline for Predicting Events with Auto-Regressive Tabular Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world applications of tabular data involve using historic events to predict properties of new ones, for example whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or what rating a customer will assign a product on a retail platform. Existing approaches to event prediction include costly, brittle, and application-dependent techniques such as time-aware positional embeddings, learned row and field encodings, and oversampling methods for addressing class imbalance. Moreover, these approaches often assume specific use-cases, for example that we know the labels of all historic events or that we only predict a pre-specified label and not the data's features themselves. In this work, we propose a simple but flexible baseline using standard autoregressive LLM-style transformers with elementary positional embeddings and a causal language modeling objective. Our baseline outperforms existing approaches across popular datasets and can be employed for various use-cases. We demonstrate that the same model can predict labels, impute missing values, or model event sequences.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</description>
