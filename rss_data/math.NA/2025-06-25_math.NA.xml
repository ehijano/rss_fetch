      <title>A Hybrid High-Order Method for the Gross--Pitaevskii Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid high-order method for approximating the ground state of the nonlinear Gross--Pitaevskii eigenvalue problem. Optimal convergence rates are proved for the ground state approximation, as well as for the associated eigenvalue and energy approximations. Unlike classical conforming methods, which inherently provide upper bounds on the ground state energy, the proposed approach gives rise to guaranteed and asymptotically exact lower energy bounds. Importantly, and in contrast to previous works, they are obtained directly without the need of post-processing, leading to more accurate guaranteed lower energy bounds in practice.</description>

      <title>A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</description>

      <title>DefElement: an encyclopedia of finite element definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DefElement is an online encyclopedia of finite element definitions that was created and is maintained by the authors of this paper. DefElement aims to make information about elements defined in the literature easily available in a standard format. There are a number of open-source finite element libraries available, and it can be difficult to check that an implementation of an element in a library matches the element's definition in the literature or implementation in another library, especially when many libraries include variants of elements whose basis functions do not match exactly. In this paper, we carefully derive conditions under which elements can be considered equivalent and describe an algorithm that uses these conditions to verify that two implementations of a finite element are indeed variants of the same element. The results of scheduled runs of our implementation of this verification algorithm are included in the information available on DefElement.</description>

      <title>A quasi-Grassmannian gradient flow model for eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quasi-Grassmannian gradient flow model for eigenvalue problems of linear operators, aiming to efficiently address many eigenpairs. Our model inherently ensures asymptotic orthogonality: without the need for initial orthogonality, the solution naturally evolves toward being orthogonal over time. We establish the well-posedness of the model, and provide the analytical representation of solutions. Through asymptotic analysis, we show that the gradient converges exponentially to zero and that the energy decreases exponentially to its minimum. This implies that the solution of the quasi-Grassmannian gradient flow model converges to the solution of the eigenvalue problems as time progresses. These properties not only eliminate the need for explicit orthogonalization in numerical computation but also significantly enhance robustness of the model, rendering it far more resilient to numerical perturbations than conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic particle method with birth-death dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to numerically solve high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs and alleviate the curse of dimensionality, a stochastic particle method (SPM) has been proposed to capture the relevant feature of the solution through the adaptive evolution of particles [J. Comput. Phys. 527 (2025) 113818]. In this paper, we introduce an active birth-death dynamics of particles to improve the efficiency of SPM. The resulting method, dubbed SPM-birth-death, sample new particles according to the nonlinear term and execute the annihilation strategy when the number of particles exceeds a given threshold. Preliminary numerical experiments on the Allen-Cahn equation demonstrate that SPM-birth-death can achieve smaller errors at the same computational cost compared with the original SPM.</description>

      <title>Low-order finite element complex with application to a fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-order nonconforming finite element discretization of a smooth de Rham complex starting from the $H^2$ space in three dimensions is proposed, involving an $H^2$-nonconforming finite element space, a new tangentially continuous $H^1$-nonconforming vector-valued finite element space, the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas space, and piecewise constant functions. While nonconforming for the smooth complex, the discretization conforms to the classical de Rham complex. It is applied to develop a decoupled mixed finite element method for a fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem, focusing on the discretization of a generalized singularly perturbed Stokes-type equation. In contrast to Nitsche's method, which requires additional stabilization to handle boundary layers, the nodal interpolation operator for the lowest-order N\'{e}d\'{e}lec element of the second kind is introduced into the discrete bilinear forms. This modification yields a decoupled mixed method that achieves optimal convergence rates uniformly with respect to the perturbation parameter, even in the presence of strong boundary layers, without requiring any additional stabilization.</description>

      <title>Deep random difference method for high dimensional quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with deep learning methods is often computationally and memory intensive, primarily due to the need for automatic differentiation (AD) to compute large Hessian matrices in the PDE. In this work, we propose a deep random difference method (DRDM) that addresses these issues by approximating the convection-diffusion operator using only first-order differences and the solution by deep neural networks, thus, avoiding explicit Hessian computation. When incorporated into a Galerkin framework, the DRDM eliminates the need for pointwise evaluation of expectations, resulting in efficient implementation. We further extend the approach to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Notably, the DRDM recovers existing martingale deep learning methods for PDEs (Cai et al., 2024, arXiv:2405.03169), without using the tools of stochastic calculus. The proposed method offers two main advantages: it removes the dependence on AD for PDE derivatives and enables parallel computation of the loss function in both time and space. We provide rigorous error estimates for the DRDM in the linear case, which shows a first order accuracy in $\Delta t$ used in the sampling of the paths by the Euler-Maruyama scheme. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method can efficiently and accurately solve quasilinear parabolic PDEs and HJB equations in dimensions up to $10^4$ and $10^5$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Solver Performance of Accelerated MoM for Connected Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating and developing large rectangularly shaped arrays with equidistant interspacing is challenging as the computational complexity grows quickly with array size. However, the geometrical shape of the array, appropriately meshed, leads to a multilevel Toeplitz structure in the RWG-based Method of Moment impedance matrix representation that can be used to mitigate the increased complexity. This paper develops, presents and compares two different accelerated solvers that both utilize the matrix structure to determine antenna properties. Both methods use a novel mesh-partitioning algorithm and its associated data representation, reducing storage and computational costs. The first solver is an iterative method based on multilevel fast Fourier transform to accelerate matrix multiplications. The second solver approach is based on an extension of a fast direct Toeplitz solver, adapted to a block-matrix structure. This fast direct solver is demonstrated to have close to machine epsilon accuracy. Both accelerated methods are evaluated on two different array element types, for arrays with up to 900 elements. The results are compared with conventional direct and iterative matrix solvers. Improvements are seen in both the time and required storage to solve the problem. The choice of the most efficient method depends on the residual thresholds in the iterative method, geometry of the element and frequency. Two different preconditioners for the iterative method are investigated to evaluate their performance. The two accelerated methods vastly outperform regular matrix inversion methods.</description>

      <title>An adaptive scheme for the optimization of damping positions by decoupling controllability spaces in vibrational systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the problem of optimizing damper positions in vibrational systems is investigated. The objective is to determine the positions of external dampers in such a way that the influence of the input on the output is minimized. The energy response serves as an optimization criterion, whose computation involves solving Lyapunov equations. Hence, in order to find the best positions, many of these equations need to be solved, and so the minimization process can have a high computational cost.
  To accelerate the process of finding the optimal positions, we propose a new reduction method. Our algorithm generates a basis spanning an approximation to the solution space of the Lyapunov equations for all possible positions of the dampers. We derive an adaptive scheme that generates the reduced solution space by adding the subspaces of interest, and then we define the corresponding reduced optimization problem that is solvable in a reasonable amount of time. We decouple the solution spaces of the problem to obtain a space that corresponds to the system without external dampers and serves as a starting point for the reduction of the optimization problem. In addition, we derive spaces corresponding to the different damper positions that are used to expand the reduced basis if needed. To evaluate the quality of the basis, we introduce an error indicator based on the space decomposition. Our new technique produces a reduced optimization problem of significantly smaller dimension that is faster to solve than the original problem, which we illustrate with some numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Taylor-Hood finite element method for the surface Stokes problem without penalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element approximation of the velocity-pressure formulation of the surfaces Stokes equations is challenging because it is typically not possible to enforce both tangentiality and $H^1$ conformity of the velocity field. Most previous works concerning finite element methods (FEMs) for these equations thus have weakly enforced one of these two constraints by penalization or a Lagrange multiplier formulation. Recently in [A tangential and penalty-free finite element method for the surface Stokes problem, SINUM 62(1):248-272, 2024], the authors constructed a surface Stokes FEM based on the MINI element which is tangentiality conforming and $H^1$ nonconforming, but possesses sufficient weak continuity properties to circumvent the need for penalization. The key to this method is construction of velocity degrees of freedom lying on element edges and vertices using an auxiliary Piola transform. In this work we extend this methodology to construct Taylor-Hood surface FEMs. The resulting method is shown to achieve optimal-order convergence when the edge degrees of freedom for the velocity spaced are placed at Gauss-Lobatto nodes. Numerical experiments confirm that this nonstandard placement of nodes is necessary to achieve optimal convergence orders.</description>

      <title>A Novel Homotopy Perturbation Sumudu Transform Method for Nonlinear Fractional PDEs: Applications and Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the Homotopy Perturbation Sumudu Transform Method (HPSTM), a novel hybrid approach combining the Sumudu transform with homotopy perturbation to solve nonlinear fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs), including fractional porous medium, heat transfer, and Fisher equations, using the Caputo fractional derivative. HPSTM leverages the linearity-preserving properties of the Sumudu transform and the flexibility of homotopy perturbation, achieving faster convergence than Laplace-HPM or Elzaki-HPM for strongly nonlinear FPDEs. Series solutions yield absolute errors as low as $3.12 \times 10^{-3}$ for $\alpha = 0.9$, with computational times averaging 0.5 seconds per example using 5 series terms on standard hardware. Solutions are validated against exact solutions, Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM), radial basis function (RBF) meshless method, Variational Iteration Method (VIM), Finite Difference Method (FDM), and a spectral method. Numerical examples, sensitivity analysis, and graphical representations for $\alpha = 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7$ confirm HPSTM's accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Limitations include challenges with high-order nonlinearities and multi-dimensional domains. HPSTM shows promise for applications in modeling fluid flow in porous media, heat conduction in complex materials, and biological population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Causal Operator Discovery in Partial Differential Equations via Counterfactual Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a principled framework for discovering causal structure in partial differential equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks and counterfactual perturbations. Unlike classical residual minimization or sparse regression methods, our approach quantifies operator-level necessity through functional interventions on the governing dynamics. We introduce causal sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics to assess the influence of candidate differential operators within neural surrogates. Theoretically, we prove exact recovery of the causal operator support under restricted isometry or mutual coherence conditions, with residual bounds guaranteeing identifiability. Empirically, we validate the framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets across climate dynamics, tumor diffusion, and ocean flows. Our method consistently recovers governing operators even under noise, redundancy, and data scarcity, outperforming standard PINNs and DeepONets in structural fidelity. This work positions causal PDE discovery as a tractable and interpretable inference task grounded in structural causal models and variational residual analysis.</description>

      <title>Fast entropy-regularized SDP relaxations for permutation synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce fast randomized algorithms for solving semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of the partial permutation synchronization (PPS) problem, a core task in multi-image matching with significant relevance to 3D reconstruction. Our methods build on recent advances in entropy-regularized semidefinite programming and are tailored to the unique structure of PPS, in which the unknowns are partial permutation matrices aligning sparse and noisy pairwise correspondences across images. We prove that entropy regularization resolves optimizer non-uniqueness in standard relaxations, and we develop a randomized solver with nearly optimal scaling in the number of observed correspondences. We also develop several rounding procedures for recovering combinatorial solutions from the implicitly represented primal solution variable, maintaining cycle consistency if desired without harming computational scaling. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets in terms of speed and accuracy. Our results highlight PPS as a paradigmatic setting in which entropy-regularized SDP admits both theoretical and practical advantages over traditional low-rank or spectral techniques.</description>

      <title>Pivot probabilities and norm effects in Gaussian elimination for $\beta$-ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze pivot probabilities in Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) for $2 \times 2$ random matrix ensembles. For GUE matrices, we resolve a previously reported discrepancy between theoretical predictions and empirical observations by deriving the exact pivot probability under standard LAPACK-style implementations. We further show that Dumitriu-Edelman tridiagonal $\beta$-ensembles agree with the earlier theoretical expectations. Finally, we propose an open question on pivot behavior under alternative norm choices, supported by empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>AI Assistants to Enhance and Exploit the PETSc Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended. PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists, GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>First-order methods for stochastic and finite-sum convex optimization with deterministic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of stochastic and finite-sum convex optimization problems with deterministic constraints. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-$expectedly\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$ solution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality gap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty, rendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial violations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods for finding an $\epsilon$-$surely\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$ ($\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically bounded by $\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\epsilon$. Our methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified variance-reduced ASG scheme $only\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty subproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish first-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an $\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle complexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an $\epsilon$-SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our proposed methods to solve the sample average problem.</description>

      <title>A Parallelizable Quaternion Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05211v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is a celebrated tool for tensor data analysis. The sequential HOSVD was recently generalized to the quaternion domain, while a naive quaternion extension of the classical HOSVD% by De Lathauwer et al., which can be excecuted in parallel, incurs issues. To leverage the power of parallel computing, this work introduces a two-sided quaternion HOSVD (TS-QHOSVD) that can be parallelized on two processors. It is proved that TS-QHOSVD (i) preserves the HOSVD ordering property, (ii) inherits the orthogonality property at the first and the last modes, and (iii) satisfies the weak orthogonality at all modes. The truncated TS-QHOSVD is then developed, with its error bound being established. We apply the proposed model on color video denoising as well as scientific data compression arising from 3D Navier-Stokes equation and Lorentz system to demonstrate its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Efficient high-resolution refinement in cryo-EM with stochastic gradient descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) is an imaging technique widely used in structural biology to determine the three-dimensional structure of biological molecules from noisy two-dimensional projections with unknown orientations. As the typical pipeline involves processing large amounts of data, efficient algorithms are crucial for fast and reliable results. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been used to improve the speed of ab initio reconstruction, which results in a first, low-resolution estimation of the volume representing the molecule of interest, but has yet to be applied successfully in the high-resolution regime, where expectation-maximization algorithms achieve state-of-the-art results, at a high computational cost. In this article, we investigate the conditioning of the optimization problem and show that the large condition number prevents the successful application of gradient descent-based methods at high resolution. Our results include a theoretical analysis of the condition number of the optimization problem in a simplified setting where the individual projection directions are known, an algorithm based on computing a diagonal preconditioner using Hutchinson's diagonal estimator, and numerical experiments showing the improvement in the convergence speed when using the estimated preconditioner with SGD. The preconditioned SGD approach can potentially enable a simple and unified approach to ab initio reconstruction and high-resolution refinement with faster convergence speed and higher flexibility, and our results are a promising step in this direction.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for elastic wave from Partial Cauchy Data: Uniqueness and Co-inversion for Shape and Impedance Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem for the elastic wave of simultaneously reconstructing the impedance and the geometric information of the bounded body that is occupied by a homogeneous and isotropic elastic medium from the measured Cauchy data. A two-stage reconstruction method is proposed to realize simultaneous reconstruction of multiple targets. In the first step, we restore the aperture information by utilizing the observed Cauchy data that is measured on an accessible part of the boundary. In the second step, we start with the boundary condition and propose a novel iterative method to simultaneously reconstruct the missing boundary and the impedance function. Theoretically, we establish the uniqueness result of the co-inversion problem based on analyzing the properties of the corresponding operators. An explicit derivative is computed for the iterative method. Numerical examples are presented to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Theory for Runge-Kutta-like Time Integrators: Convergence and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work deals with two major topics concerning the numerical analysis of Runge-Kutta-like (RK-like) methods, namely their stability and order of convergence. RK-like methods differ from additive RK methods in that their coefficients are allowed to depend on the solution and the step size. As a result of this, we also refer to them as non-standard additive RK (NSARK) methods. The first major part of this thesis is dedicated to providing a tool for deriving order conditions for NSARK methods. The proposed approach may yield implicit order conditions, which can be rewritten in explicit form using the NB-series of the stages. The obtained explicit order conditions can be further reduced using Gr\"obner bases computations. With the presented approach, it was possible for the first time to obtain conditions for the construction of 3rd and 4th order GeCo as well as 4th order MPRK schemes. Moreover, a new fourth order MPRK method is constructed using our theory and the order of convergence is validated numerically. The second major part is concerned with the stability of nonlinear time integrators preserving at least one linear invariant. We discuss how the given approach generalizes the notion of A-stability. We can prove that investigating the Jacobian of the generating map is sufficient to understand the stability of the nonlinear method in a neighborhood of the steady state. This approach allows for the first time the investigation of several modified Patankar. In the case of MPRK schemes, we compute a general stability function in a way that can be easily adapted to the case of PDRS. Finally, the approach from the theory of dynamical systems is used to derive a necessary condition for avoiding unrealistic oscillations of the numerical approximation.</description>

      <title>A conservative Eulerian finite element method for transport and diffusion in moving domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper introduces a finite element method for an Eulerian formulation of partial differential equations governing the transport and diffusion of a scalar quantity in a time-dependent domain. The method follows the idea from Lehrenfeld &amp; Olshanskii [ESAIM: M2AN, 53(2): 585-614, 2019] of a solution extension to realise the Eulerian time-stepping scheme. However, a reformulation of the partial differential equation is suggested to derive a scheme which conserves the quantity under consideration exactly on the discrete level. For the spatial discretisation, the paper considers an unfitted finite element method. Ghost-penalty stabilisation is used to realise the discrete solution extension and gives a scheme robust against arbitrary intersections between the mesh and geometry interface. The stability is analysed for both first- and second-order backward differentiation formula versions of the scheme. Several numerical examples in two and three spatial dimensions are included to illustrate the potential of this method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for numerical approximation of a new class of fractional parabolic stochastic evolution equations is introduced and analysed. This class of equations has recently been proposed as a space-time extension of the SPDE-method in spatial statistics. A truncation of the spectral basis function expansion is used to discretise in space, and then a quadrature is used to approximate the temporal evolution of each basis coefficient. Strong error bounds are proved both for the spectral and temporal approximations. The method is tested and the results are verified by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Exponential quadrature rules for problems with time-dependent fractional source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose newly-derived exponential quadrature rules for stiff linear differential equations with time-dependent fractional sources in the form $h(t^r)$, with $0&lt;r&lt;1$ and $h$ a sufficiently smooth function. To construct the methods, the source term is interpolated at $\nu$ collocation points by a suitable non-polynomial function, yielding to time marching schemes that we call Exponential Quadrature Rules for Fractional sources (EQRF$\nu$). The error analysis is done in the framework of strongly continuous semigroups. Compared to classical exponential quadrature rules, which in our case of interest converge with order $1+r$ at most, we prove that the new methods may reach order $1+\nu r$ for proper choices of the collocation points. We also show that the proposed integrators can be written in terms of special instances of the Mittag--Leffler functions that we call fractional $\varphi$ functions. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the theoretical findings and highlight the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Riemann problem is fundamental in the computational modeling of hyperbolic partial differential equations, enabling the development of stable and accurate upwind schemes. While exact solvers provide robust upwinding fluxes, their high computational cost necessitates approximate solvers. Although approximate solvers achieve accuracy in many scenarios, they produce inaccurate solutions in certain cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose constructing neural network-based surrogate models, trained using supervised learning, designed to map interior and exterior conservative state variables to the corresponding exact flux. Specifically, we propose two distinct approaches: one utilizing a vanilla neural network and the other employing a bi-fidelity neural network. The performance of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through applications to one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations, showcasing their robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fast LDL factorization for dense and sparse symmetric matrices over an arbitrary field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While existing algorithms may be used to solve a linear system over a general field in matrix-multiplication time, the complexity of constructing a symmetric triangular factorization (LDL) has received relatively little formal study. The LDL factorization is a common tool for factorization of symmetric matrices, and, unlike orthogonal counterparts, generalizes to an arbitrary field. We provide algorithms for dense and sparse LDL and LU factorization that aim to minimize complexity for factorization over a general field. For LDL of an $n\times n$ matrix, we give an algorithm with complexity $O(n^\omega)$, where the complexity of $n\times n$ matrix multiplication is assumed to be $O(n^\omega)$ with $\omega&gt;2$. For sparse matrices corresponding to graphs with treewidth $\tau$, we give an algorithm with complexity $O(n\tau^{\omega-1})$, to compute an LDL an implicit form, or the explicit LDL if the matrix is near full rank. Our sparse LDL algorithm is based on an adaptation of the null-space method for solving saddle point systems of equations, which may be of independent interest. The sparse LDL factorization algorithm also extends to computing a sparse LU factorization.</description>

      <title>Minimal Subsampled Rank-1 Lattices for Multivariate Approximation with Optimal Convergence Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show error bounds for randomly subsampled rank-1 lattices. We pay particular attention to the ratio of the size of the subset to the size of the initial lattice, which is decisive for the computational complexity. In the special case of Korobov spaces, we achieve the optimal polynomial sampling complexity whilst having the smallest initial lattice possible. We further characterize the frequency index set for which a given lattice is reconstructing by using the reciprocal of the worst-case error achieved using the lattice in question. This connects existing approaches used in proving error bounds for lattices. We make detailed comments on the implementation and test different algorithms using the subsampled lattice in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this through a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations, along with a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based minimization of the Ginzburg-Landau functional on Euclidean spaces and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the momentum-based minimization of a diffuse perimeter functional on Euclidean spaces and on graphs with applications to semi-supervised classification tasks in machine learning. While the gradient flow in the task at hand is a parabolic partial differential equation, the momentum method corresponds to a damped hyperbolic PDE, leading to qualitatively and quantitatively different trajectories. Using a convex-concave splitting-based FISTA-type time discretization, we demonstrate empirically that momentum can lead to faster convergence if the time step size is large but not too large. With large time steps, the PDE analysis offers only limited insight into the geometric behavior of solutions and typical hyperbolic phenomena like loss of regularity are not be observed in sample simulations. We obtain the singular limit of the evolution equations as the length parameter of the phase fields tends to zero by formal expansions and numerically confirm its validity for circles in two dimensions. Our analysis is complemented by numerical experiments for planar curves, surfaces in three-dimensional space, and semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Free Sequential Bayesian Experimental Design via Interacting Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) in sequential settings, aimed at complex systems where gradient information is unavailable. Our method combines Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) for design optimization with the Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI) sampler for efficient posterior sampling-both of which are derivative-free and ensemble-based. To address the computational challenges posed by nested expectations in BOED, we propose variational Gaussian and parametrized Laplace approximations that provide tractable upper and lower bounds on the Expected Information Gain (EIG). These approximations enable scalable utility estimation in high-dimensional spaces and PDE-constrained inverse problems. We demonstrate the performance of our framework through numerical experiments ranging from linear Gaussian models to PDE-based inference tasks, highlighting the method's robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in information-driven experimental design.</description>
