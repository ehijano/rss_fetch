      <title>Optomechanically induced transparency, absorption, and conversion between slow and fast light in a generalized cross-Kerr optomechanical circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and explore an experimentally viable scheme to realize tunable optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) and optomechanically induced absorption (OMIA) phenomena in a hybrid microwave-optomechanical circuit in which two single-Cooper-pair transistors (SCPTs) are coupled to a common microwave $LC$ resonator and two independent micromechanical resonators. We show that under special conditions such a system can be equivalently modeled as a two-mechanical-modes optomechanical cavity in which, besides the standard radiation-pressure coupling, the cavity mode interacts with the mechanical modes through the cross-Kerr (CK), a higher-order generalized CK, and a three-mode CK type of coupling. Furthermore, there is an induced CK coupling between the two-mechanical modes. Assuming that the cavity mode is simultaneously driven by a strong control field and a weak probe field, we analyze the response of the output probe field affected by the above-mentioned nonlinear couplings. In particular, our results reveal that the higher-order nonlinear CK and the three-mode CK couplings have remarkable impact on the characteristics of the OMIT and OMIA phenomena. Moreover, we find that these nonlinear couplings can give rise to the occurrence of the gain in the absorption profile and contribute to the amplification of the output probe field in specific frequency regions. We also show that the system offers tunable switching between slow and fast light behaviors. The proposed hybrid optomechanical circuit may find potential applications in light propagation, quantum sensing of physical quantities, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Intersubjective Agreement about Quantum States Is Unnecessary in QBism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thought experiment called Wigner's Friend has experienced a renewal of interest for interrogating the meaning of intersubjectivity and objectivity in quantum mechanics. These new inquiries extend to investigations at the intersection of phenomenology and QBism. Philosopher of physics Steven French has criticized QBism on the grounds that it does not give assurances that Wigner and friend must agree on the same quantum state or the same set of facts in the experiment. In this paper, we draw on Wigner's Friend to argue that intersubjective agreement on quantum states is unnecessary. We defend the QBist notion of reciprocity, treating Wigner and friend as "peer observers" or physical systems taking mutual actions on each other. We argue that accounts of intersubjectivity that preserve the possibility of privileged observation, vantage points for solipsistic super-observers, undermine the epistemic benefits we look for when we insist on intersubjectivity agreement as a criterion for objectivity. In its place, the QBist notion of reciprocity leads to sharper characterization of what it means to objectify quantum systems with a quantum state assignment. Drawing on phenomenological resources, we argue that state assignments for quantum systems, including those for Wigner and friend, are thematizations. To assign a quantum state is to thematize a phenomenon as a quantum system, to treat something as the sort of object to which the formalism applies. Our argument accounts for why the quantum formalism does not radically change in application for different systems because the systems themselves exceed their formalization.</description>

      <title>From Rotations to Unitaries: Reversible Quantum Processes and the Emergence of the $SU(2)-SO(3)$ Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an operational reconstruction of the well-known (quasi-)isomorphism between the groups $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$, grounded in the physical description of quantum state preparation and evolution. Starting from the connection between vectors in three-dimensional physical space and quantum states of two-level systems, we investigate how reversible transformations - modeled as CPTP maps - give rise to a correspondence between spatial rotations and unitary operations. Our approach reveals how this group-theoretic structure naturally emerges from physical constraints, particularly the preservation of purity and reversibility in quantum processes. Beyond its theoretical relevance, the construction offers a pedagogically accessible framework for introducing core ideas in quantum mechanics and symmetry groups, making the abstract correspondence between $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ tangible through experimentally meaningful procedures.</description>

      <title>Random-projector quantum diagnostics of Ramsey numbers and a prime-factor heuristic for $R(5,5)=45$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a statistical framework for estimating Ramsey numbers by embedding two-color Ramsey instances into a $Z_2 \times Z_2$-graded Majorana algebra. This approach replaces brute-force enumeration with two randomized spectral diagnostics applied to operators of a given dimension d associated with Ramsey numbers: a linear projector $P_{lin}$ and an exponential map $P_{exp}(\alpha)$, suitable for both classical and quantum computation. In the diagonal case, both diagnostics identify R(5,5) at n=45. The quantum realizations act on a reduced module and therefore require only five data qubits plus a few ancillas via block-encoding/qubitization for R(5,5)=45, in stark contrast to the $\binom{n}{2} \approx 10^3$ logical qubits demanded by direct edge encodings. We also provide few-qubit estimates for R(6,6) and R(7,7), and propose a simple "prime-sequence" consistency heuristic that connects R(5,5)=45 to constrained diagonal growth. Our method echoes Erd\H{o}s's probabilistic paradigm, emphasizing randomized arguments rather than explicit colorings, and parallels the classical coin-flip approach to Ramsey bounds. Finally, we discuss potential applications of this framework to machine learning with a limited number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Fullqubit alchemist: Quantum algorithm for alchemical free energy calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately computing the free energies of biological processes is a cornerstone of computer-aided drug design but it is a daunting task. The need to sample vast conformational spaces and account for entropic contributions makes the estimation of binding free energies very expensive. While classical methods, such as thermodynamic integration and alchemical free energy calculations, have significantly contributed to reducing computational costs, they still face limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability. We tackle this through a quantum algorithm for the estimation of free energy differences by adapting the existing Liouvillian approach and introducing several key algorithmic improvements. We directly implement the Liouvillian operator and provide an efficient description of electronic forces acting on both nuclear and electronic particles on the quantum ground state potential energy surface. This leads to super-polynomial runtime scaling improvements in the precision of our Liouvillian simulation approach and quadratic improvements in the scaling with the number of particles. Second, our algorithm calculates free energy differences via a fully quantum implementation of thermodynamic integration and alchemy, thereby foregoing expensive entropy estimation subroutines used in prior works. Our results open new avenues towards the application of quantum computers in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Simulation for Advection-Diffusion Equation with arbitrary transport field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to solve the advection-diffusion equation under arbitrary transporting fields using a quantum-inspired 'Schrodingerisation' technique for Hamiltonian simulation. Although numerous methods exist for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), Hamiltonian simulation remains a relatively underexplored yet promising direction-particularly in the context of long-term, fault-tolerant quantum computing. Building on this potential, our quantum algorithm is designed to accommodate non-trivial, spatially varying transport fields and is applicable to both 2D and 3D advection-diffusion problems. To ensure numerical stability and accuracy, the algorithm combines an upwinding discretization scheme for the advective component and the central differencing for diffusion, adapted for quantum implementation through a tailored mix of approximation and optimization techniques. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on benchmark scenarios involving coupled rotational, shear, and diffusive transport in two and three dimensions. Additionally, we implement the 2D advection-diffusion equation using 16 qubits on IBM Quantum hardware, validating our method and highlighting its practical applicability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning holds promise for advancing time series forecasting. The Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN), inspired by classical RNNs, encodes temporal data into quantum states that are periodically input into a quantum circuit. While prior QRNN work has predominantly used angle encoding, alternative encoding strategies like amplitude encoding remain underexplored due to their high computational complexity. In this paper, we evaluate and improve amplitude-based QRNNs using EnQode, a recently introduced method for approximate amplitude encoding. We propose a simple pre-processing technique that augments amplitude encoded inputs with their pre-normalized magnitudes, leading to improved generalization on two real world data sets. Additionally, we introduce a novel circuit architecture for the QRNN that is mathematically equivalent to the original model but achieves a substantial reduction in circuit depth. Together, these contributions demonstrate practical improvements to QRNN design in both model performance and quantum resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a defining property of quantum systems. For a subsystem of a larger quantum system, one can formally define an operator known as the modular Hamiltonian, which is closely linked to the entanglement properties of that subsystem, and a corresponding operator flow called the modular flow. Algorithms for estimating the von Neumann entropy, the best-known entanglement measure, are well-established, but no equivalent procedures have been previously described for the modular flow. In this work, we briefly review the quantum singular value transform (QSVT) framework for developing quantum algorithms, and then discuss the implementation of modular flow within this framework. We conclude by describing select applications of our modular flow algorithm, such as extracting the chiral central charge of a topologically ordered system and simulating the experience of the bulk observer in holography. We also prove a query complexity lower bound for modular flow, which shows that our method cannot be improved further substantially.</description>

      <title>Optimized quantum algorithms for simulating the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwinger model, which describes lattice quantum electrodynamics in $1+1$ space-time dimensions, provides a valuable framework to investigate fundamental aspects of quantum field theory, and a stepping stone towards non-Abelian gauge theories. Specifically, it enables the study of physically relevant dynamical processes, such as the nonperturbative particle-antiparticle pairs production, known as the Schwinger effect. In this work, we analyze the quantum computational resource requirements associated with simulating the Schwinger effect under two distinct scenarios: (1) a quench process, where the initial state is a simple product state of a non-interacting theory, and interactions are turned on at time $t=0$; (2) a splitting (or scattering) process where two Gaussian states, peaked at given initial momenta, are shot away from (or towards) each other. We explore different physical regimes in which the Schwinger effect is expected to be observable. These regimes are characterized by initial momenta and coupling strengths, as well as simulation parameters such as lattice size and electric-field cutoffs. Leveraging known rigorous bounds for electric-field cutoffs, we find that a reliable simulation of the Schwinger effect is provably possible at high cutoff scales. Furthermore, we provide optimized circuit implementations of both the second-order Trotter formula and an interaction-picture algorithm based on the Dyson series to implement the time evolution. Our detailed resource estimates show the regimes in which the interaction-picture approach outperforms the Trotter approach, and vice versa. The improved theoretical error bounds, optimized quantum circuit designs, and explicitly compiled subroutines developed in this study are broadly applicable to simulations of other lattice models in high-energy physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Unitary network: Tensor network unitaries with local unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce unitary network, an oriented architecture for tensor network unitaries. Compared to existing architectures, in a unitary network each local tensor is required to be a unitary matrix upon suitable reshaping. Global unitarity is ensured when the network obeys a suitable ordering property. Unitary operators represented by unitary networks need not preserve locality. In particular, we show that the class of unitary networks encompasses global unitaries which preserve locality up to exponentially suppressed tails, as in those that naturally arise from the finite-time evolution of local Hamiltonians. Non-invertible symmetries, as exemplified by the non-local Kramers-Wannier duality in one dimension, can also be represented using unitary networks. We also show that information flow in a unitary network can be characterized by a flow index, which matches the known index for quantum cellular automata as a special case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroscientists face challenges in analyzing high-dimensional neural recording data of dense functional networks. Without ground-truth reference data, finding the best algorithm for recovering neurologically relevant networks remains an open question. We implemented hybrid quantum algorithms to construct functional networks and compared them with the results of documented classical techniques. We demonstrated that our quantum state fidelity can provide a competitive alternative to classical metrics by revealing distinct functional networks. Our results suggest that quantum computing offers a viable and potentially advantageous alternative for data-driven modeling in neuroscience, underscoring its broader applicability in high-dimensional graph inference and complex system analysis.</description>

      <title>Tunable Superconducting Quantum Interference Device Coupler for Fluxonium Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable couplers enable high-fidelity two-qubit gates leveraging high on/off coupling ratios and reduced crosstalk within a single design. We investigate a galvanically connected direct-current superconducting quantum interference device (dc SQUID) as a minimal tunable coupling element for fluxonium qubits. Comparing grounded and floating fluxonium designs, we find that the latter contains an extra sloshing mode that strongly hybridizes with the qubit modes, leading to significant static ZZ crosstalk. In contrast, the grounded design avoids this issue and allows suppression of static ZZ crosstalk using a shunting capacitor. Leveraging fast flux control, we present two schemes to implement two-qubit gates, predicting a $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$-like gate with $99.9\%$ open-system fidelity in less than 6 nanoseconds assuming modest relaxation and dephasing rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Lindblad equation governs the non-unitary time evolution of density operators used in the description of open quantum systems. It is usually derived from the von Neumann equation for a large system, at given physical conditions, when a small subsystem is explicitly singled out and the rest of the system acts as an environment whose degrees of freedom are traced out. In the specific case of a subsystem with variable particle number, the equilibrium density operator is given by the well-known grand canonical Gibbs state. Consequently, solving the Lindblad equation in this case should automatically yield, without any additional assumptions, the corresponding density operator in the limiting case of statistical equilibrium. Current studies of the Lindblad equation with varying particle number assume, however, the grand canonical Gibbs state a priori: the chemical potential is externally imposed rather than derived from first principles, and hence the corresponding density operator is not obtained as a natural solution of the equation. In this work, we investigate the compatibility of grand canonical statistical mechanics with the derivation of the Lindblad equation. We propose an alternative and complementary approach to the current literature that consists in using a generalized system Hamiltonian which includes a term $\mu N$. In a previous paper, this empirically well-known term has been formally derived from the von Neumann equation for the specific case of equilibrium. Including $\mu N$ in the system Hamiltonian leads to a modified Lindblad equation which yields the grand canonical state as a natural solution, meaning that all the quantities involved are obtained from the physics of the system without any external assumptions.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity Theorem and Fundamental Transfer Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stationary potential scattering admits a formulation in terms of the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. We use this formulation to give a proof of the reciprocity theorem in two and three dimensions that does not rely on the properties of the scattering operator, Green's functions, or Green's identities. In particular, we identify reciprocity with an operator identity satisfied by an integral operator $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$, called the fundamental transfer matrix. This is a multi-dimensional generalization of the transfer matrix $\mathbf{M}$ of potential scattering in one dimension that stores the information about the scattering amplitude of the potential. We use the property of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ that is responsible for reciprocity to identify the analog of the relation, $\det{\mathbf{M}}=1$, in two and three dimensions, and establish a generic anti-pseudo-Hermiticity of the scattering operator. Our results apply for both real and complex potentials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is essential for modern quantum information processing. Entanglement gates convert initially non-entangled states into entangled ones by applying time-dependent parametric pulses. While Bell state preparation has been experimentally validated in various platforms, its stability and fidelity are constrained by environmental decoherence and parametric fluctuations.Here, we propose a dynamical framework for preparing robust Bell states by leveraging time-boundary engineering and momentum-space projective measurements within Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) systems. Employing Lindblad master equation, we theoretically demonstrate that the prepared Bell states exhibit remarkable robustness against both environmental decoherence and parametric time fluctuations, achieving a nearly perfect quantum fidelity, with momentum conservation law governing this robust behavior. To enrich Bell states in momentum space, multi-band SSH models are designed to induce multifold time scattering processes. This time-boundary engineering framework is applicable to both fermionic and bosonic excitations, offering a robust paradigm for generating Bell states in quantum communication and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limits For Open System Dynamics Based On Representation Basis Dependent $\boldsymbol{\ell^{p}_{w}}$-Seminorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a family of quantum speed limits (QSLs) that give evolution time lower bounds between an initial and a final state whose separation is described by a certain representation basis dependent norm derived from the weighted $\ell^{p}_{w}$-seminorm. These QSLs are applicable to open, closed, time-dependent, or time-independent systems in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. They can be extended to infinite-dimensional systems as well. Crucially, these QSLs are valid for arbitrary operators, not just density matrices. When compared to the existing QSLs applied to pure state time-independent Hamiltonian evolution, qubit spontaneous emission, high-fidelity gate implementation, and operator coherence or dephasing, ours consistently show improved sharpness in most cases, along with greater universality and still retaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Particle creation from entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how entanglement entropy can drive particle creation, deriving explicit relations between entropy and the radiated particle spectrum, the total number of particles, and the total energy. Particle production is computed for scenarios that include accelerated motion, black hole evaporation, and beta decay, validating against known results while also extending them. We focus primarily on the low-entropy limit (analogous to non-relativistic motion), but also examine cases of significant particle production arising from harmonic cycles. The results establish an explicit operational link between information flow and matter creation, providing a concrete demonstration of 'it from bit'.</description>

      <title>A Superselection Rule for Quantum Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize the independent frame choice on connections between local laboratories as a symmetry principle for indefinite causal order. This induces a superselection rule that partitions process space into distinct sectors and leads to our main result: every bipartite covariant process$-$including marginals of multipartite circuits or reductions across cuts$-$is causally separable. Because covariant processes cannot be converted into noncovariant ones, all circuit-embeddable dynamics, such as the quantum switch, are forbidden from violating bipartite causal inequalities, even asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Studying the effect of the phonon coherence and inflow on the formation of hydrogen bonds in the $[(\rm{H}_2\rm{O})_2]^m$ cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a simple $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen-bonded model is proposed, and different types of phonons are introduced to describe the macro- and micro- vibrations of particles in this model. $[(\rm{H}_2\rm{O})_2]^m$ cluster consisting of hydrogen-bonded systems is considered. The effect of phonon coherence on both unitary and dissipative evolutions is studied and compared with the incoherent case. Consideration is given to the dark states -- coherent states that arise from the evolution of open quantum systems. Consideration is also given to the effect of all potential phonon inflows on evolution. The results reveal important effects of phonon coherence and inflow on the dynamics of clusters and will be used as a basis to extend the research to more complex chemical and biological models.</description>

      <title>A fluxonium qubit-based hybrid electromechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting fluxonium qubits show a highly tunable energy-level structure, with transition frequencies spanning from a few MHz to few GHz. This range is well-aligned to the operational frequencies of highly coherent micro- and nano-mechanical resonators, making fluxonium an at- tractive candidate for hybrid electromechanical systems. In this work, we theoretically investigate a flux-tunable electromechanical system consisting of a fluxonium qubit coupled to a suspended mechanical resonator. The coupling arises from the motion-induced modulation of magnetic flux through the fluxonium loop, enabling both transverse and longitudinal electromechanical interac- tions that are tunable via external magnetic fields. By optimizing the design parameters of the fluxonium qubit, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving strong resonant single-photon coupling near the flux-frustration point. We analyze the system dynamics across different coupling regimes, identifying signatures of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in the longitudinal regime and mode splitting in the transverse regime. Additionally, we show that ground-state preparation of both subsystems is possible through sideband cooling of the mechanical resonator. These results suggest that a fluxonium-based hybrid electromechanical device could be a promising platform for studying macroscopic quantum phenomena and for applications in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Energy eigenvalues of quadratic, pure quartic and quartic anharmonic oscillators with variational method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the energy eigenvalues are calculated for the quadratic ($\frac{g^2 x^2}{2}$), pure quartic ($\lambda x^4 $), and quartic anharmonic oscillators ($\frac{g^2 x^2}{2} + \lambda x^4 $) by applying variational method. For this, simple harmonic oscillator wave functions are considered as trial wave functions to calculate the energies for the ground state and first ten excited states with $g = 1$ and $\lambda =1/4$. For quartic anharmonic oscillators, energy values are calculated at different values of $\lambda$ with $g=1$. These energies for the ground state are compared with available numerically calculated data. Maximum value of $\%$error is found to be 1.9977. To get more accurate results, a new set of trial wave functions is suggested. With the newly proposed wave functions, maximum value of $\%$ error for the energy values reduces to 0.561. In this work, energies for the ground and first five excited states of quartic anharmonic oscillators are reported at different values of $\lambda$. Dependence of $\lambda$ on the wave functions is observed and concluded that wave functions are converging (shrinking) by increasing the $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Efficient utilization of imaginarity in quantum steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate the role of complex numbers in quantum information processing through the phenomenon of quantum steering. Exploiting partial knowledge of a qubit in terms of imaginarity, we formulate a steering criterion for bipartite qubit systems, which requires two dichotomic measurements at the untrusted side and two mutually unbiased bases at the trusted side. We show that quantum correlations embodied through our proposed imaginarity steering inequality can be witnessed by suitably constructed Hermitian operators that depend on fewer state parameters and require measurement of a lesser number of observables than for witnessing other forms of quantum nonlocal correlations. The monogamy of such correlations is also demonstrated. We further underscore the steering of imaginarity as an efficient nonlocal resource in the presence of white noise and under unhsarp measurements, showing the robustness of imaginarity steering compared to certain other steering criteria.</description>

      <title>Genuinely entangled subspaces beyond strongly nonlocal unextendible biseparable bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information theory reveals a clear distinction between local and nonlocal correlations through the entanglement across spatially separated subsystems. The orthogonal complement of an unextendible biseparable basis (UBB) consists entirely of genuine multipartite entangled states, representing the most robust form of such nonlocal correlations. In this letter, we provide a sufficient condition for any subspace to be genuinely entangled, enabling the systematic construction of high-dimensional genuinely entangled subspaces (GESs) from UBBs. Our construction yields the largest known GES ever obtained from a UBB. In fact, every state in this subspace is 1-distillable across every bipartition which is one of the crucial result we obtained. Furthermore, we prove that every UBB is indistinguishable under LOCC protocols, underscoring a distinct manifestation of quantum nonlocality. The UBBs we construct exhibit strong nonlocality in this scenario, making cryptographic protocols secure not only against LOCC-based attacks but also against coordinated group attacks. We introduce a no-go condition that certifies such an extreme form of nonlocality. All previously known UBBs satisfy this condition, which may lead to the misconception that strong nonlocality is an inherent property of every UBB. However, we construct a UBB that violates the no-go condition and exhibits locality across certain bipartitions, challenging conventional notions of unextendibility and nonlocality in multipartite quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Predict open quantum dynamics with data-informed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a data-informed quantum-classical dynamics (DIQCD) approach for predicting the evolution of an open quantum system. The equation of motion in DIQCD is a Lindblad equation with a flexible, time-dependent Hamiltonian that can be optimized to fit sparse and noisy data from local observations of an extensive open quantum system. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of DIQCD for both experimental and simulated quantum devices. We show that DIQCD can predict entanglement dynamics of ultracold molecules (Calcium Fluoride) in optical tweezer arrays. DIQCD also successfully predicts carrier mobility in organic semiconductors (Rubrene) with accuracy comparable to nearly exact numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Borrowing Dirty Qubits in Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirty qubits are ancillary qubits that can be borrowed from idle parts of a computation, enabling qubit reuse and reducing the demand for fresh, clean qubits-a resource that is typically scarce in practice. For such reuse to be valid, the initial states of the dirty qubits must not affect the functionality of the quantum circuits in which they are employed. Moreover, their original states, including any entanglement they possess, must be fully restored after use-a requirement commonly known as safe uncomputation. In this paper, we formally define the semantics of dirty-qubit borrowing as a feature in quantum programming languages, and introduce a notion of safe uncomputation for dirty qubits in quantum programs. We also present an efficient algorithm, along with experimental results, for verifying safe uncomputation of dirty qubits in certain quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Optimal Circuit Size for Fixed-Hamming-Weight Quantum States Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently preparing fixed-Hamming-weight (HW-$k$) quantum states, which are superpositions of $n$-qubit computational basis states with exactly $k$ ones. We present a quantum circuit construction that prepares any $n$-qubit HW-$k$ state with a circuit size of $\bo{\binom{n}{k}}$ using at most $\max\{0, n-3\}$ ancillary qubits. This is the first construction that achieves the theoretical lower bound on circuit size while using only a small number of ancillary qubits. We believe that the techniques presented in this work can be extended to other quantum state preparation algorithms based on decision diagrams, potentially reducing the reliance on ancillary qubits or lowering the overall circuit size.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Stern-Gerlach and Anomalous Bragg Diffraction Regimes of Low-energy Free Electron Interaction with Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM) have significantly impacted allied disciplines such as laser-driven accelerators and free electron radiations, collectively fostering the emergence of free-electron quantum optics (FEQO). A central objective of FEQO is to achieve coherent optical control of free electrons, analogous to light manipulation of atoms in atom optics. Motivated by this analogy, we propose an ultrafast Stern-Gerlach (USG) regime for low-energy quantum electron wavepacket (QEW), which crucially incorporates the effects of second-order dispersion inherent to slow electrons. We demonstrate that the USG diffraction induces spectral splitting and shifting of the QEW via a longitudinal electric field gradient, with the two dominant truncated sidebands forming a pseudospin degree of freedom for an effective "two-level" electron. Furthermore, by examining the wave-particle duality of the QEW during light interaction, we identify a dispersion-induced anomalous Bragg diffraction regime. This regime exhibits a distinct spectral pattern, differentiating it from these reported PINEM (Raman-Nath), dielectric laser accelerators (DLA), anomalous PINEM, and Bragg diffraction regimes. Our study provides a comprehensive classification for light-induced diffraction regimes for both swift and slow electrons. These findings underscore the pivotal role of slow-electron dispersion and duality nature in free-electron optics, offering promising avenues for electron wavefunction quantum engineering ultrafast interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reversible logic synthesis is a crucial component in quantum electronic design automation. While rule-based methodologies have gained prominence in reversible circuit optimization, the completeness of the transformation rule systems is a longstanding problem in this domain. In this work, we propose the first complete set of transformation rules for reversible circuits, comprising five fundamental rules: any two equivalent reversible circuits can be transformed into each other using the rules. To prove the completeness, a canonical circuit representation for reversible functions is introduced, and we show that every reversible function is computed by a unique reversible circuit in the canonical form, and any reversible circuit can be transformed into its canonical form by applying the rules.</description>

      <title>Efficient Non-Adaptive Quantum Algorithms for Tolerant Junta Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of deciding whether an $n$-qubit unitary (or $n$-bit Boolean function) is $\varepsilon_1$-close to some $k$-junta or $\varepsilon_2$-far from every $k$-junta, where $k$-junta unitaries act non-trivially on at most $k$ qubits and as the identity on the rest, and $k$-junta Boolean functions depend on at most $k$ variables. For constant numbers $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2$ such that $0 &lt; \varepsilon_1 &lt; \varepsilon_2 &lt; 1$, we show the following. (1)A non-adaptive $O(k\log k)$-query tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for $k$-junta unitaries when $2\sqrt{2}\varepsilon_1 &lt; \varepsilon_2$. (2)A non-adaptive tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for Boolean functions with $O(k \log k)$ quantum queries when $4\varepsilon_1 &lt; \varepsilon_2$. (3)A $2^{\widetilde{O}(k)}$-query tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for $k$-junta unitaries for any $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2$. The first algorithm provides an exponential improvement over the best-known quantum algorithms. The second algorithm shows an exponential quantum advantage over any non-adaptive classical algorithm. The third tester gives the first tolerant junta unitary testing result for an arbitrary gap.
  Besides, we adapt the first two quantum algorithms to be implemented using only single-qubit operations, thereby enhancing experimental feasibility, with a slightly more stringent requirement for the parameter gap.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic Non-Hermitian Sensing enabled by Criticality-Enhanced Topological Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian sensing is an intriguing mechanism that utilizes the nonlinear responses near the exceptional points (EPs) to amplify external perturbations with unprecedented precision. While promising transformative sensitivity, existing approaches face stringent limitations due to their reliance on quasi-static state responses and simultaneously encountering divergent noise arising from eigenstate collapse. Here, we propose a non-adiabatic sensing paradigm leveraging parameter-sensitive non-Hermitian tunneling, which surmounts the limitations of adiabatic approaches. This sensitivity, under a metric transformation, is governed by the phase change rate-modulated by the external signal-with geometric amplification, manifesting (i) criticality enhancement (quantum metric divergence near EPs) and (ii) chiral selectivity governed by path- and state-dependent imaginary intraband Berry connections. Experimentally, we validate this paradigm through direct measurements of the Fisher information on a trapped-ion platform. This work establishes a pathway to practical non-Hermitian sensing with non-Abelian non-adiabatic processes.</description>

Lett. \textbf{126}, 134803 (2021)], a solution to the Dirac equation for a relativistic Gaussian electron beam showed that for a diverging beam the spin of each electron is the sum of fractional contributions from both the spin matrix and orbital angular momentum operators. Fractional orbital angular momentum is interesting since it partially attributes electron spin to the flow of momentum in space around the spin axis. To develop this idea further, the simpler problem of an electron confined in a 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator is formulated here as a Klein-Gordon equation expressed in terms of raising and lowering operators. Two alternate Dirac equations are then obtained for the oscillator depending on whether they contain a raising or lowering operator. It is shown solutions to both these equations describe an electron having the same energy and spin but differ in that one solution contains fractional orbital angular momentum and the other does not. It is also shown that the fraction of orbital angular momentum present in spin depends on the velocity of the oscillator indicating the further interchangeability of the spin and orbital angular momentum operators through Lorentz transformations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Implementation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver to Solve QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a distributed algorithm and implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), termed distributed VQE (DVQE). DVQE, provided as an open-source Python package, enables the execution of parameterized quantum circuits across multiple logical quantum processing units (QPUs) in a distributed fashion. This approach addresses key hardware limitations of near-term quantum devices, including restricted qubit counts and limited circuit depth. Distributed ansatz circuits are constructed to preserve the quantum state fidelity of their monolithic counterparts, allowing consistent energy estimation while distributing the computational load. To improve the convergence and robustness of the optimization loop for identifying the variational parameters of the DVQE ansatz circuit, we use the ADAM optimizer in combination with metaheuristic initialization strategies, which outperform random initialization across various test cases. The complete DVQE pipeline is implemented in a modular Python package that accepts QUBO problems as input and supports monolithic and distributed execution modes. The framework leverages Qiskit to construct and simulate distributed circuits, and includes an internal greedy algorithm for automatic qubit allocation across multiple QPUs. Simulation results on QUBO benchmarks confirm the correctness of the approach, paving the way for real QPU deployment and further exploration of distributed quantum optimization. \textbf{The simulator is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DVQE.git}{GitHub} under a package named raiselab, with a collection of tutorial examples.}</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Bootstrap Sampling for AQP Error Assessment: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error assessment for Approximate Query Processing (AQP) is a challenging problem. Bootstrap sampling can produce error assessment even when the population data distribution is unknown. However, bootstrap sampling needs to produce a large number of resamples with replacement, which is a computationally intensive procedure. In this paper, we introduce a quantum bootstrap sampling (QBS) framework to generate bootstrap samples on a quantum computer and produce an error assessment for AQP query estimations. The quantum circuit design is included in this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the severity of noise in near-term quantum computing, error mitigation is essential to reduce error in quantum-computer-generated expectation values. We introduce RIDA (Random Inverse Depolarizing Approximation), a simple universal method that harnesses randomly generated circuits to estimate a given circuit's global depolarization probability and corresponding error-free expectation value. Numerical tests indicate RIDA outperforms key benchmarks, suggestive of significant accuracy improvements for applications of quantum computing across fields including physics and chemistry.</description>

      <title>Structured Quantum Baths with Memory: A QuTiP Framework for Spectral Diagnostics and Machine Learning Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a compact simulation framework for modeling open quantum systems coupled to structured, memory-retaining baths using QuTiP. Our method models the bath as a finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections, interpreted either as a physical realization or as a conceptual representation, rather than as a continuum. This explicit modeling enables direct control over non-Markovian dynamics and allows spectral diagnostics via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of system observables. Using a triangle-based bath motif and its extension to a six-qubit anisotropic fractal-like architecture, we demonstrate how spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth. Standard machine learning tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and gradient boosting can then be employed to infer bath parameters and estimate proximity to exceptional points (EPs). The results suggest that spectral analysis can serve as a unifying, quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory, simulation, and experiment, offering both a student-accessible and experimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory flow in quantum hardware. Rather than treating noise as an adversary to be eliminated, our approach views structured baths as collaborative partners, enabling controlled memory and delocalized memory and information flow for engineered quantum dynamics. In addition to its diagnostic power, the framework offers a modular and reproducible platform for teaching open quantum systems. Ultimately, we frame this as a pedagogical tool: students can pair FFT-based spectral features with lightweight ML (e.g., PCA and gradient boosting) to extract data-rich, interpretable signatures of open-system and non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing the spectral width of the 12.4-keV solid-state $^{45}$Sc isomeric resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.</description>

      <title>Improving time dynamics simulation by sampling the error unitary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to improve the error scaling of product formulas by randomly sampling the generator of their exact error unitary. Our approach takes an arbitrary product formula of time $t$, $S_k(t)$ with error $O(t^{k+1})$ and produces a stochastic formula with expected error scaling as $O(t^{2k+2})$ with respect to the exact dynamics. For a given fixed error $\epsilon$ and total evolution time $T$ this leads to an improved gate complexity of $N=O(T(T/\epsilon)^{\frac{1}{2k+1}})$ compared to the $O(T(T/\epsilon)^{\frac{1}{k}})$ gate complexity of a $k$-th order product formula. This is achieved by appending an additional circuit with depth at-most logarithmic in the number of qubits, and without needing extra ancillas. We prove that each instance of these stochastic formulas quickly concentrates to the expected value. These results are based on an exact characterization of the error unitaries for product formulas. Through extensive numerical simulations we assess the performance of this approach in several spin and fermionic systems. We show that the expansion of these error unitaries naturally leads to generalized Zassenhaus formulas, a result which could be of independent mathematical interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework for solving general time-dependent parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) using quantum variational circuits. Building on the QPINN approach, this method applies broadly to parabolic PDEs. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we focus on the 1D and 2D heat equations as representative examples and analyze its performance under constrained quantum resources. Our results show that the framework can accurately capture spatiotemporal dynamics, offering a promising direction for quantum-assisted scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect in parity-time symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has been demonstrated in both closed and open Hermitian quantum systems. While prior studies have linked the QMPE to Liouvillian exceptional points--non-Hermitian features emerged at the Liouvillian level, it remains largely elusive whether the QMPE can occur in intrinsic non-Hermitian systems, where non-Hermiticity is inherent at the Hamiltonian level. Here, we unequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable parity-time-symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Surprisingly, we find that exceptional points are neither sufficient nor necessary for the QMPE in this context, contrasting previous findings. Specifically, we show that the QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian and Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when Hermitian Hamiltonian is restored. Owing to the complete suppression of the slowest relaxation mode facilitated by parity-time symmetry, we attribute the observed QMPE to a cooperative effect of remaining relaxation modes. We obtain analytical expressions that delineate the parameter regimes supporting the QMPE. Our findings not only broaden the scope of the QMPE but also reveal its intricate interplay with non-Hermitian features beyond exceptional points.</description>

      <title>The real-time Feynman path integral for step potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex (semi-)classical paths, or instantons, form an integral part of our understanding of quantum physics. Whereas real classical paths describe classically allowed transitions in the real-time Feynman path integral, classically forbidden evolution is captured by complex semi-classical paths or instantons. In this paper, we uncover the rich, intricate nature of complex semi-classical paths and interference in the Feynman propagator of a non-relativistic quantum particle in both a smooth Woods-Saxon and a discontinuous Heaviside step potential. We demonstrate that the complex semi-classical paths are connected to caustics and may cease to exist as naive solutions to the boundary value problem when the semi-classical path encounters singularities of the potential. We generalise complex semi-classical paths to equivalence classes. Using this generalisation, we track the contribution of complex semi-classical paths beyond these singularity crossings and identify the instanton responsible for the quantum reflection. Whereas most complex contributions to the path integral are small, we demonstrate that in some cases the contribution of the complex semi-classical path is unsuppressed and persists into the semi-classical limit. Finally, we develop methods to detect the presence of complex semi-classical paths from propagation amplitudes. The structure of complex semi-classical paths and methods developed here generalises to a large set of problems in real-time quantum physics.</description>

Abstract: We give several algorithms for reconstructing quantum states of swift electrons, using maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inversion, and deep learning. We apply these algorithms to data previously recorded for an attosecond electron pulse-train to retrieve the density matrix and to analyse its physical properties. Based on the reconstructed quantum state, we obtain pulse-durations of about 245as and predict a degree of coherence of 36 per cent for radiations and excitations produced by these electrons.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Accelerated Solution of Nonlinear Equations from Variational Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational principle serves as a fundamental framework for describing equilibrium states of physical systems via the minimization or extremization of an energy-like functional. While quantum algorithms have demonstrated promising advances in efficiently solving linear problems rooted in this principle, extending these techniques to nonlinear equilibrium equations--ubiquitous in structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism--remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm tailored for fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) that directly addresses nonlinear equilibrium conditions governed by the variational principle. Our approach recasts the static nonlinear problem as a time-evolution process, enabling an effective linearization amenable to quantum acceleration. This construction permits quantum acceleration of nonlinear equilibrium computations on FTQCs. Compared to classical solvers, our method offers significant memory savings without compromising accuracy, with computational complexity scaling linearly in simulation time and independent of system size. We validate the algorithm through accurate prediction of nonlinear deformation in springs and truss systems, demonstrating its potential for scalable quantum acceleration of nonlinear physical phenomena. This work paves the way toward leveraging fault-tolerant quantum computing for complex nonlinear systems across physics and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-free interaction and maximally entangled state generation in double-giant-atom semi-infinite waveguide systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant atoms are artificial atoms that can couple to a waveguide non-locally. Previous work has shown that two giant atoms in a braided configuration can interact through a one-dimensional infinite waveguide, with both individual and collective atomic relaxation being fully suppressed. In this paper, however, we show that the decoherence-free interaction (DFI) between two giant atoms can be realized in both braided and nested configurations when the waveguide is semi-infinite. This protected interaction fails to appear in semi-infinite waveguide systems containing two separate giant atoms or two small atoms. We also study the entanglement generation between two giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional semi-infinite waveguide. The results show that the maximally entangled state is generated in both braided and nested configurations due to the formation of DFI, and in the separate configuration, the maximally achievable entanglement can exceed 0.5. This study presents a new scheme for realizing DFI and generating maximally entangled states in giant-atom waveguide-QED systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating monitoring-induced topological phase transitions with small systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological properties of open quantum lattice systems have attracted much attention, due to their fundamental significance and potential applications. However, experimental demonstrations with large-scale lattice models remain challenging. On top of that, formulations of topology in terms of quantum trajectories require monitoring along with the detection of quantum jumps. This is particularly the case for the dark state-induced topology that relies on averaging quantum trajectories at their jump times. Here, we propose two significant simplifications to ease the experimental burden to demonstrate dark-state induced topological phase transitions: First, we emulate the topology in the phase space of small systems, where the effective size of the system is reflected by the accessible parameter range. Second, we develop a method how to, by augmenting the system with an auxiliary system, access the jump-time averaged state through standard wall-time averaging, which effectively substitutes the monitoring along with the counting of quantum jumps. While these simplifications are applicable to general lattice systems, we demonstrate them with a one-dimensional Su-Schrieeffer-Heeger model. In this case, the lattice system is emulated by a four-level system, while the jump-time averaged state up to the second jump is accessed through a three-level auxiliary system.</description>

      <title>Selective excitation of a single rare-earth ion in an optical fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-coupled single-photon source is an essential component for the implementation of optical quantum communication technologies. Using the rare-earth ion doped in an optical fiber as an emitter is a significant method to construct such photon source at room temperature, as well as achieving high coupling and channeling efficiency. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated the generation of single photons at room temperature by selectively exciting a sole rare-earth ion isolated within a tapered silica fiber. The key advantages of our method are the ability to manipulate a purely single ion, and the efficient collection of photons from the guided mode of the fiber, owing to the single ion's emission of photons directly within the fiber. These features make our system a promising building block for realizing all-fiber-integrated optical quantum networks. We have also measured the optical lifetime of a single neodymium ion in the tapered fiber, and the result supports that the single-photon correlation time is practically determined by the absorption time of the ion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables.In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>

      <title>A Unsupervised Framework for Identifying Diverse Quantum Phase Transitions Using Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general machine learning methodology that integrates classical shadow representations with unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) to explore various quantum phase transitions. By sampling spin configurations from random Pauli measurements, our approach can effectively analyze hidden statistical patterns in the data, thereby capturing the distinct signatures of quantum criticality through their fluctuations. We benchmark this approach across various spin-1/2 systems, including the 1D XZX cluster-Ising model, the 1D bond-alternating XXZ model, the 2D transverse-field Ising model, and the 2D Kitaev honeycomb model. We show that PCA not only reliably detects and distinguishes both symmetry-breaking and topological transitions, but also enables their qualitative classification based on characteristic fluctuation patterns. Our data-driven approach does not require any knowledge of the Hamiltonian or explicit order parameters, and can therefore be a general and applicable tool for probing new quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Dynamic rerouting and interruption resilience of quantum communication via single-photon-based resynchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a resynchronization method for quantum key distribution (QKD) systems that enables rapid and reliable recovery from interruptions of the quantum channel and changes of its optical path length. By periodically transmitting short fixed pulse patterns over the quantum channel, our approach achieves swift clock offset recovery, typically within a few hundred milliseconds. We implemented this method in our time-bin-phase BB84 QKD system, demonstrating successful resynchronization after multi-minute channel interruptions and fiber length changes exceeding 100 km. The method can be retrofitted to existing systems via a software upgrade and without hardware changes, allowing for broad applicability. In total, the resynchronization method significantly enhances QKD system resilience and allows for reliable operation in challenging environments such as dynamically routed optical networks, i.e., software-defined networks, and free-space optical links with mobile nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational power of symmetry-protected phases of matter can be accessed through local measurements, but what is the most efficient way of doing so? In this work, we show that minimizing operational resources in measurement-based quantum computation on subsystem symmetric resource states amounts to solving a sub-Riemannian geodesic problem between the identity and the target logical unitary. This reveals a geometric structure underlying MBQC and offers a principled route to optimize quantum processing in computational phases.</description>

      <title>C60 fullerene as an on-demand single photon source at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photon sources are fundamental for applications in quantum computing, secure communication, and sensing, as they enable the generation of individual photons and ensure strict control over photon number statistics. However, current single photon sources can be limited by a lack of robustness, difficulty of integration into existing optical or electronic devices, and high cost. In this study, we present the use of off-the-shelf \ch{C60} fullerene molecules embedded in polystyrene as room-temperature reliable single-photon emitters. As our results demonstrate, these molecules exhibit on-demand single-photon emission, with short fluorescence lifetimes and, consequently, high emission rates. The wide availability and ease of preparation and manipulation of fullerenes as single photon sources can pave the way for the development of practical, economic and scalable quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Succession of Ising criticality and its threshold in critical quantum Ising model subject to symmetric decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a mixed state quantum criticality in the Ising model under $X+ZZ$ decoherence. In the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decohered state resides on the self-dual critical line of the quantum Ashkin-Teller (qAT) model, as a result of the specific choice of the decoherence channel. On the other hand, since the mixed state under $X+ZZ$ decoherence satisfies the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in a weak sense, the Ising criticality of the pure state can be partially preserved in the mixed system. By making use of the combination of the doubled Hilbert space formalism and matrix product states, we carry out extensive numerical study to elucidate the mixed state criticality. We find that under decoherence up to moderate strength, the mixed states on the critical line have properties of the Ising CFT, where $c=1/2$, $\eta=0.25$ and, $\nu=1$. These values of the central charge and critical exponents contrast with the ones in the $c=1$ orbifold boson CFT describing the critical state of the qAT model. In addition, we also observe the threshold of the mixed Ising CFT. The strong decoherence washes out the remnant Ising criticality and induces strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the analogy between following the motion of a reflected wave packet, and a quantum measurement of the spatial delay imposed on the particle by the scattering potential. It is shown that converting such delays into temporal durations can lead to \e{negative times}, and best be avoided. It is also demonstrated that a \e{soft} potential can be replaced by superposition of hard walls. This representation is used for calculating the Goos-H\"anchen shift of a Gaussian beam incident on a potential step or a barrier at an oblique angle.</description>

      <title>Strong spin-magnon coupling in a van der Waals magnet with tunable chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies require platforms that can coherently interface qubits with bosonic excitations. Photons have traditionally played this role in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but achieving the same goal using solid-state bosons remains challenging. Here we demonstrate strong and tunable spin-magnon coupling between molecular spin qubits and magnons in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator. Using [Gd(W$_5$O$_{18}$)$_{2}$]$^{9-}$ as the spin ensemble and CrSBr as the magnonic resonator, we observe anticrossings and coherent hybridization, realizing magnon quantum electrodynamics for the first time. Crucially, by rotating the magnetic field, we can dynamically change the magnon symmetry from linear to chiral, enabling in-situ tuning of the coupling strength. Our results establish magnonic cavities as a platform for scalable chiral quantum optics with magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Detection with Quantum-inspired Kernels and SVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a machine learning approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) for quantum entanglement detection. Particularly, we focus in bipartite systems of dimensions 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, where the positive partial transpose criterion (PPT) provides only partial characterization. Using SVMs with quantum-inspired kernels we develop a classification scheme that distinguishes between separable states, PPT-detectable entangled states, and entangled states that evade PPT detection. Our method achieves increasing accuracy with system dimension, reaching 80%, 90%, and nearly 100% for 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 systems, respectively. Our results show that principal component analysis significantly enhances performance for small training sets. The study reveals important practical considerations regarding purity biases in the generation of data for this problem and examines the challenges of implementing these techniques on near-term quantum hardware. Our results establish machine learning as a powerful complement to traditional entanglement detection methods, particularly for higher-dimensional systems where conventional approaches become inadequate. The findings highlight key directions for future research, including hybrid quantum-classical implementations and improved data generation protocols to overcome current limitations.</description>

      <title>A Metropolitan-scale Multiplexed Quantum Repeater with Bell Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters can overcome exponential photon loss in optical fibers, enabling heralded entanglement between distant quantum memories. The definitive benchmark for this entanglement is Bell nonlocality, a cornerstone for device-independent security and foundational tests of quantum mechanics. However, recent metropolitan-scale demonstrations based on single-photon interference (SPI) schemes have been limited to generating low-quality entanglement, falling short of Bell nonlocality certification. Here, we report the heralded entanglement distribution between two solid-state quantum memories separated by 14.5 km, using a two-photon interference (TPI) scheme based on time measurements combined with large-capacity temporal multiplexing. We generate a Bell state with a fidelity of $78.6\pm2.0 \%$, achieving a CHSH-Bell inequality violation by 3.7 standard deviations, marking the first certification of Bell nonlocality in metropolitan-scale quantum repeaters. Our architecture effectively combines the high heralding rate of SPI schemes with the phase robustness of TPI schemes, enabling autonomous quantum node operation without the need for fiber channel phase stabilization, thus providing a practical framework for scalable quantum-repeater networks.</description>

      <title>Numerical implementation of the partial secular approximation and unified master equation in structured open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is typically described through Lindblad equations, which are derived from the Redfield equation via the full secular approximation. The latter neglects the rotating terms in the master equation corresponding to pairs of jump operators with different Bohr frequencies. However, for many physical systems this approximation breaks down, and thus a more accurate treatment of the slowly rotating terms is required. Indeed, more precise physical results can be obtained by performing the partial secular approximation, which takes into account the relevant time scale associated with each pair of jump operators and compares it with the time scale arising from the system-environment coupling. In this work, we introduce a general code for performing the partial secular approximation in the Redfield equation for structured open quantum systems. The code can be applied to a generic Hamiltonian of any multipartite system coupled to bosonic baths. Moreover, it can also reproduce the unified master equation, which captures the same physical behavior as the Redfield equation under the partial secular approximation, but is mathematically guaranteed to generate a completely positive dynamical map. Finally, the code can compute both the local and global version of the master equation for the same physical problem. We illustrate the code by studying the steady-state heat flow in a structured open quantum system composed of two superconducting qubits, each coupled to a bosonic mode, which in turn interacts with a thermal bath. The results in this work can be employed for the numerical study of a wide range of complex open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing quantum routing implicitly mimics classical routing principles, with finding the ``best'' path (aka pathfinding), according to a selected routing metric, as a core mechanism for establishing end-to-end entanglement. However, optimal pathfinding is computationally intensive, particularly in complex topologies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to quantum routing, which avoids the inherent overhead of conventional quantum pathfinding, by establishing directly entanglement between remote nodes. Our approach exploits graph complement strategies. It allows to improve the flexibility and efficiency of quantum networks, by paving the way for more practical quantum communication infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time Extraction of Entanglement Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraction of EPR pairs and n-qubits GHZ states among remote nodes in quantum networks constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand communications. However, the Bell-VM problem, which determines whether a given graph state can be transformed into a set of Bell pairs on specific vertices (not necessarily remote), is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend this problem, not only by focusing on nodes remote within generic graph states, but also by determining the number of extractable n-qubit remote GHZ states -- beside the number of remote EPR pairs. The rationale for tackling the extraction of GHZ states among remote nodes, rather than solely remote EPR pairs, is that a GHZ state enables the dynamic extraction of an EPR pair between any pair of nodes sharing the state. This, in turn, implies the ability of accommodating the traffic requests on-the-fly. Specially, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the aforementioned NP-complete problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to effectively adapt to generic graph states for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of nonlinear superconducting quantum circuits often relies on time-consuming iterative electromagnetic simulations requiring manual intervention. These interventions entail, for example, adjusting design variables such as resonator lengths or Josephson junction energies to meet target parameters such as mode frequencies, decay rates, and coupling strengths. Here, we present a method to efficiently automate the optimization of superconducting circuits, which significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. The method's efficiency arises from user-defined, physics-informed, nonlinear models that guide parameter updates toward the desired targets. Additionally, we provide a full implementation of our optimization method as an open-source Python package, QDesignOptimizer. The package automates the design workflow by combining high-accuracy electromagnetic simulations in Ansys HFSS and Energy Participation Ratio (pyEPR) analysis integrated with the design tool Qiskit-Metal. Our implementation supports modular and flexible subsystem-level analysis and is easily extensible to optimize for additional parameters. The method is not specific to superconducting circuits; as such, it can be applied to a range of nonlinear optimization problems across science and technology.</description>

      <title>Generation of Quantum Entanglement in Autonomous Thermal Machines: Effects of Non-Markovianity, Hilbert Space Structure, and Quantum Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of entanglement generation in an external quantum system interacting with a quantum autonomous thermal machine (QATM) under a non-Markovian dynamics. Indeed, the QATM is composed of two non-coupled qubits. Each qubit is coupled to an independent thermal reservoir, where each reservoir interacts with an external system of two additional non-coupled qubits. By analyzing the Hilbert space structure, energy level configurations, and temperature gradients, we define two thermodynamic cycles, namely A and B, governed by virtual temperatures and energy-conserving transitions. We demonstrate that the QATM can act as a structured reservoir able to induce non-Markovian memory effects. In fact, the non-Markovian dynamics is highlighted basically for negative entropy production rates. However, by quantitatively measuring the mutual information and concurrence, we show that the entanglement is generated only in cycle A, supported by the non-Markovian dynamics and strong presence of entanglement. Hence, we conclude that our results using feasible experimental parameters demonstrate that temperature differences, Hilbert space structure and coherence can be used as good quantum resources for controlling and boosting entanglement in quantum thermodynamic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum switch, a process enabling a coherent superposition of different orders of quantum channels, has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable noiseless communications through noisy channels, such as entanglement-breaking channels. However, its practical implementation and scalability remain challenging. In contrast, the spatial superposition of quantum channels is more accessible experimentally and has been shown to enhance channel capacity, although it does not match the performance of the quantum switch. In this work, we present preliminary theoretical results demonstrating that, by applying tools of the quantum random walk framework to the spatial superposition of channels, it is possible to replicate the output of a quantum switch. These findings suggest a promising and more feasible route to emulate the quantum switch, offering both practical advantages and interpretative clarity.</description>

      <title>Correlation Enhanced Autonomous Quantum Battery Charging via Structured Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the charging dynamics of a quantum battery coupled to a structured reservoir composed of two qubits, each in thermal equilibrium with its own bosonic bath. The structured reservoir interacts with a charger battery model through three distinct configurations: (I) direct coupling between the reservoir qubits and the battery, (II) common coupling between the reservoir qubits, the charger, and the battery, and (III) common coupling between the reservoir qubits and the charger, together with a local charger battery interaction. For both incoherent and coherent initial states, we analyze the stored energy, ergotropy, and charging power of the battery, and establish upper and lower bounds on the maximum extractable work of the battery based on the free energy of coherence, and exchanged correlations between the subsystems. Our results show that the nature of the interaction scenario and the presence of coherence crucially determine the efficiency of charging and the maximum ergotropy. We demonstrate that correlation exchange between subsystems, quantified by the difference between global and local coherence, acts as a resource for work extraction. These findings provide a deeper understanding of coherence and population and structured environments as resources for autonomous quantum batteries, and offer experimentally accessible predictions within the regime of superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Low-rank optimal control of quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control is essential for designing high-fidelity quantum operations, but computational demands often limit its application to realistic quantum devices. We apply a computational framework that dramatically reduces the computational cost while maintaining predictive accuracy through the low-rank approximation for simulating open quantum system dynamics. The key insight is that most quantum operation protocols maintain the system in nearly pure states throughout their execution. This enables an efficient representation of the density matrix with rank-$M$ matrices where $M \ll N$ , $N$ being the Hilbert space dimension, achieving substantial speedups without sacrificing accuracy. We benchmark our approach on the optimization of the transmon qubit dispersive readout in a realistic transmon-resonator-filter model with Hilbert space dimension $N = 2000$. Using only $M = 20$, we achieve an 81-fold speedup compared to full master equation integration while accurately reproducing all relevant observables. By combining the low-rank approximation with a compact pulse parametrization and gradient-free optimization, we obtain state-of-the-art readout assignment errors $\varepsilon_a \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ for a 40 ns readout pulse schedule, while comfortably running on a laptop and not relying on the rotating-wave approximation. Our approach is broadly applicable to most quantum control protocols, including quantum gates, state preparation, and fast reset operations. It represents a powerful resource and a step forward in quantum optimal control, making accurate large-scale device optimization more accessible with greatly reduced computational resources and accelerating progress toward scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Breaking conservation law enables steady-state entanglement out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how entangled steady states can be prepared by purely dissipative dynamics in a system coupled to a thermal environment. While entanglement is hindered by thermalization when the system and environment exchange a conserved quantity, we demonstrate that breaking this conservation law through the system-environment interaction drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state. Such an interaction will generate multiple competing equilibration channels, effectively mimicking baths at distinct chemical potentials. When the environment also supports long-range correlations, these channels mediate nonlocal dissipation capable of generating entanglement. We illustrate the scheme in a model of two color centers weakly coupled to a spin-pumped magnet, where tuneable magnon excitations enable steady-state entanglement over finite distances. Our results outline a scalable approach to dissipative entanglement generation, rooted in the conservation structure and environmental correlations rather than fine-tuned coherent control or active driving.</description>

      <title>Simulating Electron Transfer on Noisy Quantum Computers: A Scalable Approach to Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating large electronic networks with vibrational environments remains a fundamental challenge due to the long lifetimes of electronic-vibrational (vibronic) excitations on the picosecond scale. Quantum computers are a promising platform to simulate the dynamics of open quantum systems aided by intrinsic hardware-noise, with successful demonstrations of models with two electronic sites. We simulated a microscopic model of electron-transfer (ET) with a single donor and up to nine acceptor sites on a superconducting processor of IBM, using a model-specific error mitigation scheme. Our results using up to 20 qubits reveal a probability of ET that is well aligned with classical calculations where electronic and vibronic transfer resonances can be identified at the expected driving forces. We conducted 10 independent experiments per system size on different days, accounting for hourly fluctuations in error rates. We find that the most important ingredient for large-scale simulations is a large number of available qubits connected by high-fidelity gates, with coherence times above the threshold set by the target open system. Because the vibronic mechanism of electron transfer is entanglement-driven, our simulation is a natural application-based benchmark, in which the hardware capacity to produce and sustain entanglement is quantified by the maximum system size for which the hardware produces accurate results.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Heuristic for Molecular Docking on Neutral-Atom Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a critical computational method in drug discovery used to predict the binding conformation and orientation of a ligand within a protein's binding site. Mapping this challenge onto a graph-based problem, specifically the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, allows it to be addressed by specialized hardware such as neutral-atom quantum processors. However, a significant bottleneck has been the size mismatch between biologically relevant molecular systems and the limited capacity of near-term quantum devices. In this work, we overcome this scaling limitation by the use of a novel divide-and-conquer heuristic introduced in Cazals et al. This algorithm enables the solution of large-scale MWIS problems by decomposing a single, intractable graph instance into smaller sub-problems that can be solved sequentially on a neutral-atom quantum emulator, incurring only a linear computational overhead. We demonstrate the power of this approach by solving a 540-node MWIS problem representing the docking of an inhibitor to the Tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ Converting Enzyme--thiol-containing Aryl Sulfonamide (TACE-AS) complex. Our work enables the application of quantum methods to more complex and physically realistic molecular systems than previously possible, paving the way for tackling large-scale docking challenges on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Learning for Multiclass Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the challenge of improving multiclass image classification through quantum machine-learning techniques. It explores how the discarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical classifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit states after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain entangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is lost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the conventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully connected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately process measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are ensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a classical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to adapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing discarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid quantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification.</description>

      <title>Observation of hysteresis in an isolated quantum system of disordered Heisenberg spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find energy-dependent hysteresis in an isolated Heisenberg quantum spin system, similar to thermomagnetic hysteresis in canonical spin glasses in contact with a thermal reservoir. Analogous to zero-field cooling and field cooling in conventional magnetic materials, an annealing protocol is devised to control the energy in an isolated system. Depending on the strength of disorder, the susceptibilities at zero field bifurcate at a specific energy, which signals the presence of different magnetic regimes. This behavior is apparent both in a numerical simulation by exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve particles, as well as in an experiment with thousands of Rydberg atoms representing dipolar interacting quantum spins. The annealing protocols open a new path to explore the energy-dependent phase structure of spin systems at low energies. Our observation of a nonthermal metastable regime might indicate the existence of a phase transition to a novel state of isolated quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay between trimer structure and magnetic ground state in Ba5Ru3O12 probed by Neutron and muSR techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06113v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) investigation of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals two distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at 10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these magnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above TN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations, which agree with the experimentally observed spin excitation</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of the causal diamond horizon: A hidden property of the inertial propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in Phys. Rev. D 100, 045024 (2019), we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In this method, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Furthermore, we find that the ratio of emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. We then extend the analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a meticulous analysis of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent chiral transport and chiral solitons in spin Kitaev models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</description>

      <title>Correlations in the Binding Energy of Triexcitons and Biexcitons in Single CdSe/CdS Nanoplatelets Revealed by Heralded Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanoplatelets present reduced Auger recombination, giving rise to enhanced multiexciton emission. This virtue makes them good candidates to investigate higher-order carrier dynamics, allowing to extract important excitonic properties, such as biexciton and triexciton binding energies that highly influence applications involving high excitation fluxes. Here, we explore triexciton emission, emanating from single core/shell CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets. We apply heralded post-selection of photon triplets using an advanced home-built single-photon spectrometer in order to resolve the triexciton$-$biexciton$-$exciton$-$ground state cascaded relaxation both in time and spectrum, and unambiguously determine the triexciton relaxation route and interaction nature. The results show a characteristic blue shift of the biexciton and triexciton, pointing to repulsive multiexciton interaction in the nanoplatelets under study. The relatively small measured energy shift of the triexciton (5.9 $\pm$ 0.7 meV) indicates that it recombines through the 1S bands rather than the 1P bands, in agreement with findings on other colloidal quantum dot systems. Most importantly, the strong correlation between the biexciton and triexciton binding energies, and the ability to tune them via control of the particle dimensions and composition, paves the way for developing emitters of nearly degenerate photon triplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-efficient computing is becoming increasingly important in the information era. However, electronic computers with von Neumann architecture can hardly meet the challenge due to the inevitable energy-intensive data movement, especially when tackling computationally hard problems or complicated tasks. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an energy-efficient photonic computer that solves intractable subset sum problem (SSP) by making use of the extremely low energy level of photons (~10^(-19) J) and a time-of-flight storage technique. We show that the energy consumption of the photonic computer maintains no larger than 10^(-15) J per operation at a reasonably large problem size N=33, and it consumes 10^(8) times less energy than the most energy-efficient supercomputer for a medium-scale problem. In addition, when the photonic computer is applied to deal with real-life problems that involves iterative computation of the SSP, the photonic advantage in energy consumption is further enhanced and massive energy can be saved. Our results indicate the superior competitiveness of the photonic computer in the energy costs of complex computation, opening a possible path to green computing.</description>

      <title>Phantom BTZ Black Holes: Thermal Properties Under Perturbative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes by incorporating leading-order perturbative corrections arising from small statistical fluctuations around equilibrium. Starting from the phantom BTZ black holes review, we describe a modified action in three-dimensional spacetime that includes coupling with a Maxwell or phantom field. The analysis derives the corresponding field equations and obtains exact solutions for the metric and thermodynamic quantities. The corrected entropy is computed using the steepest descent method. It is expressed in terms of the leading-order entropy and Hawking temperature. Standard thermodynamic relations yield the corrected mass, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, and Gibbs free energy. These corrections reveal significant deviations from classical results, particularly in the small black hole regime where statistical effects become prominent. Graphical analysis shows that the corrected entropy becomes negative for sufficiently small black holes, indicating potential limitations in thermodynamic stability under perturbative corrections. Furthermore, the influence of thermal fluctuations proves substantial for the small black holes and negligible for larger black holes. In this work, we have also calculated critical points and critical compressibility factor ($Z_{c}$) of the phantom BTZ black hole, treating it as a Van der Waals fluid. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how statistical fluctuations modify the thermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes. It underscores the necessity of including such corrections in realistic models of black hole thermodynamics in $(2+1)$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution for Two $\delta$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $\delta$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of spacetime: A quantum optics view of acceleration radiation and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the centennial of quantum mechanics, we offer an overview of the central role played by quantum information and thermalization in problems involving fundamental properties of spacetime and gravitational physics. This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Design of broadband optical gain in GaSb-based waveguide amplifiers with asymmetric quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A design strategy for achieving broadband optical gain in GaSb-based semiconductor amplifiers operating beyond 2 \mu m is presented. By employing asymmetric GaInSb/AlGaAsSb quantum wells (QWs) of varying thicknesses, a flat and wide gain spectrum is demonstrated. The approach leverages carrier density and transition energy tuning across QWs to access various energy levels at specific current densities. Simulations using "Harold" self-consistent environment predict a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) gain bandwidth exceeding 340 nm for a structure comprising one 7 nm and three 13 nm-thick QWs. The modelling parameters were validated against experimental data, ensuring a robust framework for designing broadband amplifiers and superluminescent diodes for mid-infrared applications.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of higher-order cumulants in quantum isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding universal behavior of far-from-equilibrium transport dynamics at a quantum many body level is a longstanding challenge. In particular, a full characterization of universal dynamics of nonlocal correlation functions still remains largely unknown. In this letter, we uncover universal scaling laws of higher-order cumulants in one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, revealing anomalous behaviors of nonequilibrium dynamics exclusively accessible in higher-order correlations. By means of numerical simulations and full counting statistics, we determine the power laws of both the spin polarization transfer and contrast cumulants for different kinds of helix and domain-wall initial states. Building on such physical states, we unify the scaling behavior of the higher-order cumulants, giving rise to two types of dynamics: anomalous diffusive and superdiffusive. For the former, these higher cumulants show a deviation from Gaussian statistics, with the scaling exponents being identical for the first four orders. For the latter, however, we observe a breakdown of KPZ universality, with the exponents of the third and fourth orders differing significantly from those of the first two. Our results are also agreeable with recent experimental observations, advancing understanding of far-from-equilibrium transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>The holographic dual of the GHZ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current holographic research mostly focuses on a subset of quantum systems with a classical gravity dual. Although the precise boundary of this subset remains unknown, certain constraints are recognized; for instance, holographic entropies obey inequalities that are violated by general quantum states such as the GHZ states. This paper, however, presents a gravity dual for GHZ states -- a non-ordinary geometry termed the booklet wormhole. We demonstrate an exact match for all entropy properties with the GHZ state, as well as the identity of the Euclidean partition functions for both systems. The booklet wormhole circumvents the conventional holographic entropy inequalities because different topologies are inevitably included in the gravitational path integral, even in the large-$N$ limit. This provides the first explicit holographic duality with a non-perturbative quantum effect. Remarkably, the construction is simple and maximally entangled, making it ideal for gedanken experiments.</description>

Abstract: We develop a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to numerically evaluate the Lehmann representation for the finite temperature single-particle Green's function in the repulsive Lieb-Liniger model.

      <description>arXiv:2508.17947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is the fundamental framework of nature, and gravitational waves from binary black holes should likewise be analyzed quantum mechanically. It is commonly assumed that their classical description corresponds to a coherent state, so any deviation would signal genuinely quantum nature of gravity. We show that the coherent-state description reproduces classical gravitational waves at leading order, while next-order effects generate squeezed states of gravitons. For GW150914, we estimate the squeezing parameter to be $\sim 10^{-3}$. Detection of such squeezing with LIGO, Virgo, or KAGRA would provide direct evidence for the quantization of gravity.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity in V-Al alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range.Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Casimir method for determining the dispersive force by varying zero vacuum energy fluctuations is applied to two graphene sheets in the approximation of the Drude model for surface conductivity. As an alternative, the Van Kampen summation method is used. The force is determined for small and for large distances between the sheets. The results of both models are quite similar. Precisely, at large distances, the attractive force decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At short distances, the force is a finite attractive one. With a small chemical potential, the force can have a minimum at distances of the order of 0.3 nm, then increases, reaches a maximum at distances of the order of 200 nm, and at large distances decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At a chemical potential of significantly more than 1 eV, a minimum is not observed.</description>

      <title>Dual-Frequency Absorption Spectroscopy in Laser-Cooled Rubidium Atoms: Theoretical Modeling and Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate dual-frequency absorption spectroscopy (DFAS) using laser-cooled 87Rb and 85Rb atoms. Doppler-free resonances with high-contrast are produced, which suggest the suitability of using dual-frequency absorption spectroscopy (DFAS) for laser stabilization in a cold-atom-based coherent population trapping (CPT) clock, and for developing a compact, high-performance optical frequency standard using an integrated magneto-optical trap (MOT). We developed a model using density-matrix equations to accurately simulate DFAS in the atomic medium without applying any simplifying approximations. Comprehensive simulations are performed using our multi-level system model to analyze dual-frequency spectra produced in cold atom ensembles under different experimental conditions, including the effect of magnetic field, and two-photon detuning. The simulations accurately yield amplitudes, linewidths, frequency shifts, and lineshapes of DFAS resonances under these experimental conditions. We also demonstrate a simple mechanism for performing CPT spectroscopy by implementing a DFAS laser lock using trapped atoms in the MOT. Additionally, we have extended our model to accurately model the dual-frequency spectrum produced in rubidium cell, which is a medium of practical interest for vapor-cell-based quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ideal electrometer should measure electric fields accurately while causing minimal disturbance to the field itself. Rydberg atomic electrometers are promising candidates for ideal electrometry due to their SI traceability and non-invasive nature. However, in practice, the atomic vapor cell shell can distort the electric field, limiting the device's performance. In this work, we overcome this challenge by fabricating a chip-scale vapor cell using a novel combination of femtosecond laser writing and optical contact. This method enables the development of a non-invasive atomic electrometer with a radar cross-section (RCS) 20 dB lower than that of commercial atomic cell-based electrometers. Furthermore, we observe a new sub-Doppler spectral narrowing phenomenon in these chip-scale cells. The effect originates from an incoherent, collision-driven mechanism--hereafter referred to as incoherent Dicke narrowing (ICDN). This advancement supports future revisions to the international system of units and broadens applications in metrology and quantum measurement.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Vorticity and Viscous Stress in Finite Scale Quantum Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Madelung equations offer a hydrodynamic description of quantum systems, from single particles to quantum fluids. In this formulation, the probability density is mapped onto the fluid density and the phase is treated as a scalar potential generating the velocity field. As examples of potential flows, quantum fluids described in this way are inherently irrotational, but quantum vortices may arise at discrete points where the phase is undefined. In this paper, starting from this irrotational description of a quantum fluid, a coarse-graining procedure is applied to arrive at a macroscopic description of the quantum fluid in which the role of velocity is played by a Favre average of the microscopic velocity field, allowing for finite vorticity at any point in the fluid. It is shown that this vorticity obeys a similar equation to the vorticity equation in classical hydrodynamics and includes a vortex-stretching term. This coarse-graining procedure also gives rise to novel stress terms in the fluid equations, which in the appropriate limit appear analogous to artificial viscous stresses from computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-foundational implications of information erasure upon measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A projective measurement cannot decrease the von Neumann entropy if the outcome is ignored. However, under certain sound assumptions and using the quantum violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities, we have previously demonstrated that this property is not inherited by a classical simulation of such a measurement process. In the simulation, a measurement erases prior information by partially resetting the system, suggesting that the quantum-state update following a measurement cannot be entirely epistemic. The erasure of information has been proved by assuming that the maximally mixed quantum state corresponds to maximal ignorance of the classical state. A more intricate proof employed the weaker hypothesis that the entropy is finite at some stage of the simulation. In this paper, we focus on the quantum-foundational implications of this theorem. We first provide a simple proof by directly using the second hypothesis. Second, we identify information erasure as the mechanism breaking the time symmetry in ontological theories. This symmetry break has been previously proved by Pusey and Leifer. Third, we show that information erasure and, thus, symmetry break can be avoided by employing a branching a la many-worlds theory. The information flow and the time asymmetry are transferred to the measurement devices and the subsequent comparison of results, which inherently involve time-asymmetric processes. Thus, causality and the absence of information erasure suggest that measurements have multiple actual outcomes. Similarly, Deutsch and Hayden argued that Bell's theorem leads to the same conclusion if locality is given for granted. We conclude by showing that the problem of the clumsiness loophole in an experimental Leggett-Garg test of macrorealism is mitigated by the information-erasure theorem.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate Marginal-Likelihood Calibration with Application to Quantum Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a marginal likelihood strategy within the Kennedy-O'Hagan (KOH) Bayesian framework, where a Gaussian process (GP) models the discrepancy between a physical system and its simulator. Our approach introduces a novel marginalized likelihood by integrating out the degenerate eigenspace of the covariance matrix, rather than approximating the original likelihood. Unlike approximation methods that compromise accuracy for computational efficiency, our method defines an exact likelihood -- distinct from the original but preserving all relevant information. This formulation achieves computational efficiency and stability, even for large datasets where the covariance matrix nears degeneracy. Applied to the characterization of a superconducting quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the approach enhances the predictive accuracy of the Lindblad master equations for modeling Ramsey measurement data by effectively quantifying uncertainties consistent with the quantum data.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant hyperbolic Floquet quantum error correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central goal in quantum error correction is to reduce the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computing by increasing noise thresholds and reducing the number of physical qubits required to sustain a logical qubit. We introduce a potential path towards this goal based on a family of dynamically generated quantum error correcting codes that we call "hyperbolic Floquet codes.'' These codes are defined by a specific sequence of non-commuting two-body measurements arranged periodically in time that stabilize a topological code on a hyperbolic manifold with negative curvature. We focus on a family of lattices for $n$ qubits that, according to our prescription that defines the code, provably achieve a finite encoding rate $(1/8+2/n)$ while still requiring only two-body measurements. Similar to hyperbolic surface codes, the distance of the code at each time-step scales at most logarithmically in $n$. The family of lattices we choose indicates that this scaling is achievable in practice. We develop and benchmark an efficient matching-based decoder that provides evidence of a threshold near 0.1% in a phenomenological noise model and 0.25% in an entangling measurements noise model. Utilizing weight-two check operators and a qubit connectivity of 3, one of our hyperbolic Floquet codes uses 400 physical qubits to encode 52 logical qubits with a code distance of 8, i.e., it is a $[[400,52,8]]$ code. At small error rates, comparable logical error suppression to this code requires 5x as many physical qubits (1924) when using the honeycomb Floquet code with the same noise model and decoder.</description>

      <title>Does provable absence of barren plateaus imply classical simulability?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large amount of effort has recently been put into understanding the barren plateau phenomenon. In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud elephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but not explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barren plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We collect evidence-on a case-by-case basis-that many commonly used models whose loss landscapes avoid barren plateaus can also admit classical simulation, provided that one can collect some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. Thus, while stressing that quantum computers can be essential for collecting data, our analysis sheds doubt on the information processing capabilities of many parametrized quantum circuits with provably barren plateau-free landscapes. We end by discussing the (many) caveats in our arguments including the limitations of average case arguments, the role of smart initializations, models that fall outside our assumptions, the potential for provably superpolynomial advantages and the possibility that, once larger devices become available, parametrized quantum circuits could heuristically outperform our analytic expectations.</description>

      <title>Batched Line Search Strategy for Navigating through Barren Plateaus in Quantum Circuit Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05227v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are viewed as promising candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage on near-term devices. These approaches typically involve the training of parameterized quantum circuits through a classical optimization loop. However, they often encounter challenges attributed to the exponentially diminishing gradient components, known as the barren plateau (BP) problem. This work introduces a novel optimization approach designed to alleviate the adverse effects of BPs during circuit training. In contrast to conventional gradient descent methods with a small learning parameter, our approach relies on making a finite hops along the search direction determined on a randomly chosen subsets of the free parameters. The optimization search direction, together with the range of the search, is determined by the distant features of the cost-function landscape. This enables the optimization path to navigate around barren plateaus without the need for external control mechanisms. We have successfully applied our optimization strategy to quantum circuits comprising 21 qubits and 15000 entangling gates, demonstrating robust resistance against BPs. Additionally, we have extended our optimization strategy by incorporating an evolutionary selection framework, enhancing its ability to avoid local minima in the landscape. The modified algorithm has been successfully utilized in quantum gate synthesis applications, showcasing a significantly improved efficiency in generating highly compressed quantum circuits compared to traditional gradient-based optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computer-Based Verification of Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19293v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations establish fundamental trade-offs between the precision achievable in quantum systems and associated thermodynamic quantities such as entropy production or dynamical activity. While foundational, empirical demonstrations have thus far been confined to specific cases, either assuming time-reversal symmetry or involving particular measurement types, leaving the verification of their universal validity unrealized. This work leverages a quantum computer to report the first empirical verification of a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, valid for arbitrary dynamics and observables. We theoretically derive the relation, revealing survival activity as the pivotal thermodynamic quantity governing the precision bound. The verification is demonstrated on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor, which is treated as a real thermodynamic system. To achieve accurate results despite substantial device errors, we introduce a generic protocol for measuring survival activity and employ circuit reduction techniques based on the relation's properties. This strategy allows us to empirically identify survival activity for the first time and confirm the derived relation. Furthermore, the quantum computer's versatility enables the implementation of optimal observables, leading to the saturation of the relation and demonstrating the sharpness of our bound on a physical device. The method's broad applicability is further illustrated by verifying the trade-off for quantum time correlators. Our findings establish quantum computers as effective platforms for investigating fundamental thermodynamic trade-off relations.</description>

      <title>Noisy atomic magnetometry with Kalman filtering and measurement-based feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing a magnetic field with an atomic magnetometer operated in real time presents significant challenges, primarily due to sensor non-linearity, the presence of noise, and the need for one-shot estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive approach that integrates measurement, estimation and control strategies. Specifically, this involves implementing a quantum non-demolition measurement based on continuous light-probing of the atomic ensemble. The resulting photocurrent is then directed into an Extended Kalman Filter to produce instantaneous estimates of the system's dynamical parameters. These estimates, in turn, are utilised by a Linear Quadratic Regulator, whose output is applied back to the system through a feedback loop. This procedure automatically steers the atomic ensemble into a spin-squeezed state, yielding a quantum enhancement in precision. Furthermore, thanks to the feedback proposed, the atoms exhibit entanglement even when the measurement data is discarded. To prove that our approach constitutes the optimal strategy in realistic scenarios, we derive ultimate bounds on the estimation error applicable in the presence of both local and collective decoherence, and show that these are indeed attained. Additionally, we demonstrate that for large ensembles the EKF not only reliably predicts its own estimation error in real time, but also accurately estimates spin-squeezing at short timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have been widely applied in various domains, demonstrating the potential advantages of quantum circuits over classical models. Similar to classic models, VQCs can be optimized by various gradient-based methods. However, the optimization may get stuck in barren plateaus initially or trapped in saddle points during training. These gradient-related issues can severely impact the trainability of VQCs. In this work, we propose a strategy that regularizes model parameters with prior knowledge of the training data and Gaussian noise diffusion. We conduct ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our strategy across four public datasets and demonstrate that our method can improve the trainability of VQCs against the above-mentioned gradient issues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond-based quantum sensors have enabled high-resolution NMR spectroscopy at the microscale in scenarios where fast molecular motion averages out dipolar interactions among target nuclei. However, in samples with low-diffusion, ubiquitous dipolar couplings challenge the extraction of relevant spectroscopic information. In this work we present a protocol that enables the scanning of nuclear spins in dipolarly-coupled samples at high magnetic fields with a sensor based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) ensembles. Our protocol is based on the synchronized delivery of radio frequency (RF) and microwave (MW) radiation to eliminate couplings among nuclei in the scanned sample and to efficiently extract target energy-shifts from the sample's magnetization dynamics. In addition, the method is designed to operate at high magnetic fields leading to a larger sample thermal polarization, thus to an increased NMR signal. The precision of our method is ultimately limited by the coherence time of the sample, allowing for accurate identification of relevant energy shifts in solid-state systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing the well-known spin-squeezing inequalities, we study the relation between squeezing of collective $N$-particle $su(d)$ operators and many-body entanglement geometry in multi-particle systems. For that aim, we define the set of pseudo-separable states, which are mixtures of products of single-particle states that lie in the $(d^2-1)$-dimensional Bloch sphere but are not necessarily positive semidefinite. We obtain a set of necessary conditions for states of $N$ qudits to be of the above form. Any state that violates these conditions is entangled. We also define a corresponding $su(d)$-squeezing parameter that can be used to detect entanglement in large particle ensembles. Geometrically, this set of conditions defines a convex set of points in the space of first and second moments of the collective $N$-particle $su(d)$ operators. We prove that, in the limit $N\gg 1$, such set is filled by pseudo-separable states, while any state corresponding to a point outside of this set is necessarily entangled. We also study states that are detected by these inequalities: We show that states with a bosonic symmetry are detected if and only if the two-body reduced state violates the positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion. On the other hand, highly mixed states states close to the $su(d)$ singlet are detected which have a separable two-body reduced state and are also PPT with respect to all possible bipartitions. We also provide numerical examples of thermal equilibrium states that are detected by our set of inequalities, comparing the spin-squeezing inequalities with the $su(3)$-squeezing inequalities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Nanoelectronics: Fisher Information for an Applied Perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems used for metrology can offer enhanced precision over their classical counterparts. The design of quantum sensors can be optimized by maximizing the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which characterizes the precision of parameter estimation for an ideal measurement. Here we consider the response of a quantum system as a means to estimate the strength of a weak external perturbation. General expressions for the QFI in the nonequilibrium steady-state are derived, which hold for arbitrary interacting many-body systems at finite or zero temperature, and can be related to susceptibilities or linear-response transport coefficients. For quantum dot nanoelectronics devices, we show that electron interactions can lead to *exponential* scaling of the QFI with system size, highlighting that quantum resources can be utilized in the full Fock space. The precision estimation of voltages and fields can also be achieved by practical measurements. In particular, we show that current-based metrology in quantum circuits can leverage many-body effects for enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Characterization and generation of a SQL-beating cat-like state through repetitive measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensitivity in metrology without entanglement is limited by standard quantum limit (SQL). Recent studies have found that the Heisenberg-limited scaling -- ultimate sensitivity in quantum metrology -- can be achieved by generalized cat states, characterized by an index that indicates coherence among macroscopically distinct states. Although generalized cat states include diverse states, encompassing classical mixtures of exponentially large numbers of states, the preparation of large generalized cat states has not been demonstrated yet. Here, we characterize SQL-beating cat-like states using the index $q$ indicating macroscopic coherence and prove that any state with $q&gt;1.5$ has a potential to surpass the SQL when used as a sensor. We then propose a protocol to generate them through repetitive measurements on a quantum spin system of $N$ spins, which we call a spin ensemble. Starting from a thermal equilibrium state of the spin ensemble, we demonstrate that we can increase the coherence among the spin ensemble via repetitive weak measurements of its total magnetization, which is indirectly measured through an ancillary qubit collectively coupled to the ensemble. Notably, our method for creating the SQL-beating cat-like states requires no dynamical control over the spin ensemble. As a potential experimental realization, we discuss a hybrid system composed of a superconducting flux qubit and donor spins in silicon. Our results pave the way for the realization of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology in state-of-the-art technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16047v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-stabilizerness resource theory for operators, which is dual to that describing states. We identify that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. Operationally, this measure quantifies how well an operator can be approximated by one with only a few Pauli strings -- analogous to how entanglement entropy relates to tensor-network truncation. A notable advantage of operator stabilizer entropies is their inherent locality, as captured by a Lieb-Robinson bound. This feature makes them particularly suited for studying local dynamical magic resource generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that under random evolution, operator magic typically reaches near-maximal value for all R\'enyi indices, and we evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we solve the operator stabilizer entropy for interacting integrable XXZ circuit, finding that it quickly saturates to a constant value. Overall, this measure sheds light on the structural properties of many-body non-stabilizerness generation and can inspire Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering the emerging applications of quantum technologies, studying energy storage and usage at the quantum level is of great interest. In this context, there is a significant contemporary interest in studying ergotropy, the maximum amount of work that can be extracted unitarily from an energy-storing quantum device. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a feedback-based algorithm (FQErgo) for estimating ergotropy. This method also transforms an arbitrary initial state to its passive state, which allows no further unitary work extraction. FQErgo applies drive fields whose strengths are iteratively adjusted via certain expectation values, conveniently read using a single probe qubit. Thus, FQErgo provides a practical way for unitary energy extraction and for preparing passive states. By numerically analyzing FQErgo on random initial states, we confirm the successful preparation of passive states and estimation of ergotropy, even in the presence of drive errors. Finally, we implement FQErgo on two- and three-qubit NMR registers, prepare their passive states, and accurately estimate their ergotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization plays a crucial role in many industrial applications. While classical computing often struggles with complex instances, quantum optimization emerges as a promising alternative. Here, we present an enhanced bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm to address higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO). We apply BF-DCQO to a HUBO problem featuring three-local terms in the Ising spin-glass model, validated experimentally using 156 qubits on an IBM quantum processor. In the studied instances, our results outperform standard methods such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, quantum annealing, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of a similar HUBO problem on a 433-qubit Osprey-like quantum processor. Finally, we solve denser instances of the MAX 3-SAT problem in an IonQ emulator. Our results show that BF-DCQO offers an effective path for solving large-scale HUBO problems on current and near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>GAN decoder on a quantum toric code for noise-robust quantum teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based decoder for quantum topological codes and apply it to enhance a quantum teleportation protocol under depolarizing noise. By constructing and training the GAN's generator and discriminator networks using eigenvalue datasets from the code, we obtain a decoder with a significantly improved decoding pseudo-threshold. Simulation results show that our GAN decoder achieves a pseudo-threshold of approximately $p=0.2108$, estimated from the crossing point of logical error rate curves for code distances $d=3$ and $d=5$, nearly double that of a classical decoder under the same conditions ($p \approx 0.1099$). Moreover, at the same target logical error rate, the GAN decoder consistently achieves higher logical fidelity compared to the classical decoder. When applied to quantum teleportation, the protocol optimized using our decoder demonstrates enhanced fidelity across noise regimes. Specifically, for code distance $d=3$, fidelity improves within the depolarizing noise threshold range $P&lt;0.06503$; for $d=5$, the range extends to $P&lt;0.07512$. Moreover, with appropriate training, our GAN decoder can generalize to other error models. This work positions GANs as powerful tools for decoding in topological quantum error correction, offering a flexible and noise-resilient framework for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We propose the use of collective states of matter as a resource for the deterministic generation of quantum states of light, which are fundamental for quantum information technologies. Our minimal model consists of three emitters coupled to a half-waveguide, i.e., a one-dimensional waveguide terminated by a mirror. Photon-mediated interactions between the emitters result in the emergence of bright and dark states. The dark states form a decoherence-free subspace, protected from dissipation. Local driving of the emitters and control of their resonance frequencies allows to perform arbitrary quantum gates within the decoherence-free subspace. Coupling to bright states facilitates photon emission, thereby enabling the realization of quantum gates between light and matter. We demonstrate that sequential application of these gates leads to the generation of photonic entangled states, such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and one- and two-dimensional cluster states.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the superposition of coherent states, emphasizing quantum states with distinct Wigner phase-space features relevant to quantum information applications. In this study, we introduce generalized versions of the compass state, which display enhanced phase-space characteristics compared with the conventional compass state, typically a superposition of four coherent states. Our findings reveal that, unlike sub-Planckian structures and phase-space sensitivity of the compass state, these generalized states produce isotropic sub-Planckian structures and sensitivity to phase-space displacements. We demonstrate that these desirable phase-space characteristics are maintained in superpositions comprising at least six distinct coherent states. Furthermore, we show that increasing the number of coherent states in the superposition preserves these characteristics, provided the number remains even. We examine an optomechanical system capable of generating the proposed quantum states, resulting in optomechanical counterparts with nearly identical phase-space structures, thereby suggesting the feasibility of physically realizing these generalized compass states.</description>

      <title>Probing Entanglement Scaling Across a Quantum Phase Transition on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter is difficult due to the curse of dimensionality and intricate entanglement structures. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions, where quantum fluctuations manifest across all length scales. While quantum simulators give controlled access to a number of strongly correlated systems, the study of critical phenomena has been hampered by finite-size effects arising from diverging correlation lengths. Moreover, the experimental investigation of entanglement in many-body systems has been hindered by limitations in measurement protocols. To address these challenges, we employ the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and implement a holographic scheme for subsystem tomography on a fully-connected trapped-ion quantum computer. Our method accurately represents infinite systems and long-range correlations with few qubits, facilitating the efficient extraction of observables and entanglement properties, even at criticality. We observe a quantum phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking and reveal the evolution of entanglement properties across the critical point. For the first time, we demonstrate log-law scaling of subsystem entanglement entropies at criticality on a digital quantum computer. This achievement highlights the potential of MERA for the investigation of strongly-correlated many-body systems on quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We present fast parallel rearrangement of single atoms in optical tweezers into arbitrary geometries by updating holograms displayed by an ultra fast spatial light modulator. Using linear interpolation of the tweezer position and the optical phase between the start and end arrays, we can calculate and display holograms every few ms, limited by technology. To show the versatility of our method, we sort the same atomic sample into multiple geometries with success probabilities of 0.996(2) per rearrangement cycle. This makes the method a useful tool for rearranging large atom arrays for quantum computation and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05937v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: The nodes are traditionally viewed as fixed points where the probability density vanishes. However, this work demonstrates that these nodes exhibit time-dependent oscillation in quantum superposition states. We derive this effect for a fundamental system: the 1D particle in a box. It is shown that the probability density in a superposition of two eigenstates evolves with a time-dependent interference term, introducing an oscillation of the nodes at a specific frequency equal to the energy difference between the states. This result suggests a deeper dynamical role for nodes in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between the Number of Nodes in Wave Functions and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</title>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the complex relationship between Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and the nodal structure of wave functions in a variety of quantum systems including the quantum harmonic oscillator, the particle in a 1D box , and the particle on a ring. We argue that the uncertainty in conjugate variables, like location and momentum, is generally a function of the number of nodes. As our investigation reveals, the nature of this influence depends on the system. This paper demonstrates that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is influenced by the nodal structure of wave functions and how the nature of this dependence is system-dependent.</description>

Abstract: We study an optomechanical system, where a mechanical oscillator interacts with a Gaussian input optical field. In the linearized picture, we analytically prove that if the input light field is the vacuum state, or is frequency-independently squeezed, the stationary entanglement between the oscillator and the output optical field is independent of the coherent coupling between them, which we refer to as the universality of entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that entanglement cannot be generated by performing arbitrary frequency-dependent squeezing on the input optical field. Our results hold in the presence of general, Gaussian environmental noise sources, including non-Markovian noise.</description>

Abstract: Optomechanical systems subjected to environmental noise give rise to rich physical phenomena. We investigate entanglement between a mechanical oscillator and the reflected coherent optical field in a general, not necessarily Markovian environment. For the input optical field, we consider stationary Gaussian states and frequency dependent squeezing. We demonstrate that for a coherent laser drive, either unsqueezed or squeezed in a frequency-independent manner, optomechanical entanglement is destroyed after a threshold that depends only on the environmental noises -- independent of the coherent coupling between the oscillator and the optical field, or the squeeze factor. In this way, we have found a universal entangling-disentangling transition. We also show that for a configuration in which the oscillator and the reflected field are separable, entanglement cannot be generated by incorporating frequency-dependent squeezing in the optical field.</description>

      <title>Approximate Dynamical Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a critical role in enabling fault-tolerant quantum computing by protecting fragile quantum information from noise. While general-purpose quantum error correction codes are designed to address a wide range of noise types, they often require substantial resources, making them impractical for near-term quantum devices. Approximate quantum error correction provides an alternative by tailoring codes to specific noise environments, reducing resource demands while still maintaining noise-robustness. Dynamical codes, including Floquet codes, introduce a dynamic approach to quantum error correction, employing time-dependent operations to stabilize logical qubits. In this work, we combine the flexibility of dynamical codes with the versatility of approximate quantum error correction to offer a promising avenue for addressing dominant noise in quantum systems. We construct several approximate dynamical codes using the recently developed strategic code framework. As a special case, we recover the approximate static codes widely studied in the existing literature. By analyzing these approximate dynamical codes through semidefinite programming, we establish the uniqueness and robustness of the optimal encoding, decoding, and check measurements. We also develop a temporal Petz recovery map suited to approximate dynamical codes.</description>

Abstract: Hidden-variable theories effectively solve the measurement problem. However, a serious issue of this route towards a realistic completion of quantum theory is raised by Bell's proof that the resulting theories are nonlocal. A possible resolution is to reject the assumption that measurements have single actual outcomes. Indeed, relaxing this premise, Deutsch and Hayden showed that Bell's theorem can be evaded by delaying the buildup of the correlations until the parties compare their outcomes at a meeting point. However, the Deutsch-Hayden theory, which is deterministic and psi-ontic, leads to an infinite information flow towards the meeting point. Furthermore, alternative branches are weighted by amplitudes, leading to interpretative issues. In this paper, we introduce a general framework that combines the randomness of single-world theories with the coexistence of diverse instances, as found in many-worlds theory. This framework incorporates the existing theories as limiting cases. We explore how this hybrid approach addresses key challenges of single-world and Deutsch-Hayden theories. On one hand, the multiplicity of coexisting instances allows us to circumvent nonlocality and, possibly, contextuality. On the other hand, randomness makes it possible to derive quantum probabilities from unweighted counts of instances and ensemble averages. Furthermore, it can lead to a reduction of the information flow. We illustrate this framework with a local model for two spatially separate maximally entangled qubits. The model requires two unweighted instances and a finite information flow -- just one bit per measurement is communicated to the meeting point. Setting aside its foundational motivations, this framework has also relevance in quantum communication complexity and leads to novel technical questions, potentially providing new insights into some peculiarities of entanglement.</description>

Abstract: The generalized uncertainty connection between the fluctuations of a quantum observable and its temporal derivative is derived in this study, we demonstrate that the product of an observable's uncertainties and its time derivative is bounded by half the modulus of the expectation value of the commutator between the observable and its derivative, using the Cauchy Schwarz inequality and the standard definitions of operator variances. In order to connect the dynamical evolution of observables to their inherent uncertainties, we reformulate the bound in terms of a double commutator by expressing the derivative in terms of the Hamiltonian via the Heisenberg equation of motion. Next, we apply this generalized relation to a spin particle to demonstrate its usefulness in a magnetic field that changes over time, and expand the study to include observables that have a clear temporal dependence. Our findings provide greater understanding of quantum dynamics and the influence of time-dependent interactions on measurement precision in addition to recovering the traditional uncertainty relations for static systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error correction is generally demanded in large-scale quantum information processing and quantum computation. We provide here a universal and realtime control strategy to dynamically correct the arbitrary type of errors in the system Hamiltonian. It yields multiple error-resilient paths for the interested system which are activated by the von Neumann equation for ancillary projection operators. With no extra control fields and precise designs, the path-dependent global phase alone suffices to mitigate the error-induced transitions among distinct paths as long as it varies faster than the other parameters. The corrected paths can also be regarded as the approximate solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation perturbed by errors. Our dynamical-correction strategy is practiced with the cyclic transfer of populations in a three-level system, showing a superior error resilience to the parallel-transport condition. It provides a promising idea for advancing control methodologies in imprecise quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of the Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) optimizer in the presence of noise. Specifically, we evaluate the efficacy of QNG within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for finding the ground state of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM). Its performance is benchmarked against the Vanilla Gradient Descent optimizer across two prominent quantum computing platforms: Rydberg atoms and superconducting circuits. Our analysis includes simulations under both idealized noise-free conditions and realistic noisy environments based on calibration data from actual devices. Results demonstrate that QNG consistently outperforms Vanilla Gradient Descent, exhibiting faster convergence on average and greater robustness against random initializations of parameters. This robustness is attributed to the distance regularization in parameter space inherent to QNG. Additionally, QNG achieves a higher convergence rate to the solution, effectively avoiding certain local minima. These findings highlight QNG as a promising tool for optimizing variational quantum algorithms in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) and an extended protocol known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) have emerged as promising algorithms to solve the electronic Schr\"odinger equation with noisy quantum computers. In QSCI/SQD a quantum circuit is repeatedly prepared on the quantum device, and measured configurations form a subspace of the many-body Hilbert space in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized classically. For the dissociation of N$_2$ and a model $\mathrm{[2Fe-2S]}$ cluster (correlating 10 electrons in 26 orbitals and 30 electrons in 20 orbitals, respectively) we show that a non-perturbative stochastic approach, phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), using truncated SQD trial wavefunctions obtained from quantum hardware can recover a substantial amount (e.g., O(100) mHa) of correlation energy and alleviate the possible sampling redundancy of the QSCI/SQD procedure. Extrapolation of the ph-AFQMC energy versus the energy variance of the SQD trial wavefunctions has the potential to further improve the energy accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>

Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Parameter Estimation for Detectors in Constantly Accelerated Motion</title>

Abstract: We analyze quantum parameter estimation by studying the dynamics of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for two classes of parameters, acceleration and initial-state weight, in an Unruh-DeWitt detector undergoing four distinct noninertial motions: linear, cusped, catenary, and circular trajectories respectively. We assume that the detector is initialized in a pure superposition state with a weight parameter $\theta$ characterizing the probability of the detector occupying each state. Our results reveal that, over long evolution times, the QFI for the acceleration parameter converges to a nonnegative asymptotic value that depends sensitively on the trajectory, whereas the QFI for the weight parameter decays to zero as the system thermalizes. Importantly, for sufficiently large accelerations, one can attain the optimal precision in estimating the acceleration parameter within a finite interaction time, eliminating the need for infinitely long measurements. Comparing trajectories, we find that for small accelerations (relative to the detector's energy gap), linear motion yields the highest QFI for $\theta$, while for large accelerations, circular motion becomes optimal for estimating $\theta$. By contrast, circular motion offers the best precision for estimating acceleration itself in both the small- and large-acceleration regimes (the latter only at very long times). These contrasting behaviors of QFI across trajectories suggest a novel metrological protocol for inferring the underlying noninertial motion of a quantum probe.</description>

      <title>Symmetric channel verification for purifying noisy quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry inherent in quantum states has been widely used to reduce the effect of noise in quantum error correction and a quantum error mitigation technique known as symmetry verification. However, these symmetry-based techniques exploit symmetry in quantum states rather than quantum channels, limiting their application to cases where the entire circuit shares the same symmetry. In this work, we propose symmetric channel verification (SCV), a channel purification protocol that leverages the symmetry inherent in quantum channels. By introducing different phases to each symmetric subspace and employing a quantum phase estimation-like circuit, SCV can detect and correct symmetry-breaking noise in quantum channels. We further propose a hardware-efficient implementation of SCV at the virtual level, which requires only a single-qubit ancilla and is robust against the noise in the ancilla qubit. Our protocol is applied to various Hamiltonian simulation circuits and phase estimation circuits, resulting in a significant reduction of errors. Furthermore, in setups where only Clifford unitaries can be used for noise purification, which is relevant in the early fault-tolerant regime, we show that SCV under Pauli symmetry represents the optimal purification method.</description>

      <title>Refined Criteria for QRAM Error Suppression via Efficient Large-Scale QRAM Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a critical primitive for quantum algorithms that require data lookup in superposition, but its lack of fault tolerance poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. Error filtration (EF) has been proposed as a hardware-efficient alternative to error correction, capable of suppressing incoherent noise without encoding overhead. However, its performance in realistic QRAM systems with moderate fidelity has remained unclear, as existing analyses rely on asymptotic approximations and numerical simulations have been limited to small sizes. We address this gap using a new simulator for bucket-brigade (BB) QRAM that combines sparse state encoding with a noise-aware pruning algorithm. This framework provides full quantum state access and scales efficiently, enabling us to probe EF performance in size and noise regimes far beyond previous studies. Our simulations reveal suppression anomalies at high noise levels or large address sizes, where post-selection probability fundamentally constrains EF scaling. Incorporating this effect, we refine EF theory into near-deterministic criteria linking base infidelity to achievable suppression, thereby delineating the regime in which EF yields progressive improvement. Beyond refining EF, we quantitatively characterize the runtime and memory costs of our noisy BB QRAM simulator, achieving simulations of systems with 20 layers using less than 1 GB of memory. This efficiency is what enables us to probe parameter regimes beyond previous work and to establish the simulator as a practical, ``fine-print'' analysis tool for assessing QRAM as a quantum resource.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenstate filters underpin near-optimal quantum algorithms for ground state preparation. Their realization on current quantum computers, however, poses a challenge as the filters are typically represented by deep quantum circuits. Additionally, since the filters are created probabilistically, their circuits need to be rerun many times when the associated success probability is small. Here we describe a strategy to implement a ground-state filter on quantum hardware in the presence of noise by prepending the filter with digitized adiabatic quantum computing. The adiabatically prepared input state increases the success probability of the filter and also reduces its circuit depth requirements. At the same time, the filter enhances the accuracy of the adiabatically prepared ground state. We compare the approach to the purely adiabatic protocol through numerical simulations and experiments on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. We demonstrate a significant improvement in ground-state accuracies for paradigmatic quantum spin models.</description>

Abstract: Solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine material host for electron qubits. Single electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have shown extraordinarily long coherence times and high operation fidelities. Realizing two-qubit gates in this platform is the next major step for practical quantum information processing. In this work, we demonstrate frequency- and time-domain coherent manipulation of multiple eNe charge qubits that are coupled by charge-charge interactions. Cross-resonance and bSWAP two-qubit gates are implemented, laying the foundation for universal quantum computing. Inter-qubit coupling strength exceeding 60~MHz is observed, promising fast and high-fidelity two-qubit gates. These results highlight the potential to develop the eNe qubit platform into a compelling quantum computing architecture.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Landau-Zener formula via functional equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau-Zener formula describes the diabatic transition probability of a two-level system under linear driving. Its rigorous derivation typically relies on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the Landau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach via functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This derivation is rigorous and does not involve any sophisticated mathematics. Our work provides insights into the origin of the exponential form of the Landau-Zener transition probability, and shows that the Landau-Zener formula can be viewed as a consequence of integrability, though the two-level Landau-Zener Hamiltonian itself does not satisfy the integrability conditions.</description>

Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of quantum cryptography, Device-independent Quantum Key Distribution (DI-QKD) stands out for its unique approach to ensuring security based not on the trustworthiness of the devices but on nonlocal correlations. Beginning with a contextual understanding of modern cryptographic security and the limitations of standard quantum key distribution methods, this review explores the pivotal role of nonclassicality and the challenges posed by various experimental loopholes for DI-QKD. Various protocols, security against individual, collective and coherent attacks, and the concept of self-testing are also examined, as well as the entropy accumulation theorem, and additional mathematical methods in formulating advanced security proofs. In addition, the burgeoning field of semi-device-independent models (measurement DI--QKD, Receiver DI--QKD, and One--sided DI--QKD) is also analyzed. The practical aspects are discussed through a detailed overview of experimental progress and the open challenges toward the commercial deployment in the future of secure communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show how random fluctuations in the magnetic field will jitter the paths of a matter-wave interferometer randomly, hence, decohere the quantum superposition. To create a large spatial superposition with nanoparticles, we envisage embedding a spin in a nanoparticle as a defect and applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field as in a Stern-Gerlach type experiment to create a macroscopic quantum superposition. Such matter-wave interferometers are the cornerstone for many new fundamental advancements in physics; particularly, adjacent matter-wave interferometers can use entanglement features to test physics beyond the Standard Model, test the equivalence principle, improve quantum sensors, and test the quantum nature of spacetime in a lab. In particular, we will use white and flicker noise to study the decoherence and constrain the parameters keeping in mind ambient temperatures suitable for superconducting wires embedded on a chip. We will show that to obtain a tiny spatial superposition of a nanometer separation, $\Delta x \sim {\cal O} (10^{-9})$m and to minimize decoherence, $\Gamma\leq {\cal O}(\frac{\omega_0}{2\pi})$, where $\Gamma$ is the decoherence and $\omega_0$ is the frequency of the oscillator, we will need current fluctuations to be $\delta I/I\leq {\cal O}(10^{-8})$, which is not impossible to obtain in superconducting wire arrangements. For such tiny fluctuations, we demonstrate that the Humpty-Dumpty problem in a matter-wave interferometer arising from a mismatch in position and momentum does not cause a loss in contrast.</description>

      <title>Factorization of multimeters: a unified view on nonclassical quantum phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory exhibits various nonclassical features, such as measurement incompatibility, contextuality, steering, and Bell nonlocality, which distinguish it from classical physics. These phenomena are often studied separately, but they possess deep interconnections. This work introduces a unified mathematical framework based on commuting diagrams that unifies them. By representing collections of measurements (multimeters) as maps to the set of column-stochastic matrices, we show that measurement compatibility and simulability correspond to specific factorizations of these maps through intermediate systems. We apply this framework to put forward connections between different nonclassical notions and provide factorization-based characterizations for steering assemblages and Bell correlations, including a new perspective on the CHSH inequality witnessing measurement incompatibility. We also investigate the symmetric $n$-extensions of multimeters and no-signaling behaviors and connect these extensions to a notion of $n$-wise compatibility and to the existence of $n$-wise LHV models, respectively. Furthermore, we investigate robustness to noise of nonlocal features by examining factorization conditions for maps involving noisy state spaces, providing geometric criteria for when noisy multimeters can be simulated by simpler measurement settings.</description>

      <title>HMAE: Self-Supervised Few-Shot Learning for Quantum Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning for spin and molecular systems faces critical challenges of scarce labeled data and computationally expensive simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p &lt; 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their seminal paper, Einstein Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) had introduced a momentum entangled state for two particles. That state, referred to as the EPR state, has been widely used in studies on entangled particles with continuous degrees of freedom. Later that state was generalized to a form that allows varying degree of entanglement, known as the generalized EPR state. In a suitable limit it reduces to the EPR state. The generalized EPR state is theoretically analyzed here and its entanglement quantified in terms of a recently introduced generalized entanglement measure. This state can also be applied to entangled photons produced from spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). The present analysis is then used in quantifying the entanglement of photons produced from the SPDC process, in terms of certain experimental parameters. A comparison is also made with the Schmidt number, which is normally used as an entanglement measure in such situations. A procedure for experimentally determining the entanglement of SPDC photons has also been described. Furthermore, an additional state exhibiting non-Gaussian entanglement has been examined, and its entanglement has been quantified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a three-qubit quantum state tomography scheme requiring a set of 17 measurement settings, significantly reducing the experimental overhead compared to the conventional 63 Pauli measurement settings. Using IBM's 127-qubit open-access quantum processor ibm osaka, we prepare the three-qubit W state and employ our tomography scheme to reconstruct it. Additionally, we implement a two-qubit tomography protocol, involving 7 measurement settings, on ibm osaka to reconstruct two of the two-qubit marginals of the W state. This serves as a {\em proof-of-principle} demonstration of the well-known theoretical result that any two of the two-qubit reduced density matrices can uniquely determine most of the whole three-qubit pure states. We show that the fidelity of the W-state reconstructed from its two-qubit subsystems is consistently larger than that obtained from the full three-qubit tomography, highlighting the practical advantage of the subsystem-based tomography approach.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the purification rate are also obtained.</description>

Abstract: In this short-length paper, we will present some math that play a central role in quantum hydrodynamics and that were presented by Mita in the past. In this formulation of QM, a quantity is involved which is called the diffusion flux. As we will see, this quantity plays a crucial role on the evolution of wave packets. More specifically, we will initially briefly explain some results derived in Mita's papers, by analyzing Gaussian and soliton wave packets, while our main focus is on the role of diffusion in the evolution of super-luminal wave packets. Also, A very brief discussion will be made about the presence of the osmotic velocity field in quantum dynamics</description>

      <title>Robust quantum computational advantage with programmable 3050-photon Gaussian boson sampling</title>

Abstract: The creation of large-scale, high-fidelity quantum computers is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but also provides increasingly robust proofs of quantum computational advantage (QCA) in the presence of unavoidable noise and the dynamic competition with classical algorithm improvements. To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take &gt; $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\mu$s to produce a sample. This work establishes a new frontier of QCA and paves the way to fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing hardware.</description>

Abstract: Biphoton systems exhibiting entanglement in position-momentum variables, known as spatial entanglement, are among the most intriguing and well-studied phenomena in quantum optics. A notable subset of these are phase entangled states, where entanglement manifests purely through correlations in the spatial phase of the wavefunction. While the generation of such states from biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion has been explored, their physical implications and applications remain under-investigated. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally examine a unique form of phase entanglement known as `pure' phase entanglement. This state exhibits the unusual feature that the position of one photon is correlated with the momentum of the other. Unlike typical spatially entangled states, it shows no direct correlation in position or momentum between the two photons, underscoring that all correlations arise purely from the spatial phase of the wavefunction. We delve deeper into the theory of this state and experimentally construct it from known phase-entangled states. To certify its properties, we propose a setup that performs a "one-particle momentum measurement" and explore the various tunable parameters. We also highlight potential applications of this state in quantum optics and imaging experiments.</description>

Abstract: Simulating fermionic systems on qubit-based quantum computers often demands significant computational resources due to the requirement to map fermions to qubits. Thus, designing a fault-tolerant quantum computer that operates directly with fermions offers an effective solution to this challenge. Here, we introduce a protocol for fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computation utilizing fermion-to-fermion low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Our method employs a fermionic LDPC memory, which transfers its state to fermionic color code processors, where logical operations are subsequently performed. We propose using odd-weight logical Majorana operators to form the code space, serving as memory for the fermionic LDPC code, and provide an algorithm to identify these logical operators. We present examples showing that the coding rate of fermionic codes often matches that of qubit codes, while the logical error rate can be significantly lower than the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose two methods for performing fermionic lattice surgery to facilitate state transfer. Finally, we simulate the dynamics of a fermionic system using our protocol, illustrating effective error suppression.</description>

      <title>Trotter-based quantum algorithm for solving transport equations with exponentially fewer time-steps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extent to which quantum computers can simulate physical phenomena and solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern them remains a central open question. In this work, one of the most fundamental PDEs is addressed: the multidimensional transport equation with space- and time-dependent coefficients. We present a quantum numerical scheme based on three steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant observables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite difference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula approximations, also known as Trotterization. We introduce novel vector-norm analysis and prove that the number of time-steps can be reduced by a factor exponential in the number of qubits compared to previously established operator-norm analysis, thereby significantly lowering the projected computational resources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations that confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling. We report results on real quantum hardware for the one-dimensional convection equation, and solve a non-linear ordinary differential equation via its associated Liouville equation, a particular case of transport equations. This work provides a practical framework for efficiently simulating transport phenomena on quantum computers, with potential applications in plasma physics, molecular gas dynamics and non-linear dynamical systems, including chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity in quantum field theory, and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in various models of quantum field theory: free massive bosons and fermions on flat space and on spheres, holographic models, and lattice models with the UV-cutoff. In certain cases we find asymptotic behavior of Lanczos coefficients, which goes beyond previously observed universality. We confirm that in all cases the exponential growth of Krylov complexity satisfies the conjectural inequality, which generalizes the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. We discuss temperature dependence of Lanczos coefficients and note that the relation between the growth of Lanczos coefficients and chaos may only hold for the sufficiently late, truly asymptotic regime governed by the physics at the UV cutoff. Contrary to previous suggestions, we show scenarios when Krylov complexity in quantum field theory behaves qualitatively differently from the holographic complexity.</description>

      <title>Negative Spin $\Delta_T$ noise Induced by Spin-Flip Scattering and Andreev Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14072v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study charge $\Delta_T$ noise, followed by an examination of spin $\Delta_T$ noise, in the normal metal-spin flipper-normal metal-insulator-superconductor (N-sf-N-I-S) junction. Our analysis reveals a key contrast: while charge $\Delta_T$ noise remains strictly positive, spin $\Delta_T$ noise undergoes a sign reversal from positive to negative, driven by the interplay between spin-flip scattering as well as Andreev reflection. In contrast, charge quantum shot noise remains positive and sign-definite, which is valid for spin quantum shot noise also. The emergence of negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise has two major implications. First, it establishes a clear distinction between spin resolved $\Delta_T$ noise and quantum shot noise: the former is dominated by opposite-spin correlations, whereas the latter is led by same-spin correlations. Second, it provides access to scattering mechanisms that are not captured by quantum shot noise alone. Thus, negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise serves as a unique probe of the cooperative effects of Andreev reflection and spin flipping. We further place our results in context by comparing them with earlier reports of negative $\Delta_T$ noise in strongly correlated systems, such as fractional quantum Hall states, and in multiterminal hybrid superconducting junctions. Overall, this work offers new insights into the mechanisms governing sign reversals in $\Delta_T$ noise and highlights their role as distinctive fingerprints of spin-dependent scattering in superconducting hybrid devices.</description>

Abstract: We formulate quantum computing solutions to a large class of dynamic nonlinear asset pricing models using algorithms, in theory exponentially more efficient than classical ones, which leverage the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement. The equilibrium asset pricing solution is a quantum state. We introduce quantum decision-theoretic foundations of ambiguity and model/parameter uncertainty to deal with model selection.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing quantum-spin systems on a two-dimensional square lattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by Floquet engineering using Rydberg atoms</title>

Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators for quantum impurity problems after a quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An emergent numerical approach to solve quantum impurity problems is to encode the impurity path integral as a matrix product state. For time-dependent problems, the cost of this approach generally scales with the evolution time. Here we consider a common non-equilibrium scenario where an impurity, initially in equilibrium with a thermal bath, is driven out of equilibrium by a sudden quench of the impurity Hamiltonian. Despite that there is no time-translational invariance in the problem, we show that we could still make full use of the infinite matrix product state technique, resulting in a method whose cost is essentially independent of the evolution time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in the integrable case against exact diagonalization, and against existing calculations on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour in the general case. Our method could be a very competitive method for studying long-time non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and be potentially used as an efficient impurity solver in the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory.</description>

      <title>Topological Amplification of the Bosonic Kitaev Chain with Non-Uniform Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bosonic Kitaev chain is known to have extraordinary properties distinct from its fermionic counterpart. For example, it exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect -- its eigenmodes are exponentially localized to the edges of the chain -- even when the system is Hermitian. Such non-Hermitian effects originate from the fact that the dynamics of bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians is governed by a non-Hermitian matrix. In the topological phase of the model, the modes conspire to lead to phase-dependent and directional exponential amplification of a classical drive. In this work, we study the robustness of this topological amplification to on-site dissipations. We examine the effect of uniform and non-uniform losses under various configurations. We find a remarkable resilience to dissipation in some configurations, while in others the dissipation causes a topological phase transition which eliminates the exponential amplification. In particular, when the dissipation is placed on every other site, the system remains topological and the exponential amplification persists even for very large loss rates which exceed the system's non-Hermitian gap. On the other hand, we find that dividing the chain into unit cells of an odd number of sites and placing dissipation on the first site leads to a topological phase transition at a certain critical value of the dissipation. Our work thus provides insights into the robustness against losses of the topological amplification of non-Hermitian systems and sets explicit limits on the bosonic Kitaev chain's ability to act as a multimode quantum sensor in realistic lossy scenarios.</description>

Abstract: For a diagonalizable linear operator $H:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ acting in a separable Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, i.e., an operator with a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of eigenvectors that form a Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$, the pseudo-Hermiticity of $H$ is equivalent to its generalized parity-time-reversal ($PT$) symmetry, where the latter means the existence of an antilinear operator $X:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $[X,H]=0$ and $X^2=1$. {The original proof of this result makes use of the anti-pesudo-Hermiticity of every diagonalizable operator $L:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$, which means the existence of an antilinear Hermitian bijection $\tau:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $L^\dagger=\tau L\,\tau^{-1}$. We establish the validity of this result for block-diagonalizable operators}, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$. {This allows us to generalize the original proof of the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry for diagonalizable operators to block-diagonalizable operators. For a pair of pseudo-Hermitian operators acting respectively in two-dimensional and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we obtain explicit expressions for the antlinear operators $\tau$ and $X$ that realize their anti-pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry at and away from the exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: We characterize covariant positive decomposable maps between unital C*-algebras in terms of a dilation theorem, which generalizes a seminal result by H. Scutaru from Rep. Math. Phys. 16 (1):79-87, 1979. As a case study, we provide a certain characterization of the operator sum representation of maps on $\mathbb{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$, covariant with respect to the maximal commutative subgroup of $\mathrm{U}(n)$. A connection to quantum dynamics is established by specifying sufficient and necessary conditions for covariance of D-divisible (decomposably divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 (2023) 485202.</description>

      <title>Lattice Quantum Geometry Controlling 118 K Multigap Superconductivity in Heavily Overdoped CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d</title>

Abstract: Synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been used to study the thermal structure evolution in CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d (Cu1234), a superconductor which exhibits a high critical temperature (Tc 118 K), high critical current density and large upper critical magnetic field. The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Physical Formalism Of Directional Quantum Evolution Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we introduce the Directional Quantum Evolution Theory (DQET), a covariant reformulation of quantum mechanics where evolution takes place along a four-vector-defined arbitrary timelike direction. This method restores space-time symmetry and provides a geometric interpretation of energy as a frame-dependent projection by substituting a directional derivative for the traditional time derivative. DQET establishes a conserved probability current, supports proper-time evolution, and recovers the Schrodinger in suitable bounds. It provides a covariant solution to the quantum twin conundrum and predicts observable phase discrepancies between systems traveling along distinct trajectories. With encouraging extensions to curved spacetime, the theory offers a cohesive framework for relativistic quantum evolution.</description>

      <title>Non-ergodic one-magnon magnetization dynamics of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</description>

      <title>Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem: generic quadratic open fermionic systems governed by Lindblad master equations do not host dissipation-free topological edge states protected by the dissipation gap. By analogy with topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindblad generator to a first-quantized non-Hermitian matrix representation that plays the role of a band Hamiltonian. Edge modes of this matrix with vanishing real part are exactly dissipation-free. We show that this matrix is always adiabatically deformable, through a symmetry-preserving path, to a topologically trivial Hermitian matrix. Hence no symmetry-protected, dissipation-free edge modes exist in quadratic open fermions. Our results apply to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians and require only a gapped bulk and a bounded spectrum. They establish a clear boundary for robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exploring null-entropy events: What do we learn when nothing happens?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish that thermodynamic processes at the microscale can occasionally result in negative entropy production. At the microscale, another distinct possibility becomes more likely: processes where no entropy is produced overall. In this work, we explore the constraints imposed by such null-entropy events on the fluctuations of thermodynamic currents. By incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation theorems. We validate this framework using an example of a qudit SWAP engine.</description>
