      <title>A phase transition in the Bakry-\'Emery gradient estimate for Dyson Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find a gap between the lower bound of the Bakry-\'Emery $N$-Ricci tensor ${\rm Ric}_N$ and the Bakry-\'Emery gradient estimate ${\sf BE}$ in the space associated with the finite-particle Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) with inverse temperature $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$. Namely, we prove that, for the weighted space $(\mathbb R^n, w_\beta)$ with $w_\beta=\prod_{i&lt;j}^n |x_i-x_j|^\beta$ and any $N\in[n+\frac{\beta}{2}n(n-1),+\infty]$,
  $\beta \ge 1 \implies {\rm Ric}_N \ge 0 \ \&amp; \ {\sf BE}(0,N)$ hold;
  $0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1 \implies {\rm Ric}_N \ge 0$ holds while ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ does not, which shows a phase transition of the Dyson Brownian motion regarding the Bakry-\'Emery curvature bound in the small inverse temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Universality of convergence rate of rightmost eigenvalue of complex IID random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries $x_{ij} \stackrel{\text { d }}{=} n^{-1 / 2} \xi$ with $\xi$ being a complex random variable of mean zero and variance one. Let $\{\sigma_i\}_{1\le i\le n}$ be the eigenvalues of $X,$ and $R_n:=\max_i \Re \sigma_i$ and $Z_n$ be some scaled version of $R_n.$ It was proved that $Z_n$ converges weakly to the Gumbel distribution $\Lambda$ under certain moment conditions on $\xi.$ We further prove that for a complex random matrix with i.i.d. entries
  $$\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{P}(Z_n \leq x)-e^{-e^{-x}}|=\frac{25\log \log n}{4e \log n}(1+o(1))$$
  and
  $$ W_1\left(\mathcal{L}(Z_n), \Lambda\right)=\frac{25\log \log n}{4\log n}(1+o(1))$$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $\mathcal{L}(Z_n)$ is the distribution of $Z_n$.</description>

      <title>Total progeny for spectrally negative branching L{\'e}vy processes with absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spectrally negative branching L{\'e}vy process in which particles are killed upon crossing below zero. It is known that such a process becomes extinct almost surely if the drift toward -$\infty$ is sufficiently strong to counterbalance the reproduction rate. In this note, we study the tail asymptotics of the number of particles absorbed at the boundary during the lifetime of the process, in both the subcritical and critical regimes.</description>

      <title>Finitary codings and stochastic domination for Poisson representable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construct a random set by independently selecting each finite subset of the integers with some probability depending on the set up to translations and taking the union of the selected sets. We show that when the only sets selected with positive probability are pairs, such a random set is a finitary factor of an IID process, answering a question of Forsstr\"om, Gantert and Steif. More generally, we show that this is the case whenever the distribution induced by the size of the selected sets has sufficient exponential moments, and that the existence of some exponential moment is necessary. We further show that such a random set is stochastically dominated by a non-trivial Bernoulli percolation if and only if there is a finite exponential moment, thereby partially answering another question of Forsstr\"om et al. We also give a partial answer to a third question regarding a form of phase transition. These results also hold on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d \ge 2$. In the one-dimensional case, under the condition that the distribution induced by the diameter of the selected sets has an exponential moment, we further show that such a random set is finitarily isomorphic to an IID process.</description>

      <title>Random dynamics and invariant measures for a class of non-Newtonian fluids of differential type on 2D and 3D Poincar\'e domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a class of incompressible stochastic third-grade fluids (non-Newtonian fluids) equations on two- as well as three-dimensional Poincar\'e domains $\mathcal{O}$ (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aims are to study the well-posedness and asymptotic analysis for the solutions of the underlying system. Firstly, we prove that the underlying system defined on $\mathcal{O}$ has a unique weak solution (in the analytic sense) under Dirichlet boundary condition and it also generates random dynamical system $\Psi$. Secondly, we consider the underlying system on bounded domains. Using the compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{L}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we prove the existence of a unique random attractor for the underlying system on bounded domains with external forcing in $\mathbb{H}^{-1}(\mathcal{O})+\mathbb{W}^{-1,\frac{4}{3}}(\mathcal{O})$. Thirdly, we consider the underlying system on unbounded Poincar\'e domains with external forcing in $\mathbb{L}^{2}(\mathcal{O})$ and show the existence of a unique random attractor. In order to obtain the existence of a unique random attractor on unbounded domains, due to the lack of compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{H}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we use the uniform-tail estimates method which helps us to demonstrate the asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$.
  Note that due to the presence of several nonlinear terms in the underlying system, we are not able to use the energy equality method to obtain the asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$ in unbounded domains, which makes the analysis of this work in unbounded domains more difficult and interesting. Finally, as a consequence of the existence of random attractors, we address the existence of invariant measures for underlying system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to three fundamental papers on Markov Decision Processes and on control with incomplete observations published by Albert Shiryaev approximately sixty years ago. One of these papers was coauthored with O.V. Viskov. We discuss some of the results and some of many rich ideas presented in these papers and survey some later developments. At the end we mention some recent studies of Albert Shiryaev on Kolmogorov's equations for jump Markov processes and on control of continuous-time jump Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions of Stochastic Volterra Equations in convex domains with general kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new weak existence results for $d$-dimensional Stochastic Volterra Equations (SVEs) with continuous coefficients and possibly singular one-dimensional non-convolution kernels. These results are obtained by introducing an approximation scheme and showing its convergence. A particular emphasis is made on the stochastic invariance of the solution in a closed convex set. To do so, we extend the notion of kernels that preserve nonnegativity introduced in \cite{Alfonsi23} to non-convolution kernels and show that, under suitable stochastic invariance property of a closed convex set by the corresponding Stochastic Differential Equation, there exists a weak solution of the SVE that stays in this convex set. We present a family of non-convolution kernels that satisfy our assumptions, including a non-convolution extension of the well-known fractional kernel. We apply our results to SVEs with square-root diffusion coefficients and non-convolution kernels, for which we prove the weak existence and uniqueness of a solution that stays within the nonnegative orthant. We derive a representation of the Laplace transform in terms of a non-convolution Riccati equation, for which we establish an existence result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new kind of free independence, called real infinitesimal freeness. We show that independent orthogonally invariant with infinitesimal laws are asymptotically real infinitesimally free. We introduce new cumulants, called real infinitesimal cumulants and show that real infinitesimal freeness is equivalent to vanishing of mixed cumulants. We prove the formula for cumulants with products as entries.</description>

      <title>Myopic non-intersection in a periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of Markov processes conditioned to avoid intersection over a moving time window of length T&gt;0, a setting we refer to as myopic non-intersection. In particular, we study a system of myopic non-intersecting Brownian motions subject to a periodic potential. Our focus lies in understanding the interplay between the confining effect of the potential and the repulsion induced by the non-intersection constraint. We show that, in the long time limit, and as both T and the strength of the potential become large, the model converges to a system of myopic non-intersecting random walks, which transitions between standard non-intersection dynamics and exclusion behavior. The main technical contribution of the paper is the introduction of an algorithm, based on a modification of the acceptance-rejection sampling scheme, that provides an explicit construction of myopically constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Rumors on evolving graphs through stationary times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rumor spreading in dynamic random graphs. Starting with a single informed vertex, the information flows until it reaches all the vertices of the graph (completion), according to the following process. At each step $k$, the information is propagated to neighbors of the informed vertices, in the $k$-th generated random graph. The way this information propagates from vertex to vertex at each step will depend on the ``protocol". We provide a method based on strong stationary times to study the completion time when the graphs are Markovian time dependent, using known results of the literature for independent graphs. The concept of strong stationary times is then extended to non-Markovian Dynamics using coupling from the past algorithms. This allows to extend results on completion times for non-Markov dynamics</description>

      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Analysis for Symbolic Computation: Root Isolation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce beyond-worst-case analysis into symbolic computation. This is an extensive field which almost entirely relies on worst-case bit complexity, and we start from a basic problem in the field: isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials. This is a fundamental problem in symbolic computation and it is arguably one of the most basic problems in computational mathematics. The problem has a long history decorated with numerous ingenious algorithms and furnishes an active area of research. However, most available results in literature either focus on worst-case analysis in the bit complexity model or simply provide experimental benchmarking without any theoretical justifications of the observed results. We aim to address the discrepancy between practical performance of root isolation algorithms and prescriptions of worst-case complexity theory: We develop a smoothed analysis framework for polynomials with integer coefficients to bridge this gap. We demonstrate (quasi-)linear (expected and smoothed) complexity bounds for Descartes algorithm, that is one most well know symbolic algorithms for isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials with integer coefficients. Our results explain the surprising efficiency of Descartes solver in comparison to sophisticated algorithms that have superior worst-case complexity. We also analyse the Sturm solver, ANewDsc a symbolic-numeric algorithm that combines Descartes with Newton operator, and a symbolic algorithm for sparse polynomials.</description>

      <title>Explicit Density Approximation for Neural Implicit Samplers Using a Bernstein-Based Convex Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL), have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i) continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii) convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q = p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections, defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density approximation.</description>

      <title>kTULA: A Langevin sampling algorithm with improved KL bounds under super-linear log-gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}&gt;0$, which significantly improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.</description>

      <title>Star decompositions via orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $k$-star decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into $k$-stars (i.e., $k$ edges with a common vertex). The paper studies the following problem: given $k \leq d/2$, does the random $d$-regular graph have a $k$-star decomposition (asymptotically almost surely, provided that the number of edges is divisible by $k$)? Delcourt, Greenhill, Isaev, Lidick\'y, and Postle proved the a.a.s. existence for every odd $k$ using earlier results regarding orientations satisfying certain degree conditions modulo $k$.
  In this paper we give a direct, self-contained proof that works for every $d$ and every $k&lt;d/2-1$. In fact, we prove stronger results. Let $s\geq 1$ denote the integer part of $d/(2k)$. We show that the random $d$-regular graph a.a.s. has a $k$-star decomposition such that the number of stars centered at each vertex is either $s$ or $s+1$. Moreover, if $k &lt; d/3$ or $k \leq d/2 - 2.6 \log d$, we can even prescribe the set of vertices with $s$ stars, as long as it is of the appropriate size.</description>

      <title>State Space Decomposition of Quantum Dynamical Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean evolution of an open quantum system in continuous time is described by a time continuous semigroup of quantum channels (completely positive and trace-preserving linear maps). Baumgartner and Narnhofer presented a general decomposition of the underlying Hilbert space into a sum of invariant subspaces, also called enclosures. We propose a new reading of this result, inspired by the work of Carbone and Pautrat. In addition, we apply this decomposition to a class of open quantum random walks and to quantum trajectories, where we study its uniqueness.</description>

      <title>A noise-induced transition in the Lorenz system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.12815v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic perturbation of the classical Lorenz system in the range of parameters for which the origin is the global attractor. We show that adding noise in the last component causes a transition from a unique to exactly two ergodic invariant measures. The bifurcation threshold depends on the strength of the noise: if the noise is weak, the only invariant measure is Gaussian, while strong enough noise causes the appearance of a second ergodic invariant measure.</description>

      <title>Conditional constrained and unconstrained quantization for probability distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and develop the concept of conditional quantization for Borel probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^k,$ considering both constrained and unconstrained frameworks. For each setting, we define the associated quantization errors, dimensions, and coefficients, and provide explicit computations for specific classes of probability distributions. A key result in the unconstrained case is that the union of all optimal sets of $ n$-means is dense in the support of the measure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in conditional constrained quantization, if the conditional set is contained within the union of the constraint family, then the lower and upper quantization dimensions, as well as the corresponding coefficients, remain unaffected by the conditional set for any Borel probability measure. In contrast, if the conditional set is not contained within this union, these properties may no longer hold, as illustrated through various examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the sublinear expectation structure under countable state space. To describe an interesting "nonlinear randomized" trial, based on a convex compact domain, we introduce a family of probability measures under countable state space. Corresponding the sublinear expectation operator introduced by S. Peng, we consider the related notation under countable state space. Within the countable state framework, the sublinear expectation can be explicitly calculated by a novel repeated summation formula, and some interesting examples are given. Furthermore, we establish Monotone convergence theorem, Fatou's lemma and Dominated convergence theorem of sublinear expectation. Afterwards, we consider the independence under each probability measure, upon which we establish the sublinear law of large numbers and obtain the maximal distribution under sublinear expectation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the number of edge crossings in a random graph drawing generated by projecting a random geometric graph on some compact convex set $W\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 3$, onto a plane. The positions of these crossings form the support of a point process. We show that if the expected number of crossings converges to a positive but finite value, this point process converges to a Poisson point process in the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance. We further show a multivariate central limit theorem between the number of crossings and a second variable called the stress that holds when the expected vertex degree in the random geometric graph converges to a positive finite value.</description>

      <title>Parameter dependent rough SDEs with applications to rough PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rough stochastic differential equations (rough SDEs), recently introduced by Friz, Hocquet and L\^e in arXiv:2106.10340, have emerged as a versatile tool to study "doubly" SDEs under partial conditioning (with motivation from pathwise filtering and control, volatility modelling in finance and mean-field stochastic dynamics with common noise ...). While the full dynamics may be highly non-Markovian, the conditional dynamics often are. In natural (and even linear) situations, the resulting stochastic PDEs can be beyond existing technology. The present work then tackles a key problem in this context, which is the well-posedness of regular solution to the rough Kolmogorov backward equation. To this end, we study parameter dependent rough SDEs in sense of $\mathscr{L}$-differentiability (as in Krylov, 2008). In companion works, we will show how this removes dimension-dependent regularity assumptions for well-posedness of the Zakai, Kushner-Stratonovich and nonlinear Fokker-Planck stochastic equations.</description>

      <title>The continuous-time limit of quasi score-driven volatility models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the continuous-time limit of a class of Quasi Score-Driven (QSD) models that characterize volatility. As the sampling frequency increases and the time interval tends to zero, the model weakly converges to a continuous-time stochastic volatility model where the two Brownian motions are correlated, thereby capturing the leverage effect in the market. Subsequently, we identify that a necessary condition for non-degenerate correlation is that the distribution of driving innovations differs from that of computing score, and at least one being asymmetric. We then illustrate this with two typical examples. As an application, the QSD model is used as an approximation for correlated stochastic volatility diffusions and quasi maximum likelihood estimation is performed. Simulation results confirm the method's effectiveness, particularly in estimating the correlation coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how a Cram\'er-Wold theorem for a family of multivariate probability distributions can be used to generate a similar theorem for mixtures (convex combinations) of distributions drawn from the same family.
  Using this abstract result, we establish a Cram\'er-Wold theorem for mixtures of multivariate Gaussian distributions. According to this theorem, two such mixtures can be distinguished by projecting them onto a certain predetermined finite set of lines, the number of lines depending only on the total number Gaussian distributions involved and on the ambient dimension. A similar result is also obtained for mixtures of multivariate $t$-distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the optimal stopping problem of maximising the expected payoff in a game where a nonnegative reward is granted upon stopping on a success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. These Bernoulli stopping problems are characterised by a recurrence relation connecting the stopping and continuation payoffs. This recurrence is used to establish optimality of the myopic strategy under unimodal continuation payoffs. Further, by embedding the success epochs of the trials into a Markov chain, the transition matrix of the chain maps the stopping payoffs into continuation payoffs. A total positivity argument shows that the expectation of a unimodal function of the chain is shown to be unimodal in the initial state. This property establishes the unimodality of the stopping payoffs as a sufficient condition for the optimality of the myopic rule. Illustrative applications of this result include the $m$th last-success problem and its generalisation.</description>

Abstract: We show that, for general convolution approximations to a large class of log-correlated Gaussian fields, the properly normalised supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures converge stably to a nontrivial limit. This limit depends on the choice of regularisation only through a multiplicative constant and can be characterised as an integrated atomic measure with a random intensity expressed in terms of the critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

      <title>Structured coalescents, coagulation equations and multi-type branching processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a structured population consisting of $d$ colonies, with migration rates that are proportional to a positive parameter $K$. We sample $N_K$ individuals distributed evenly across the $d$ colonies and trace their ancestral lineages back. Within a colony, we assume that pairs of ancestral lineages coalesce at a constant rate, as in a Kingman's coalescent. We identify each ancestral lineage with the set, or block, of its descendants in the sample and we encode the state of the system using a $d$-dimensional vector of empirical measures; the $i$-th component records the blocks present in colony $i$ and the initial location of the lineages composing each block. We are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of the process of empirical measures as $K\to\infty$. We consider two regimes: the critical sampling regime, where $N_K \sim K$ and the large sampling regime where $N_K \gg K$. After an appropriate time-space scaling, we show that the process of empirical measures converges to the solution of a $d$-dimensional coagulation equation. In the critical sampling regime, the solution can be represented in terms of a multi-type branching process. In the large sampling regime, the solution can be represented in terms of the entrance law of a multi-type continuous state branching process.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic of Coulomb gas integral, Temperley-Lieb type algebras and pure partition functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this supplementary note, we study the asymptotic behavior of several types of Coulomb gas integrals and construct the pure partition functions for multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ and general multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems.
  For both radial and chordal cases, we prove the linear independence of the ground state solutions $J_{\alpha}^{(m,n)}(\boldsymbol{x})$ to the null vector equations for irrational values of $\kappa \in (0,8)$.
  In particular, we show that the ground state solutions $J^{(m,n)}_\alpha \in B_{m,n}$, indexed by link patterns $\alpha$ with $m$ screening charges, are linearly independent when $\kappa$ is irrational. This is achieved by constructing, for each link pattern $\beta$, a dual functional $l_\beta \in B^{*}_{m,n}$ such that the meander matrix of the corresponding Temperley-Lieb type algebra is given by $M_{\alpha\beta} = l_{\beta}(J^{(m,n)}_\alpha)$. The determinant of this matrix admits an explicit expression and is nonzero for irrational $\kappa$, establishing the desired linear independence.
  As a consequence, we construct the pure partition functions $Z_{\alpha}(\boldsymbol{x})$ of the multiple $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems for each link pattern $\alpha$ by multiplying the inverse of the meander matrix.
  This method can also be extended to the asymptotic analysis of the excited state solutions $K_{\alpha}$ in both radial and chordal cases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive an $L^p$-chaos expansion based on iterated Stratonovich integrals with respect to a given exponentially integrable continuous semimartingale. By omitting the orthogonality of the expansion, we show that every $p$-integrable functional, $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be approximated by a finite sum of iterated Stratonovich integrals. Using (possibly random) neural networks as integrands, we therefere obtain universal approximation results for $p$-integrable financial derivatives in the $L^p$-sense. Moreover, we can approximately solve the $L^p$-hedging problem (coinciding for $p = 2$ with the quadratic hedging problem), where the approximating hedging strategy can be computed in closed form within short runtime.</description>

      <title>Strategy Complexity of B\"uchi Objectives in Concurrent Stochastic Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 2-player zero-sum concurrent (i.e., simultaneous move) stochastic B\"uchi games and Transience games on countable graphs. Two players, Max and Min, seek respectively to maximize and minimize the probability of satisfying the game objective. The B\"uchi objective is to visit a given set of target states infinitely often. This can be seen as a special case of maximizing the expected $\limsup$ of the daily rewards, where all daily rewards are in $\{0,1\}$. The Transience objective is to visit no state infinitely often, i.e., every finite subset of the states is eventually left forever. Transience can only be met in infinite game graphs. We show that in B\"uchi games there always exist $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies that use just a step counter (discrete clock) plus 1 bit of public memory. This upper bound holds for all countable graphs, but it is a new result even for the special case of finite graphs. The upper bound is tight in the sense that Max strategies that use just a step counter, or just finite memory, are not sufficient even on finite game graphs. This upper bound is a consequence of a slightly stronger new result: $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies for the combined B\"uchi and Transience objective require just 1 bit of public memory (but cannot be memoryless). Our proof techniques also yield a closely related result, that $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies for the Transience objective alone can be chosen as memoryless.</description>

      <title>Weak Generative Sampler to Efficiently Sample Invariant Distribution of Stochastic Differential Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling invariant distributions from an It\^o diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in biased and correlated samples. The current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in the form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from a base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for min-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Our method necessitates neither the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centers related to the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control is Almost Optimal for Restless Bandit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete time infinite horizon average reward restless markovian bandit (RMAB) problem. We propose a \emph{model predictive control} based non-stationary policy with a rolling computational horizon $\tau$. At each time-slot, this policy solves a $\tau$ horizon linear program whose first control value is kept as a control for the RMAB. Our solution requires minimal assumptions and quantifies the loss in optimality in terms of $\tau$ and the number of arms, $N$. We show that its sub-optimality gap is $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in general, and $\exp(-\Omega(N))$ under a local-stability condition. Our proof is based on a framework from dynamic control known as \emph{dissipativity}. Our solution easy to implement and performs very well in practice when compared to the state of the art. Further, both our solution and our proof methodology can easily be generalized to more general constrained MDP settings and should thus, be of great interest to the burgeoning RMAB community.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Lyapunov method for fully heterogeneous weakly-coupled MDPs</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge for many real-world large-scale decision-making problems but remains largely understudied. In this paper, we study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems, known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is large. We show that, under mild assumptions, an efficiently computable policy achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in the long-run average reward per arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our main technical innovation is the construction of projection-based Lyapunov functions that certify the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region, even under full heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>A new architecture of high-order deep neural networks that learn martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new deep-learning neural network architecture based on high-order weak approximation algorithms for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is proposed. The architecture enables the efficient learning of martingales by deep learning models. The behaviour of deep neural networks based on this architecture, when applied to the problem of pricing financial derivatives, is also examined. The core of this new architecture lies in the high-order weak approximation algorithms of the explicit Runge--Kutta type, wherein the approximation is realised solely through iterative compositions and linear combinations of vector fields of the target SDEs.</description>
