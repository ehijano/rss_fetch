      <title>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Social Imitation beyond Energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of stochastic thermodynamics during the last decades prompted the discovery of novel nonequilibrium relations refining our understanding of the second law in small fluctuating systems and its connection with information theory. A fundamental open question is whether these powerful tools can illuminate other areas of complex systems, such as social phenomena, where energy plays no fundamental role. Here we develop a framework that derives a ``second law" for social systems. Similarly to Landauer's principle, it constrains spontaneous changes in agent attributes (opinions, cultural traits, etc.) and their informational entropy. We apply this framework to toy agent-based models of social imitation with non-trivial phase diagrams. We demonstrate how cornerstone results -- fluctuation theorems, kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations, and second-law-like inequalities -- emerge naturally in this context, even across symmetry-breaking transitions. These results reveal fundamental trade-offs in opinion currents arising from the competition between herding and anti-conformity. Moreover, they provide inference tools to extract model parameters from observations of stochastic changes in agents.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cooperative Driving Strategies for Stop-and-Go Wave Mitigation via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves in traffic flow pose a persistent challenge, compromising safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. This paper introduces a novel mitigation strategy discovered through training multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in a simulated ring-road environment. The agents autonomously develop a cooperative driving policy, where most vehicles maintain minimal headways to maximize throughput, while a single "buffer" vehicle adopts a larger headway to absorb perturbations and prevent wave propagation. This strategy enhances stability without sacrificing overall flow. We further demonstrate that adapting this cooperative strategy to classical car-following models, such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), yields improved stability and traffic efficiency. Furthermore, we show within a parametrised linear framework, that the cooperative strategy can optimise system performance under stability constraints. Our findings offer promising insights for future autonomous vehicle systems and highway management.</description>

      <title>Complex-Weighted Convolutional Networks: Provable Expressiveness via Complex Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM-based agents for social science research: insights from citation network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</description>
