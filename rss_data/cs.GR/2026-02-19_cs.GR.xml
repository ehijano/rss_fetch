      <title>CADEvolve: Creating Realistic CAD via Program Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) delivers rapid, editable modeling for engineering and manufacturing. Recent AI progress now makes full automation feasible for various CAD tasks. However, progress is bottlenecked by data: public corpora mostly contain sketch-extrude sequences, lack complex operations, multi-operation composition and design intent, and thus hinder effective fine-tuning. Attempts to bypass this with frozen VLMs often yield simple or invalid programs due to limited 3D grounding in current foundation models. We present CADEvolve, an evolution-based pipeline and dataset that starts from simple primitives and, via VLM-guided edits and validations, incrementally grows CAD programs toward industrial-grade complexity. The result is 8k complex parts expressed as executable CadQuery parametric generators. After multi-stage post-processing and augmentation, we obtain a unified dataset of 1.3m scripts paired with rendered geometry and exercising the full CadQuery operation set. A VLM fine-tuned on CADEvolve achieves state-of-the-art results on the Image2CAD task across the DeepCAD, Fusion 360, and MCB benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Style-Aware Gloss Control for Generative Non-Photorealistic Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can infer material characteristics of objects from their visual appearance, and this ability extends to artistic depictions, where similar perceptual strategies guide the interpretation of paintings or drawings. Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors.</description>

      <title>3DGEER: 3D Gaussian Rendering Made Exact and Efficient for Generic Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves an appealing balance between rendering quality and efficiency, but relies on approximating 3D Gaussians as 2D projections--an assumption that degrades accuracy, especially under generic large field-of-view (FoV) cameras. Despite recent extensions, no prior work has simultaneously achieved both projective exactness and real-time efficiency for general cameras. We introduce 3DGEER, a geometrically exact and efficient Gaussian rendering framework. From first principles, we derive a closed-form expression for integrating Gaussian density along a ray, enabling precise forward rendering and differentiable optimization under arbitrary camera models. To retain efficiency, we propose the Particle Bounding Frustum (PBF), which provides tight ray-Gaussian association without BVH traversal, and the Bipolar Equiangular Projection (BEAP), which unifies FoV representations, accelerates association, and improves reconstruction quality. Experiments on both pinhole and fisheye datasets show that 3DGEER outperforms prior methods across all metrics, runs 5x faster than existing projective exact ray-based baselines, and generalizes to wider FoVs unseen during training--establishing a new state of the art in real-time radiance field rendering.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation, vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our approach estimates time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.</description>

      <title>PartUV: Part-Based UV Unwrapping of 3D Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

      <title>From Pixels to Policies: Reinforcing Spatial Reasoning in Language Models for Content-Aware Layout Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning framework that equips large language models (LLMs) with explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for content-aware graphic layout design. LaySPA addresses two key challenges: LLMs' limited spatial reasoning and the lack of opacity in design decision making. Instead of operating at the pixel level, we reformulate layout design as a policy learning problem over a structured textual spatial environment that explicitly encodes canvas geometry, element attributes, and inter-element relationships. LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces. Experiments demonstrate that LaySPA improves structural validity and visual quality, outperforming larger proprietary LLMs and achieving performance comparable to specialized SOTA layout generators while requiring fewer annotated samples and reduced latency.</description>
