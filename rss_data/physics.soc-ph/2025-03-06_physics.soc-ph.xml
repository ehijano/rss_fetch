      <title>Energy burdens of carbon lock-in in household heating transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating electrification presents opportunities and challenges for energy affordability. Without careful planning and policy, the costs of natural gas service will be borne by a shrinking customer base, driving up expenses for those who are left behind. This affordability issue is worsened by new fossil fuel investments, which risk locking communities into carbon-intensive infrastructure. Here, we introduce a framework to quantify the distributional effects of natural gas phasedown on energy affordability, integrating detailed household data with utility financial and planning documents. Applying our framework first to Massachusetts and then nationwide, we show that vulnerable communities face disproportionate affordability risks in building energy transitions. Households that do not electrify may bear up to 50% higher energy costs over the next decade. Targeted electrification may help to alleviate immediate energy burdens, but household heating transitions will ultimately require coordinated, neighborhood-scale strategies that consider the high fixed costs of legacy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Hidden memory and stochastic fluctuations in science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the statistical laws governing citation dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in network theory and the science of science. Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions, yet they also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime, presenting an apparent contradiction that lacks a unified explanation. Here, we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process incorporating cumulative advantage. This process is characterised by the Hurst parameter $H$, derived from fractional Brownian motion, and volatility. Our framework reconciles this contradiction by demonstrating that anti-persistent fluctuations ($H&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$) give rise to log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent dynamics ($H&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}$) favour heavy-tailed power laws. Numerical simulations confirm our model's explanatory and predictive power, interpolating between log-normal and power-law distributions while reproducing the $t^{H}$ law. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints further supports our theory, revealing an intrinsically anti-persistent nature with an upper bound of approximately $H=0.13$. By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes.</description>

      <title>Predicting Cascade Failures in Interdependent Urban Infrastructure Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cascading failures (CF) entail component breakdowns spreading through infrastructure networks, causing system-wide collapse. Predicting CFs is of great importance for infrastructure stability and urban function. Despite extensive research on CFs in single networks such as electricity and road networks, interdependencies among diverse infrastructures remain overlooked, and capturing intra-infrastructure CF dynamics amid complex evolutions poses challenges. To address these gaps, we introduce the \textbf{I}ntegrated \textbf{I}nterdependent \textbf{I}nfrastructure CF model ($I^3$), designed to capture CF dynamics both within and across infrastructures. $I^3$ employs a dual GAE with global pooling for intra-infrastructure dynamics and a heterogeneous graph for inter-infrastructure interactions. An initial node enhancement pre-training strategy mitigates GCN-induced over-smoothing. Experiments demonstrate $I^3$ achieves a 31.94\% in terms of AUC, 18.03\% in terms of Precision, 29.17\% in terms of Recall, 22.73\% in terms of F1-score boost in predicting infrastructure failures, and a 28.52\% reduction in terms of RMSE for cascade volume forecasts compared to leading models. It accurately pinpoints phase transitions in interconnected and singular networks, rectifying biases in models tailored for singular networks.

      <title>The Untapped Potential of Smart Charging: How EV Owners Can Save Money and Reduce Emissions Without Behavioral Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transportation sector is the single largest contributor to US emissions and the second largest globally. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to represent half of global car sales by 2035, emerging as a pivotal solution to reduce emissions and enhance grid flexibility. The electrification of buildings, manufacturing, and transportation is expected to grow electricity demand substantially over the next decade. Without effectively managed EV charging, EVs could strain energy grid infrastructure and increase electricity costs. Drawing on de-identified 2023 EV telematics data from Rivian Automotive, this study found that 72% of home charging commenced after the customer plugged in their vehicle regardless of utility time of use (TOU) tariffs or managed charging programs. In fewer than 26% of charging sessions in the sample, EV owners actively scheduled charging times to align or participate in utility tariffs or programs. With a majority of drivers concurrently plugged in during optimal charging periods yet not actively charging, the study identified an opportunity to reduce individual EV owner costs and carbon emissions through smarter charging habits without significant behavioral modifications or sacrifice in user preferences. By optimizing home charging schedules within existing plug-in and plug-out windows, the study suggests that EV owners can save an average of $140 annually and reduce the associated carbon emissions of charging their EV by as much as 28%.</description>

      <title>From equality to diversity -- bottom-up approach for hierarchy growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.00985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hierarchical topology is a common property of many complex systems. Here we introduce a simple but generic model of hierarchy growth from the bottom to the top. Therein, two dynamical processes are accounted for: agent's promotions to next hierarchy levels when local speakers are elected and followed by other agents and agent's degradations to the lowest hierarchy. Following the initial stage when all agents are at the bottom level in the course of time the system approaches a stationary state where new hierarchies no longer emerge and the distribution of agents at different levels is exponential. In the stationary state the average hierarchy level and the fraction of agents at the lowest level are independent from the system size however the height of hierarchy, i.e. maximal number of observed hierarchy levels grows logarithmically along the total number of agents. The average number of followers of an agent in the stationary state is much smaller than the number of followers he possessed at the promotion moment. Results from numerical simulations are confirmed by an analytical treatment based on the rate equation.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-induced local awareness behavior inferred from surveys and genetic sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior-disease models suggest that pandemics can be contained cost-effectively if individuals take preventive actions when disease prevalence rises among their close contacts. However, assessing local awareness behavior in real-world datasets remains a challenge. Through the analysis of mutation patterns in clinical genetic sequence data, we propose an efficient approach to quantify the impact of local awareness by identifying superspreading events and assigning containment scores to them.
  We validate the proposed containment score as a proxy for local awareness in simulation experiments, and find that it was correlated positively with policy stringency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we observe a temporary drop in the containment score during the Omicron wave in the United Kingdom, matching a survey experiment we carried out in Hungary during the corresponding period of the pandemic. Our findings bring important insight into the field of awareness modeling through the analysis of large-scale genetic sequence data, one of the most promising data sources in epidemics research.</description>

      <title>Remote sensing and GPS mobility reveal heat's impact on human activity across diverse climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme heat is a growing threat to both individual livelihoods and broader economies, killing a growing number of people each year as temperatures rise in many parts of the world and limiting productivity. Many studies document the link between heat waves and mortality or morbidity, and others explore the economic consequences of them, but few are able to determine how populations respond to the shock of extreme heat in day-to-day activity. Toward this end, we investigate the link between human mobility and ambient temperature. Examining Indonesia, India and Mexico, we show that extreme heat reduces mobility by up to 10% in urban settings, with losses concentrated midday. We examine the shape of the relationship, finding that while heat reduces activity, very hot days and very long heat waves may induce more of it, indicating different adaptation. Effects are stronger in poorer areas. Twinning these models with climate projections, we show that without adaptation mobility may fall 1-2% per year on aggregate, with certain seasons and places seeing activity fall by as much as 10%. According to our estimates, small cities will face the highest relative losses and large cities will experience the greatest absolute impacts.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Trade-off between Infections and Social Interactions Using a Compact Model of Endemic Infections on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many epidemiological and ecological contexts, there is a trade-off between infections and interactions. This arises because the links between individuals capable of spreading infections are also often associated with beneficial activities. Here, we consider how the presence of explicit network structure changes the optimal solution of a class of infection-interaction trade-offs. In order to do this, we develop and analyse a low-dimensional dynamical system approximating the network SIS epidemic. We find that network structure in the form of heterogeneous numbers of contacts can have a significant impact on the optimal number of contacts that comes out of a trade-off model.</description>

      <title>Extreme heat reduces and reshapes urban mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme heat is a problem in European countries and cities, with rising temperatures affecting ageing populations. Research on mobility during extreme heat remains limited to small samples and isolated contexts, leaving significant gaps in our understanding how entire populations adjust their day-to-day activities and how these adaptations vary across social groups. Here we use data from passive and active mobile network connections covering 13 million individuals in Spain (27% of the population) to examine extreme heat's impact on mobility at scale. We stratify by age, gender, economic class, and activity. Our findings show mobility falls by as much as 10% on hot days generally and 20% on hot afternoons specifically, when temperatures peak. Further differences emerge on hot days. Older adults cut travel to work and other activities, while those earning less are less able to avoid work; social mixing declines and spatial structure changes as activity falls in city centres. These disruptions have implications for urban economies, as curbed activity and interaction - both planned and unplanned - threaten the dynamism of cities as hubs of social and economic exchange.</description>

      <title>Human-Agent Interaction in Synthetic Social Networks: A Framework for Studying Online Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online social networks have dramatically altered the landscape of public discourse, creating both opportunities for enhanced civic participation and risks of deepening social divisions. Prevalent approaches to studying online polarization have been limited by a methodological disconnect: mathematical models excel at formal analysis but lack linguistic realism, while language model-based simulations capture natural discourse but often sacrifice analytical precision. This paper introduces an innovative computational framework that synthesizes these approaches by embedding formal opinion dynamics principles within LLM-based artificial agents, enabling both rigorous mathematical analysis and naturalistic social interactions. We validate our framework through comprehensive offline testing and experimental evaluation with 122 human participants engaging in a controlled social network environment. The results demonstrate our ability to systematically investigate polarization mechanisms while preserving ecological validity. Our findings reveal how polarized environments shape user perceptions and behavior: participants exposed to polarized discussions showed markedly increased sensitivity to emotional content and group affiliations, while perceiving reduced uncertainty in the agents' positions. By combining mathematical precision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues for investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation. This methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented opportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>The process of polarisation as a loss of dimensionality: measuring changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present new methods of measuring polarisation in social networks. We use Random Dot Product Graphs to embed social networks in metric spaces. Singular Value Decomposition of this social network then provider an embedded dimensionality which corresponds to the number of uncorrelated dimensions in the network. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the embedding of the network graph means that the dimensions in the network are becoming more correlated, and therefore the network is becoming more polarised.
  We demonstrate this method by analysing social networks such as communication interactions among New Zealand Twitter users discussing climate change issues and international social media discussions of the COP conferences. In both cases, the decreasing embedded dimensionality indicates that these networks have become more polarised over time. We also use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an increase of the isolation between distinct communities, or the increase of the predominance of one community over the other, in the social networks decrease the embedded dimensionality and are therefore identifiable as polarisation processes.</description>

      <title>Thermal Macroeconomics: An axiomatic theory of aggregate economic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An axiomatic approach to macroeconomics based on the mathematical structure of thermodynamics is presented. It deduces relations between aggregate properties of an economy, concerning quantities and flows of goods and money, prices and the value of money, without any recourse to microeconomic foundations about the preferences and actions of individual economic agents. The approach has three important payoffs. 1) it provides a new and solid foundation for aspects of standard macroeconomic theory such as the existence of market prices, the value of money, the meaning of inflation, the symmetry and negative-definiteness of the macro-Slutsky matrix, and the Le Chatelier-Samuelson principle, without relying on implausibly strong rationality assumptions over individual microeconomic agents. 2) the approach generates new results, including implications for money flow and trade when two or more economies are put in contact, in terms of new concepts such as economic entropy, economic temperature, goods' values and money capacity. Some of these are related to standard economic concepts (eg marginal utility of money, market prices). Yet our approach derives them at a purely macroeconomic level and gives them a meaning independent of usual restrictions. Others of the concepts, such as economic entropy and temperature, have no direct counterparts in standard economics, but they have important economic interpretations and implications, as aggregate utility and the inverse marginal aggregate utility of money, respectively. 3) this analysis promises to open up new frontiers in macroeconomics by building a bridge to ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. More broadly, we hope that the economic analogue of entropy (governing the possible transitions between states of economic systems) may prove to be as fruitful for the social sciences as entropy has been in the natural sciences.</description>
