      <title>HSBC 1950 to 2025: Conquering the world from British Hong Kong and London</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Co (HSBC) just survived a civil war intermitted by World War II. By the 1950s, it obviously needed to close all its branches in Mao's People's Republic of China, yet could somehow hold its Shanghai branch, which continued likely in the shadows, as non-state banking was illegalised and even simple land owners were executed merely for being labelled "capitalist". This Asia-focused bank --in spite of it all-- grew from these conditions into the behemoth it is today. Part of the growth was based on the economic boom in its core market Hong Kong, to which HSBC likely also contributed. To expand and diversify, HSBC continued the growth strategy that already started since its early days in the 1860s, this time just also inorganically: It acquired other banks, in most cases fully and in other regions. The most important acquisition was the takeover of the roughly equally-sized UK-based Midland Bank; for the following reasons: 1) It came just a year after the 1991 change of HSBC's headquarters and place of incorporation to London, so HSBC could smoothly integrate with Midland. This step also came with an additional listing of securities in London, providing HSBC funds. 2) These funds were used efficiently without much idling for the humongous acquisition. 3) The preceding decade of Margaret Thatcher's banking and finance deregulation in the UK created a beneficial environment for HSBC. 4) HSBC was proven right by the developments in Hong Kong, where the Communist Party of China illegally eroded democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties since 2020, despite promising to maintain these at least until 1 July 2047. A list of likely reasons for HSBC's prosperity and stability in face of the at times hostile environments is also provided, from which business lessons can be drawn.</description>

      <title>CBDC Stress Test in a Dual-Currency Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the potential impact of introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on financial stability in an emerging dual-currency economy (Romania), where the domestic currency (RON) coexists with the euro. It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system.</description>
