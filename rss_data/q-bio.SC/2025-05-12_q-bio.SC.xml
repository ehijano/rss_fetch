      <title>Local stabilizability implies global controllability in catalytic reaction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling complex reaction networks is a fundamental challenge in the fields of physics, biology, and systems engineering. Here, we prove a general principle for catalytic reaction systems with kinetics where the reaction order and the stoichiometric coefficient match: the local stabilizability of a given state implies global controllability within its stoichiometric compatibility class. In other words, if a target state can be maintained against small perturbations, the system can be controlled from any initial condition to that state. This result highlights a tight link between the local and global dynamics of nonlinear chemical reaction systems, providing a mathematical criterion for global reachability that is often elusive in high-dimensional systems. The finding illuminate the robustness of biochemical systems and offers a way to control catalytic reaction systems in a generic framework.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Inducible Genetic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genes are connected in complex networks of interactions where often the product of one gene is a transcription factor that alters the expression of another. Many of these networks are based on a few fundamental motifs leading to switches and oscillators of various kinds. And yet, there is more to the story than which transcription factors control these various circuits. These transcription factors are often themselves under the control of effector molecules that bind them and alter their level of activity. Traditionally, much beautiful work has shown how to think about the stability of the different states achieved by these fundamental regulatory architectures by examining how parameters such as transcription rates, degradation rates and dissociation constants tune the circuit, giving rise to behavior such as bistability. However, such studies explore dynamics without asking how these quantities are altered in real time in living cells as opposed to at the fingertips of the synthetic biologist's pipette or on the computational biologist's computer screen. In this paper, we make a departure from the conventional dynamical systems view of these regulatory motifs by using statistical mechanical models to focus on endogenous signaling knobs such as effector concentrations rather than on the convenient but more experimentally remote knobs such as dissociation constants, transcription rates and degradation rates that are often considered. We also contrast the traditional use of Hill functions to describe transcription factor binding with more detailed thermodynamic models. This approach provides insights into how biological parameters are tuned to control the stability of regulatory motifs in living cells, sometimes revealing quite a different picture than is found by using Hill functions and tuning circuit parameters by hand.</description>

      <title>Weak transcription factor clustering at binding sites can facilitate information transfer from molecular signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcription factor concentrations provide signals to cells that allow them to regulate gene expression to make correct cell fate decisions. Calculations for noise bounds in gene regulation suggest that clustering or cooperative binding of transcription factors decreases signal-to-noise ratios at binding sites. However, clustering of transcription factor molecules around binding sites is frequently observed. We develop two complementary models for clustering transcription factors at binding site sensors that allow us to study information transfer from a signal to a variable relevant to development, namely future cell fates, on the example of the signal morphogen Bicoid in early fly development. We find that weak cooperativity or clustering can allow for maximal information transfer, especially about the relevant variable. Why clustering is beneficial for transfer depends on how long the binding site sensor measures the signal before affecting downstream gene expression: for short measurements, clustering allows for the implementation of a switch, while for long measurements, weak clustering allows the sensor to access maximal developmental information provided in a nonlinear signal. Finally, we find that clustering can facilitate binding site sensors to achieve an optimal bound to molecular sensing, the information bottleneck (IB) bound. This IB optimality appears consistent with a biologically intuitive optimization.</description>

      <title>From Single Genes to Populations: Quantifying Broken Detailed Balance in Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Are there thermodynamic or information theoretic constraints governing mRNA expression? Here we use the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to assess detailed balance breaking in transcription. For the canonical two-state model of transcription, we derive exact analytic expressions for the entropy production rate of transcription at steady state, expressions that can be evaluated from knowledge of the kinetic parameters of the two-state model. This allows us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply. Overall, our study presents a theoretical and data-driven approach to uncovering the potential thermodynamic and information theoretic constraints that dictate observed behaviors in transcription.</description>
