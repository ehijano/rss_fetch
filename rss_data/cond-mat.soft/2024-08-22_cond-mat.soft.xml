      <title>Laser-patterned Thin-film Electrodes: Imaging Ion Accumulation and Trapped Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a straightforward electrode design featuring sharp edges with a curvature of a few hundred nanometers in radius, with which both ion accumulation and nanoparticle deposition can be observed under an alternating electrical potential. The electrodes, termed 'shark-teeth electrodes', are fabricated using a laser ablation technique optimized for facile nanostructure creation. This method involves successive, overlapping ablated discs in a thin film of gold, producing sharp tips that generate strong electric fields. When electrically polarized in an electrolyte solution, these sharp tips form a screening layer, facilitating the observation of ion and nanoparticle behavior.
  A total-internal reflection microscope is employed to monitor ion accumulation on these electrodes, demonstrating their capability in iontronic microscopy. Additionally, the same electrodes are used to track nanoparticle trapping under high-frequency alternating potentials. This dual functionality allows for the investigation of electrochemical and physical interactions between ions and colloidal nanoparticles, contributing valuable insights to the field of soft matter.</description>

      <title>Single parameter aging and density scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Di Lisio et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 159 064505 (2023)] analyzed a series of temperature down-jumps using the single-parameter aging (SPA) ansatz combined with a specific assumption about density scaling in the out-of-equilibrium system and did not find a good prediction for the largest down-jumps. In this paper we show that SPA in its original form does work for all their data including large jumps of \Delta T &gt; 20 K. Furthermore, we discuss different approaches to the extension of the density scaling concept to out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Mechanisms of Solid/Liquid Interfacial Heat Transfer in the Presence of a Meniscus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ molecular simulations to investigate the enhancement in thermal conductance at the solid/liquid interface in the presence of a meniscus reported previously (Klochko et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 25(4):3298-3308, 2023). We vary the solid/liquid interaction strength at Lennard-Jones interfaces for both confined liquid and meniscus systems, finding that the presence of a meniscus yields an enhancement in the interfacial thermal conductance across all wettabilities. However, the magnitude of the enhancement is found to depend on the surface wettability, initially rising monotonously for low to moderate wettabilities, followed by a sharp rise between moderate and high wettabilities. The spectral decomposition of heat flux formalism was applied to understand the nature of this phenomenon further. By computing the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the heat fluxes within both the interfacial solid and liquid, we show that the initial monotonous rise in conductance enhancement predominantly stems from a rise in the coupling of out-of-plane vibrations within both the solid and the liquid. In contrast, the subsequent sharp rise at more wetting interfaces is linked to sharp increases in the utilization of the in-plane modes of the solid and liquid. These observations result from the interplay between the solid/liquid adhesive forces and the liquid/vapor interfacial tension. Our results can aid engineers in optimizing thermal transport at realistic interfaces, which is critical to designing effective cooling solutions for electronics, among other applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of Frequency-Dependent Viscosity on Molecular Friction in Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between the frequency-dependent friction of a molecule in a liquid and the hydrodynamic properties of the liquid is fundamental for molecular dynamics. We investigate this connection for a water molecule moving in liquid water using all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and linear hydrodynamic theory. We analytically calculate the frequency-dependent friction of a sphere with finite surface slip moving in a viscoelastic compressible fluid by solving the linear transient Stokes equation, including frequency-dependent shear and volume viscosities, both determined from MD simulations of bulk liquid water. We also determine the frequency-dependent friction of a single water molecule moving in liquid water, as defined by the generalized Langevin equation from MD simulation trajectories. By fitting the effective sphere radius and the slip length, the frequency-dependent friction and velocity autocorrelation function from the transient Stokes equation and simulations quantitatively agree. This shows that the transient Stokes equation accurately describes the important features of the frequency-dependent friction of a single water molecule in liquid water and thus applies down to molecular length and time scales, provided accurate frequency-dependent viscosities are used. The frequency dependence of the shear viscosity of liquid water requires careful consideration of hydrodynamic finite-size effects to observe the asymptotic hydrodynamic power-law tail. In contrast, for a methane molecule moving in water, the frequency-dependent friction cannot be predicted based on a homogeneous model, which suggests, supported by the extraction of a frequency-dependent surface-slip profile, that a methane molecule is surrounded by a finite-thickness hydration layer with viscoelastic properties that are significantly different from bulk water.</description>

      <title>Hairygami: Analysis of DNA Nanostructures' Conformational Change Driven by Functionalizable Overhangs</title>

Abstract: DNA origami is a widely used method to construct nanostructures by self-assembling designed DNA strands. These structures are often used as "pegboards" for templated assembly of proteins, gold nanoparticles, aptamers, and other molecules, with applications ranging from therapeutics and diagnostics to plasmonics and photonics.
  Imaging these structures using AFM or TEM does not capture their full conformation ensemble as they only show their shape flattened on a surface. However, certain conformations of the nanostructure can position guest molecules into distances unaccounted for in their intended design, thus leading to spurious interactions between guest molecules that are designed to be separated. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to capture conformational ensemble of 2D DNA origami tiles and show that introducing single-stranded overhangs, which are typically used for functionalization of the origami with guest molecules, induces a curvature of the tile structure in the bulk. We show that the shape deformation is of entropic origin, with implications for design of robust DNA origami breadboards as well as potential approach to modulate structure shape by introducing overhangs. We then verify experimentally that the DNA overhangs introduce curvature into the DNA origami tiles in divalent as well as monovalent salt buffer conditions. We further experimentally verify that DNA origami functionalized with attached proteins also experience such induced curvature. We provide the developed simulation code implementing the enhanced sampling to characterize conformational space of DNA origami as open source software.</description>

      <title>Generally applicable physics-based equation of state for liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-based first-principles pressure-volume-temperature equations of state (EOS) exist for solids and gases but not for liquids due to the long-standing fundamental problems involved in liquid theory. Current EOS models that are applicable to liquids and supercritical fluids at liquid-like density under conditions relevant to planetary interiors and industrial processes are complex empirical models with many physically meaningless adjustable parameters. Here, we develop a generally applicable physics-based (GAP) EOS for liquids including supercritical fluids at liquid-like density. The GAP equation is explicit in the internal energy, and hence links the most fundamental macroscopic static property of fluids, the pressure-volume-temperature EOS, to their key microscopic property: the molecular hopping frequency or liquid relaxation time, from which the internal energy can be obtained. We test our GAP equation against available experimental data in several different ways and find good agreement. Our GAP equation, unavoidably and similarly to solid EOS, contains a semi-empirical term giving the energy of the static sample as a function of volume only (E_ST(V)). Our testing includes studies along isochores, in order to examine the validity of the GAP equation independently of the validity of any function we may choose to utilize for E_ST(V). The only other adjustable parameter in the equation is the Gruneisen parameter for the fluid. We observe that the GAP equation is similar to the Mie-Gruneisen solid EOS in a wide range of the liquid phase diagram. This similarity is ultimately related to the condensed state of these two phases. On the other hand, the differences between the GAP equation and EOS for gases are fundamental. Finally, we identify the key gaps in the experimental data that need to be filled in to proceed further with the liquid EOS.</description>

      <title>Reshaping and Enzymatic Activity may allow Viruses to move through the Mucus</title>

Abstract: Filamentous viruses like influenza and torovirus often display systematic bends and arcs of mysterious physical origin. We propose that such viruses undergo an instability from a cylindrically symmetric to a toroidally curved state. This ``toro-elastic'' state emerges via spontaneous symmetry breaking under prestress due to short range spike protein interactions magnified by %the filament's surface topography. Once surface stresses are sufficiently large, the filament buckles and the curved state constitutes a soft mode that can potentially propagate through the filament's material frame around a mexican-hat-type potential. In the mucus of our airways, which constitutes a soft, porous 3D network, glycan chains are omnipresent and influenza's spike proteins are known to efficiently bind and cut them. We next show that such a non-equilibrium enzymatic reaction can induce spontaneous rotation of the curved state, leading to a whole body reshaping propulsion similar to -- but different from -- eukaryotic flagella and spirochetes.</description>

Abstract: The precise control of complex reactions is critical for biological processes yet our inability to design for specific outcomes limits the development of synthetic analogues. Here, we leverage differentiable simulators to design nontrivial reaction pathways in colloidal assemblies. By optimizing over external structures, we achieve controlled disassembly and particle release from colloidal shells. Lastly, we characterize the role of configurational entropy in the structure via both forward calculations and optimization, inspiring new parameterizations of designed colloidal reactions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Thermodynamics of Collapse of Gels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimulus-induced volumetric phase transition in gels may be potentially exploited for various bio-engineering and mechanical engineering applications. Since the discovery of the phenomenon in the 1970s, extensive experimental research has helped understand the phase transition and related critical phenomena. Yet, little insight is available on the evolving microstructure. In this article, we aim at unravelling certain geometric aspects of the micromechanics underlying discontinuous phase transition in polyacrylamide gels. Towards this, we use geometric thermodynamics and a Landau-Ginzburg type free energy functional involving a squared gradient, in conjunction with Flory-Huggins theory. We specifically exploit Ruppeiner's approach of Riemannian geometry-enriched thermodynamic fluctuation theory, which was previously employed to investigate phase transitions in van der Waals fluids and black holes. The framework equips us with a scalar curvature that is typically indicative of certain aspects of the microstructure during phase transition. Since previous studies have indicated that curvature divergence relates to correlation length divergence, we infer that the gel possesses a heterogeneous microstructure during phase transition, i.e. at critical points. Curvature also provides an insight into the universality class of phase transition and the nature of polymer-polymer interactions.</description>

      <title>The Role of Excitations in Supercooled Liquids: Density, Geometry, and Relaxation Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy excitations play a key role in all condensed-matter systems, yet there is limited understanding of their nature in glasses, where they correspond to local rearrangements of groups of particles. Here we introduce an algorithm to systematically uncover these excitations up to the activation energy scale relevant to structural relaxation. We use it in a model system to measure the density of states on a scale never achieved before, confirming that this quantity shifts to higher energy under cooling, precisely as the activation energy does. Secondly, we show that the excitations' energetic and spatial features allow one to predict with great accuracy the dynamic propensity, i.e. the location of future relaxation dynamics. Finally, we find that excitations have a core whose properties, including the displacement of the most mobile particle, scale as a power-law of their activation energy and are independent of temperature. Additionally, they exhibit an outer deformation field that depends on the material's stability and, therefore, on temperature. We build a scaling description of these findings. Overall, our analysis supports that excitations play a crucial role in regulating relaxation dynamics near the glass transition, effectively suppressing the transition to dynamical arrest predicted by mean-field theories while also being strongly influenced by it.</description>

      <title>Circle packing on spherical caps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the packing of congruent disks on a spherical cap, for caps of different size and number of disks, $N$. This problem has been considered before only in the limit cases of circle packing inside a circle and on a sphere (Tammes problem), whereas all intermediate cases are unexplored. Finding the preferred packing configurations for a domain with both curvature and border could be useful in the description of physical and biological systems (for example, colloidal suspensions or the compound eye of an insect), with potential applications in engineering and architecture (e.g. geodesic domes).
  We have carried out an extensive search for the densest packing configurations of congruent disks on spherical caps of selected angular widths ($\theta_{\rm max} = \pi/6$, $\pi/4$, $\pi/2$, $3\pi/4$, $5 \pi/6$) and for several values of $N$. The numerical results obtained in the present work have been used to establish (at least qualitatively) some general features for these configurations, in particular the behavior of the packing fraction as function of the number of disks and of the angular width of the cap, or the nature of the topological defects in these configurations (it found that as the curvature increases the overall topological on the border tends to become more negative).
  Finally we have studied the packing configurations for $N = 19$, $37$, $61$, $91$ (hexagonal numbers) for caps ranging from the flat disk to the whole sphere, to observe the evolution (and eventual disappearance) of the curved hexagonal packing configurations while increasing the curvature.</description>

      <title>Rapid Polymorphic Screening using Sessile Microdroplets: Competitive Nucleation of Mannitol Polymorphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a rapid polymorphic screening approach based on contracting sessile microdroplets which offers several advantages: (1) achieves very high supersaturation to facilitate formation of metastable forms (2) allows systematic labeling of samples (3) gives access to statistical distribution of polymorphic selectivity as a function of experimental conditions (4) ensures the formation of crystal for each droplet, addressing the problem of uncrystallized droplets in traditional microfluidics. We studied the competitive nucleation of D-mannitol polymorphs and investigated the effect of droplet volume on polymorphic selectivity. We showed that our observed polymorph distributions at different volumes are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of classical nucleation theory except for very small volumes where thermodynamic confinement or surface effects could play a substantial role. Overall, our microfluidic approach can be a promising tool not only for routine screening of pharmaceutical polymorphs in the industrial context but also in the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying the competitive nucleation of polymorphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policy-guided Monte Carlo is an adaptive method to simulate classical interacting systems. It adjusts the proposal distribution of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to maximize the sampling efficiency, using a formalism inspired by reinforcement learning. In this work, we first extend the policy-guided method to deal with a general state space, comprising, for instance, both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom, and then apply it to a few paradigmatic models of glass-forming mixtures. We assess the efficiency of a set of physically inspired moves whose proposal distributions are optimized through on-policy learning. Compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods, the optimized proposals are two orders of magnitude faster for an additive soft sphere mixture but yield a much more limited speed-up for the well-studied Kob-Andersen model. We discuss the current limitations of the method and suggest possible ways to improve it.</description>

      <title>Energy landscape interpretation of universal linearly increasing absorption with frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absorption of elastic waves in complex media often depends on frequency in a linear way for both longitudinal and shear waves. This universal property occurs in media such as rocks, unconsolidated sediments, and human tissue. Absorption is due to relaxation processes at atomic scale up to the sub-micron scale of biological materials, and we argue that these processes are thermally activated. Unusual for ultrasonics and seismics, we can therefore express absorption as an integral over an activation energy landscape weighted by an energy distribution. The universal power-law property corresponds to a flat activation energy landscape corresponding to maximal randomness.</description>

      <title>Rectifying bedload flux variability from channel geometry and grain shape effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bedload transport occurs when a bed composed of sedimentary grains becomes mobile in response to the shearing by a flow of liquid. It shapes the landscapes of Earth and other planetary bodies by promoting the formation and growth of various multiscale geological features. Estimating the rate at which such processes take place requires accurate bedload flux predictions. However, even for highly idealized conditions in the laboratory, study-to-study variability of reported bedload flux measurements borders an order of magnitude. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, typically empirical methods to account for channel geometry effects in the determination of the transport-driving bed shear stress and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive and validate a universal method of bed shear stress determination and apply it to a number of independent grain-shape-controlled data sets from experiments and CFD-DEM simulations for a very diverse range of transport conditions. An existing physical bedload flux model, here generalized to account for grain shape variability, predicts almost all these data within a factor of 1.3, whereas a recently proposed grain shape correction of the bed shear stress (Deal et al., Nature 613, 298-302, 2023) substantially increases the bedload flux scatter across weak and intense transport conditions.</description>
