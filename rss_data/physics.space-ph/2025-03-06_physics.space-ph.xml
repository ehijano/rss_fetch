      <title>Field Aligned Currents and Aurora During the Terrestrial Alfven Wing State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When sub-Alfvenic (Alfven Mach number M_A &lt; 1) plasmas impact Earth, the magnetosphere develops Alfven wings. A Multiscale Atmosphere Geospace Environment (MAGE) global simulation of the April 2023 geomagnetic storm, validated against Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), reveals the mechanism of field-aligned current (FAC) generation and auroral precipitation for the terrestrial Alfven wings. Simulation and observations show northern hemisphere planetward flowing auroral electrons (negative FAC) are predominantly at magnetic local times (MLTs) 5-11. Just before the wings formed, solar wind conditions were similar and 1 &lt; M_A &lt; 2, yet negative FAC extended across the entire day-side and night-side dusk sectors. Flow vorticity drives FACs at the boundary of the Alfven wings and unshocked solar wind. The Alfven wing shape presents a different obstacle to the solar wind compared to typical lobe fluxes, producing the unique FAC and auroral patterns. New insights about Alfven wing FACs will generate new understanding of aurora for exoplanets inside their host star's Alfven zone.</description>

      <title>Recovering Ion Distribution Functions: I. Slepian Reconstruction of VDFs from MMS and Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma velocity distribution functions (VDFs) constitute a fundamental observation of numerous operational and future missions. An efficient parameterization of VDFs is crucial for (1) preserving enough information to investigate macroscopic moments along with kinetic effects, (2) producing smooth distributions whereby it is possible to perform derivatives in phase space to support numerical solvers, and (3) economic data management and its storage. Previous studies have used spherical harmonics as an efficient basis for representing electron VDFs. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm targeted towards decomposing ion VDFs measured by electrostatic analyzers onboard Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecrafts. We use Slepian functions, custom-designed bases providing compact support in phase space, initially developed in information theory and later used for terrestrial and planetary applications. In this paper, we choose well-studied, well-measured, and complex intervals from MMS and SolO containing a range of simpler gyrotropic and agyrotropic distributions to benchmark the robustness of our reconstruction method. We demonstrate the advantages of using Slepian functions over spherical harmonics for solar wind plasma distributions. We also demonstrate that our choice of basis representation efficiently preserves phase space complexities of a 3D agyrotropic distribution function. This algorithm shown in this study will be extended to Parker Solar Probe and future missions such as Helioswarm.</description>
