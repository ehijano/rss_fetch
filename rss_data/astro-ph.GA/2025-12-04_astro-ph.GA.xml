      <title>A Critical Evaluation of the Physical Nature of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) uncovered by JWST deep surveys. Their enigmatic properties challenge the canonical AGN paradigm and have stimulated ideas on early massive black hole (BH) formation. In this review, we summarize how early BHs shape the characteristic features of LRDs, how their nuclear environments differ from those of normal AGNs, and how future observations can distinguish between competing scenarios. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) LRDs show broad-line emission consistent with mass accretion onto BHs with $M_{\rm BH}\simeq 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$, suggesting that AGN activity is a plausible origin of their dominant red optical emission. (2) Stellar components can reproduce the continuum energetics through dusty star formation. However, the required stellar mass would be too large to remain consistent with other LRD properties. Therefore, a purely stellar origin is unlikely to be the dominant power source, although star formation may still contribute to the UV emission. (3) The coexistence of broad-line emission with Balmer absorption and break features on LRD spectra, neither of which can be explained by stellar populations, suggests that nuclear BHs are enshrouded by dense gas with a high covering fraction. (4) Gas-enshrouded AGNs can produce red optical spectra without requiring dust reddening through a combination of gas attenuation and thermal self-emission with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$, which also accounts for the flat infrared continuum. (5) From the spectral features and redshift evolution, LRDs are likely a transient phase in early BH growth, possibly the first accretion episodes of newborn BHs. (6) Testing models for LRD spectra and origins through time variability, ionizing sources, post-LRD objects, and low-redshift analogs is particularly promising.</description>

      <title>The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Density Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical searches for dark matter in the Milky Way require a reliable model for its density distribution, which in turn depends on the influence of baryonic feedback on the Galaxy. In this work, we utilize a new suite of Milky Way-mass halos from the DREAMS Project, simulated with Cold Dark Matter (CDM),to quantify the influence of baryon feedback and intrinsic halo-to-halo variance on dark matter density profiles. Our suite of 1024 halos varies over supernova and black hole feedback parameters from the IllustrisTNG model, as well as variations in two cosmological parameters. We find that Milky Way-mass dark matter density profiles in the IllustrisTNG model are largely insensitive to astrophysics and cosmology variations, with the dominant source of scatter instead arising from halo-to-halo variance. However, most of the (comparatively minor) feedback-driven variations come from the changes to supernova prescriptions. By comparing to dark matter-only simulations, we find that the strongest supernova wind energies are so effective at preventing galaxy formation that the halos are nearly entirely collisionless dark matter. Finally, regardless of physics variation, all the DREAMS halos are roughly consistent with a halo contracting adiabatically from the presence of baryons, unlike models that have bursty stellar feedback. This work represents a step toward assessing the robustness of Milky Way dark matter profiles, with direct implications for dark matter searches where systematic uncertainty in the density profile remains a major challenge.</description>

      <title>Infrared emission from $z \sim 6.5$ quasar host galaxies: a direct estimate of dust physical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars at the dawn of Cosmic Time ($z&gt;6$) are fundamental probes to investigate the early co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxy. Nevertheless, their infrared spectral energy distribution remains at the present time poorly constrained, due to the limited photometric coverage probing the far-infrared wavelength range where the dust modified black-body is expected to peak ($\sim80$ $\mathrm{\mu m}$). Here we present a study of the high-frequency dust emission via a dedicated ALMA Band 8 ($\sim$400 GHz) campaign targeting 11 quasar host galaxies at $6&lt;z&lt;7$. Combined with archival observations in other ALMA bands, this program enables a detailed characterization of their infrared emission, allowing for the derivation of dust masses ($M_{d}$), dust emissivity indexes ($\beta$), dust temperatures ($T_{d}$), infrared luminosities ($L_{IR}$), and associated star formation rates (SFRs). Our analysis confirms that dust temperature is on average higher in this sample (34-65 K) if compared to local main-sequence galaxies' values, and that this finding can be linked to the increased star formation efficiency we derive in our work, as also suggested by the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ deficit. Most remarkably, we note that the average value of $T_d$ of this sample doesn't differ from the one that is observed in luminous, ultra-luminous and hyper-luminous infrared galaxies at different redshifts that show no signs of hosting a quasar. Finally, our findings suggest that the presence of a bright AGN does not significantly bias the derived infrared properties, although further high-frequency, high-spatial resolution observations might reveal more subtle impacts on sub-kiloparsec scales.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Gas-stripping of Galaxies in Group Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how low-mass group environments ($M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{12-13}\,M_{\odot}$) influence the gas content of their satellite galaxies with $M_* &gt; 10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$ using the \NHtwo\ simulation. Many satellite galaxies preserve substantial gas reservoirs, yet show signs of outer gas stripping, reminiscent of jellyfish galaxies in clusters. In contrast, low-mass satellites ($&lt;10^8 \, M_{\odot}$) are largely gas-deficient, and some of them undergo gas removal within their host group by external pressure triggered by either galaxy interactions or ram pressure exerted by the hot intragroup medium. Complete gas removal in these satellite galaxies occurs when the external hydrodynamic pressure exceeds the gravitational restoring force, typically due to stochastic events such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or nearby galactic outflows. The emergence of a characteristic stellar mass of $10^8 \, M_{\odot}$ which determines the efficiency of gas removal in groups, likely reflects the differing scaling relations of external pressure with halo mass and gravitational restoring force with stellar mass. While tidal interactions can be a significant cause of gas loss in satellite galaxies, those severe enough to affect the gas content in the central regions typically lead to the complete disruption of the galaxy. Consequently, gas loss driven by tidal interactions may be underestimated in the studies focusing solely on surviving galaxies. Group environments, where environmental effects are weaker and satellite galaxies tend to have lower restoring forces due to their low masses, exhibit complex manifestations of gas loss that are not seen in more massive environments such as clusters.</description>

      <title>Joint JWST-DECam Lensing Reveals That the Bullet Cluster Is a Minor Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first robust virial masses of the Bullet Cluster's three individual components from a joint weak+strong lensing analysis combining JWST/NIRCam and DECam observations. Despite its status as the benchmark system for dark matter and merger studies, inferred mass ratios for the Bullet Cluster have spanned a wide range from $\sim$2:1 to $\gtrsim$10:1 over more than two decades. We revisit this tension through three key advances: (1) JWST's exceptional data quality enables us to resolve three distinct halos, (2) DECam's wide-field coverage beyond its virial radius eliminates the need for extrapolation, and (3) high-fidelity strong-lensing priors mitigate weak-lensing model bias. We obtain $M_{200c} = 15.11^{+2.48}_{-2.10} \times 10^{14}M_{\odot}$ for the main cluster and $1.49^{+0.32}_{-0.25} \times 10^{14}M_{\odot}$ for the subcluster, yielding a mass ratio of $10.14^{+3.22}_{-2.47}$, definitively classifying the Bullet Cluster as a minor merger. This result reconciles the long-standing tension in the mass ratio and provides updated initial parameters for future modeling of this iconic system.</description>

      <title>An Ancient Descendant of the First Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed unexpectedly bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Their overabundance suggests that they are preferentially observed during burst phases, where their star formation rates increase dramatically. In cosmological simulations, such bursts transition into short ($\approx 40$ Myr) periods without star formation or naps. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band observations, we report the discovery of the galaxy CANUCS-A370-2228423 ($z = 5.95 \pm 0.06$, $\log(M_\ast/M_{\odot}) = 9.14 \pm 0.09$), dubbed The Sleeper. Its star formation history indicates rapid assembly in the first 300 Myr ($z \gtrsim 14$), where it formed a $\log(M_\ast/M_{\odot}) = 8.7^{+0.3}_{-0.4}\ M_{\odot}$ progenitor, comparable in stellar mass to the few spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at those redshifts. Unexpectedly, this is followed by several hundred million years of suppressed star formation, in stark contrast to nappers. This results in a remarkably strong hydrogen Balmer break, exceeding that of any galaxy observed within the first billion years by a factor of $\approx 3$. Furthermore, Sleeper-like systems are overabundant in the observed survey volume compared to theory, as the probability of finding such galaxies in simulations is $&lt; 0.2\%$. The discovery of The Sleeper therefore disrupts the current narrative that all luminous galaxies in the first few hundred million years grow into massive descendants. Instead it presents an alternative evolutionary pathway in which these unusually luminous galaxies fade into inefficient dwarfs after an early starburst, revealing greater diversity in the first stages of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO. XXIV. Measurement of the Hubble constant from the doubly lensed quasar HE1104-1805</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay cosmography leverages strongly lensed quasars to measure the Universe's current expansion rate, H_0, independently from other methods. While the latest TDCOSMO results relied mainly on quadruply lensed quasars, doubly lensed systems are far more common and offer precise time delays, potentially enlarging the usable sample by a factor of five and enabling percent-level constraints on H_0. We present the first TDCOSMO analysis of a doubly imaged source, HE1104-1805, including the measurement of the four necessary ingredients. First, by combining 17 years of data from the SMARTS, Euler and WFI telescopes, we measure a time delay of 176.3\pm 10.8 days. Second, using MUSE data, we extract stellar velocity dispersion measurements in three radial bins with up to 5% precision. Third, employing F160W HST imaging for lens modelling and marginalising over various modelling choices, we measure the Fermat potential difference between the images. Fourth, using wide-field imaging, we measure the convergence added by objects not included in the lens modelling. Hence, we measure the time delay distance and the angular diameter distance to the deflector, favouring a power-law mass model over a baryonic and dark matter composite model. The measurement was performed blindly and yielded H_0 = 64.2^{+5.8}_{-5.0} x $\lambda_{int} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, where \lambda_{int} is the internal mass sheet degeneracy parameter. This is in agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 milestone and its precision for \lambda_{int}=1 is comparable to that obtained with the best-observed quadruply lensed quasars (4-6%). This work is a stepping stone towards a precise measurement of H_0 using a large sample of doubly lensed quasars, supplementing the current sample. The next TDCOSMO milestone paper will include this system in its hierarchical analysis, constraining \lambda_{int} and H_0 jointly with multiple lenses.</description>

      <title>(Re)solving the complex multi-scale morphology and V-shaped SED of a newly discovered strongly-lensed Little Red Dot in Abell 383</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a luminous Little Red Dot (LRD) at $z=6.027$, doubly imaged by the galaxy cluster Abell 383 and observed with JWST/NIRCam. The source shows the characteristic "V-shaped" SED and pronounced Balmer break that define the LRD population. Owing to its large magnifications, $\mu\sim11$ for image S1 and $\mu\sim7$ for S2, the system is exceptionally bright and highly stretched, providing a rare, spatially resolved view of an LRD. The images reveal a complex morphology with a compact red dot, a spatially offset blue dot, and faint emission bridging and surrounding the two. After correcting for lensing, we find that both dots are extremely small but resolved, with rest-frame UV sizes of $\sim 20$ pc (red) and $\sim60$ pc (blue). These compact dots are embedded in a more extended, line-dominated cloud traced most clearly in F356W ([OIII]+H$\beta$), which reaches scales of order $\sim$1 kpc. SED decomposition shows that the blue component has a flat UV continuum consistent with a young stellar population, whereas the red component has a steep red SED that can be interpreted as either an evolved stellar population with high stellar mass ($\log M_\star/M_\odot&gt;10$) or a reddened AGN. If this object is representative of the LRD population, our results imply that the V-shaped SEDs of LRDs do not arise from individual compact sources but instead from the superposition of two physically distinct components. Separated by only $\sim300$ pc in the source plane, these components would blend into a single compact source in unlensed observations with the canonical LRD colors. This system therefore provides a rare opportunity to resolve the internal structure of an LRD and to gain direct insight into the physical nature of this population.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive JWST/NIRSpec Census of Broad-Line Active Galactic Nuclei: Faint, Tiny, but Highly Accreting Sources in the Remote Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 252 broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs), incorporating 171 newly identified sources, spanning a redshift interval from $z$ = 0.8 to 7.2. We have analyzed spectroscopic data from the NIRSpec instrument aboard the James Webb Space Telescope, using the G140H, G140M, G235H, G235M, G395H, and G395M gratings to survey N $\sim$ 80,000 galaxies for BLAGNs. Through emission-line fitting, using a sum of Gaussian models for {H$\alpha$}, {H$\beta$}, [N II] $\lambda\lambda6548, 6584$, and [O III] $ \lambda\lambda4959, 5007$, we separate AGN broad-line components from narrow-line emission. We find the detection rate of BLAGNs to be relatively consistent across our redshift range. Compared to typical low-$z$ AGNs ($z$ $\lesssim$ 1), the high-$z$ BLAGNs are systematically fainter and less massive, yet they accrete more efficiently, with most showing Eddington ratios between 0.1 and 1.0. This confirms the rapid black hole growth during the early cosmic epochs. The detection of faint, low-mass BLAGNs at high redshift also helps bridge the observational gap between local supermassive black holes and remote luminous quasars, providing a more complete view of black hole-galaxy coevolution across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Radio Detection of a Local Little Red Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z &gt; 4) of very large quantities of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (&lt; 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\pm$8 $\mu$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\pm$3 $\mu$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional model for the reversal in the local large-scale interstellar magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the three-dimensional geometry of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field within 1 kpc of the Sun using the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS) of the Northern Sky (DRAGONS). DRAGONS is a new full polarization survey of the Northern sky from 350 to 1030 MHz covering declinations -20{\deg} &lt; $\delta$ &lt; 90{\deg} and a component of GMIMS. The first moment of the Faraday depth spectra produced from DRAGONS above 500 MHz reveals large-angular-scale Faraday depth structures with signs that alternate only once in the Southern Galactic hemisphere and twice in the Northern hemisphere, patterns shared by other Faraday rotation datasets. DRAGONS is the first survey to achieve high Faraday depth resolution while maintaining sensitivity to broad Faraday depth structures, enabling the first use of Galactic longitude-Faraday depth plots. These plots reveal Faraday-complex structures across the sky, indicating a slab-like scenario in which emission and Faraday rotation are mixed. This complexity is overlaid on the same large-scale Faraday depth patterns that appear in the first moment map. We model these patterns as a magnetic reversal slicing through the disk on a diagonal and passing above the Sun in Galactic coordinates. We describe this reversal as a plane with a normal vector parallel to the line directed along ($\ell$, b) = (168.5{\deg}, -60{\deg}) and estimate its distance to be between 0.25 and 0.55 kpc. Our results show that much of the observed Faraday sky may be dominated by the local magnetic field configuration.</description>

      <title>Building a Radio AGN Sample from Cosmic Morning -- The Radio High-Redshift Quasar Catalog (RHzQCat): I. Catalog from SDSS Quasars and Radio Surveys at $z &gt; 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-loud high-redshift quasars (RHRQs) provide crucial insights into the evolution of relativistic jets and their connection to the growth of supermassive black holes. Beyond the extensively studied population at $z \ge 5$, the cosmic morning epoch ($3 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$) marks the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and black hole accretion, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we compiled the radio high-redshift quasar catalog (RHzQCat) by cross-matching the SDSS DR16Q catalog with four major radio surveys -- FIRST,NVSS, RACS, and GLEAM. Our tier-based cross-matching framework and visual validation ensured reliable source identification across surveys with diverse beam sizes. The catalog included 1629 reliable and 315 candidate RHRQs, with radio luminosities uniformly spanning $10^{25.5}$ -- $10^{29.3}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. About 95\% of the confirmed sources exhibited compact morphologies, consistent with Doppler-boosted or young AGN populations at high redshifts. Our catalog increases the number of known RHRQs at $z\ge3$ by an order of magnitude, representing the largest and most homogeneous catalog of radio quasars at cosmic morning, filling the observational gap between the early ($z&gt;6$) and local Universe. It provides a robust reference for future statistical studies of jet evolution, AGN feedback, and cosmic magnetism with next-generation facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).</description>

      <title>Dynamical and Photometric Analysis of NGC 146 and King 14: Evidence for a Co-Moving, Unbound Cluster Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the nature of the NGC 146-King 14 cluster pair, we conducted a detailed photometric, astrometric, and dynamical study using multiwavelength data from Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS1, WISE, and TESS. Using a probabilistic approach, we identified 770 and 690 high-probability members of NGC 146 and King 14, respectively. Both clusters exhibit well-defined radial density profiles consistent with King models. We estimate the cluster ages as 20 $\pm$ 5 Myr and 50 $\pm$ 10 Myr from isochrone fitting, and distances of 2.98 $\pm$ 0.33 kpc and 2.51 $\pm$ 0.23 kpc from parallaxes after applying the Bailer-Jones criteria. The clusters show consistent mean proper motions. The mass function slopes (1.51 $\pm$ 0.18 and 1.50 $\pm$ 0.15) are close to the Salpeter value, and the extinction follows a normal Galactic reddening law (RV ~ 3.1). Three-dimensional mapping gives a projected separation of ~ 9 pc. Orbit integration using the galpy MWPotential2014 model shows that NGC 146 and King 14 move in nearly circular, disk-like orbits with similar mean orbital radii (Rm ~ 9 kpc) and orbital periods of roughly 255 Myr. A dynamical separation of ~ 32 pc indicates that both clusters share a common spatial and kinematic association, consistent with a co-moving pair. However, their relative velocity exceeds the escape velocity set by their combined mass, indicating they are not gravitationally bound. TESS light curves reveal seven variable stars, including $\gamma$ Doradus, SPB stars, and eclipsing binaries, though only one is a likely member. Overall, the clusters likely formed within the same giant molecular cloud and now exist as an unbound co-moving pair.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Cosmic Evolution of the Cool Circumgalactic Medium of Luminous Red Galaxies with DESI Year 1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) of massive galaxies and their cosmic evolution. By using the year 1 dataset of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and QSOs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, we construct a sample of approximately 600,000 galaxy-quasar pairs and measure the radial distribution and kinematics of the cool gas traced by Mg II absorption lines as a function of galaxy properties from redshift 0.4 to redshift 1.2. Our results show that the covering fraction of the cool gas around LRGs increases with redshift, following a trend similar to the global evolution of galaxy star formation rate. At small radii (&lt; 0.3rvir), the covering fraction anti-correlates with stellar mass, suggesting that mass-dependent processes suppress the cool gas content in the inner region. In addition, we measure the gas dispersion by modeling the velocity distribution of absorbers with a narrow and a broad components -- sigma_n ~ 60 and sigma_b ~ 380 km/s -- and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that the broad component becomes more prominent in the outer region, and its relative importance in the central region grows with increasing stellar mass. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the cool gas around massive galaxies, including the contribution of satellite galaxies and the precipitation scenario.</description>

      <title>Separating halo and disk stars in galaxies with Fuzzy Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disk and halo stars are generally classified using several conventional methods, such as the Toomre diagram, sharp cuts in metallicity ([Fe/H]), vertical distance ($\left|Z\right|$) from the Galactic plane, or thresholds on the orbital circularity parameter ($\epsilon$). However, all these methods rely on hard selection cuts, which either contaminate samples when relaxed or exclude genuine members when applied too strictly, leading to uncertain and biased classifications. We develop a flexible and reliable approach to classify disk and halo stars in galaxies by applying fuzzy set theory, which can overcome the limitations of traditional hard-cut selection methods. As a case study, we analyze one of the Milky Way/M31-like galaxies in the TNG50 catalogue. We consider multiple stellar properties as fuzzy variables and characterize their variations between disk and halo stars to construct the respective membership functions. These functions are then combined to assign each star a membership degree corresponding to its galactic component. Our fuzzy set approach provides a more realistic distinction between the disk and the halo stars. This method effectively reduces contamination and recovers genuine members that are often excluded by rigid selection criteria. The fuzzy set theory framework offers a robust alternative to conventional hard-cut methods, enabling more accurate and physically meaningful separation of stellar populations in galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Nuclear Star Cluster of M 74: a fossil record of the very early stages of a star-forming galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSC) are dense and compact stellar systems, of sizes of few parsecs, located at galactic centers. Their properties and formation mechanisms seem to be tightly linked to the evolution of the host galaxy, with potentially different formation channels for late- and early-type galaxies (respectively, LTGs and ETGs). While most observations target ETGs, here we focus on the NSC in M 74 (NGC 628), a relatively massive, gas-rich and star-forming spiral galaxy, part of the PHANGS survey. We analyzed the central arcmin of the PHANGS-MUSE mosaic, in which the NSC is not spatially resolved. We performed a two-dimensional spectro-photometric decomposition of the MUSE cube, employing a modified version of the C2D code, to disentangle the NSC from the host galaxy. Here we used three components: a bulge, a disk and a NSC approximated to the point spread function (PSF), obtaining three data cubes, one for each component. This allowed us to extract separately the age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance for the NSC and the host galaxy. Our results show a very old and metal-poor NSC, in contrast to the surrounding regions. While similar properties were found in NSCs hosted by galaxies of different masses and/or morphological types from M 74, they are somewhat unexpected for a relatively massive star-forming spiral galaxy. The spatially resolved stellar populations of the host galaxy display much younger (light-weighted) ages and higher metallicities, especially in the central region (${\sim}500$ pc) surrounding the NSC. This suggests that this NSC formed a long time ago, and evolved passively until today, without any further growth. Our results show that the NSC was not involved in the active recent star-formation history of its host galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Nitrogen Enhanced High Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim5$) exhibiting unexpectedly bright ultraviolet (UV) nitrogen emission lines. The strong N III] and N IV] features imply nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O) as high as $-0.8 \lesssim \log(\mathrm{N/O}) \lesssim 0.4$ in these low-metallicity galaxies ($12+\log(\mathrm{O/H}) \lesssim 8.2$), compared to the local value of $\log(\mathrm{N/O})\approx-1.5$. If confirmed, this level of nitrogen enrichment challenges existing models of nucleosynthesis and galaxy evolution. However, the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can affect spectral diagnostics, and previous studies often excluded AGN contamination using photoionization models based on local N/O ratios. In this work, we compare nitrogen-enhanced AGN and H II region models to observed spectra of eight high-redshift galaxies to constrain their nitrogen abundance, excitation source, gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure, simultaneously. We find seven galaxies (GHZ9, GS 3073, GN-z9p4, CEERS-1019, GHZ2, GN-z11, and GS-z9-0) are best described by nitrogen-enhanced AGN models, while RXCJ2248-ID is best reproduced by the nitrogen-enhanced H II model. The presence of AGN does not significantly impact ($\lesssim0.1\,$dex) the derived N/O ratio. We also find that equivalent width (EW)-based diagrams are the most robust UV diagnostic diagrams to distinguish AGNs and star-forming galaxies for situations where the nitrogen abundance is varying. All nitrogen-enhanced galaxies have moderate to high gas pressure ($7.0\leq\log (P/k)\leq9.8$) and high ionization parameter ($\log(U)\gtrsim-2.0$), indicating a dense and compact environment. We suggest that super star clusters containing Wolf-Rayet stars and massive stars are the most likely contributors to the elevated nitrogen abundance in these galaxies.</description>

      <title>JWST Captures Growth of Aromatic Hydrocarbon Dust Particles in the Extremely Metal-poor Galaxy Sextans A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared spectrum of star-forming, high metallicity galaxies is dominated by emission features from aromatic and aliphatic bonds in small carbonaceous dust grains, often referred to as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In metal-poor galaxies, the abundance of PAHs relative to the total dust sharply declines, but the origin of this deficit is unknown. We present JWST observations that detect and resolve emission from PAHs in the 7% Solar metallicity galaxy Sextans A, representing the lowest metallicity detection of PAH emission to date. In contrast to higher metallicity galaxies, the clumps of PAH emission are compact (0.5-1.5'' or 3-10 pc), which explains why PAH emission evaded detection by lower resolution instruments like Spitzer. Ratios between the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 $\mu$m PAH features indicate that the PAH grains in Sextans A are small and neutral, with no evidence of significant processing from the hard radiation fields within the galaxy. These results favor inhibited grain growth over enhanced destruction as the origin of the low PAH abundance in Sextans A. The compact clumps of PAH emission are likely active sites of in-situ PAH growth within a dense, well-shielded phase of the interstellar medium. Our results show that PAHs can form and survive in extremely metal-poor environments common early in the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Taming the Tarantula: How Stellar Wind Feedback Shapes Gas and Dust in 30 Doradus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of massive star-forming regions show that classical stellar wind models over-predict the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas, indicating a significant fraction of wind energy is lost. In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the giant HII region 30 Doradus and its central star cluster R136 using 2 Ms of Chandra X-ray Observatory data, combined with James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Spitzer spectral-energy distributions, to investigate how the hot gas energy is lost through turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, and physical leakage. We compare the spatial and spectral properties of the hot gas with those of the warm ionized gas and dust. We find no significant correlation between the dust and hot gas temperatures, suggesting they are not directly coupled and that the dust resides in the swept-up shells where it is heated radiatively. H$\alpha$ and X-ray surface brightness profiles show that the X-rays peak interior to the H$\alpha$ shells, demonstrating partial confinement of the hot gas. The fragmented shell structure and bright X-ray interior that declines near the H$\alpha$ shell reflect efficient cooling from turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface. We compare against recent simulations of stellar-feedback driven bubbles which have broad agreement with the morphology of the X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission, but the simulations produce a dip in the interior X-ray surface brightness and a lack of hard X-rays compared to the observations. These differences may suggest thermal conduction is important as mass-loading of the hot bubble could reproduce the X-ray observables.</description>

      <title>The Mass-Metallicity Relation and its Observational Effects at z~3-6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity, known as the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), gives key insights into the processes that govern galaxy evolution. However, unquantified observational and selection biases can result in systematic errors in attempts to recover the intrinsic MZR, particularly at higher redshifts. We characterize the MZR at z~3-6 within a fully Bayesian framework using JWST NIRSpec spectra of 193 galaxies from the RUBIES survey. We forward model the observed mass-metallicity surface using prospector-generated spectra to account for two selection biases: the survey selection function and success in observing high signal-to-noise emission lines. We demonstrate that the RUBIES selection function, based on F444W magnitude and F150W-F444W color, has a negligible effect on our measured MZR. A correct treatment of the non-Gaussian metallicity uncertainties from strong-line calibrations lowers the derived MZR normalization by 0.2 dex and flattens the slope by ~20%; forward-modeling the effect of emission line observability steepens the slope by ~15%. Both of these biases must be taken into account in order to properly measure the intrinsic MZR. This novel forward modeling process motivates careful consideration of selection functions in future surveys, and paves the way for robust, high-redshift chemical enrichment studies that trace the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>A Catalogue of Interstellar Material Delivery From Nearby Debris Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We modeled the trajectories of material ejected from 20 nearby debris disk stars, including Epsilon Eridani (Ran), Vega, Fomalhaut, and Beta Pictoris, within a simulated Milky Way potential in order to quantify their contribution to the population of interstellar material entering the solar system. Our simulations show that material from each of these 20 systems is currently to be expected within our planetary system. We calculate expected fluxes of both macroscopic interstellar objects (ISOs, $\geq100~$m), which could be detected by telescopic surveys, and smaller meteoroids ($\geq200~$microns), which could manifest as meteors in Earth's atmosphere. We estimate that the ISO population originating from these debris disks and currently within the inner solar system is on the order of ~2, only a fraction of the expected total ISO population but nonetheless likely to be discovered by Rubin. Meteors in Earth's atmosphere from these systems are expected as well, but current methods, both radar and video, might require decades to collect even a single event. Our sample is found to be rich in relatively low excess velocity particles compared to the broader expected ISO population, which might make them harder to distinguish observationally from bound objects in some cases. These results provide a framework for linking detections of interstellar material to their astrophysical origins, offering new opportunities to probe the composition and dynamical history of nearby planetary systems.</description>

      <title>The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: Fundamental Plane Catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of peculiar velocities in the local Universe are a powerful tool to study the nature of dark energy at low ($z &lt; 0.1$) redshifts. Here we present the largest single set of $z&lt;0.1$ peculiar velocity measurements to date, obtained using the Fundamental Plane (FP) of galaxies in the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We describe the photometric and spectroscopic selection criteria used to define the sample, as well as extensive quality control checks on the photometry and velocity dispersion measurements. Additionally, we perform detailed systematics checks for the many analysis parameters in our pipeline. Our DESI DR1 catalogue contains FP-based distances and peculiar velocities for $98,292$ unique early-type galaxies, increasing the total number of $z &lt; 0.1$ FP distances ever measured by a factor of $\sim2$. We achieve a precision of $26\%$ random error in our distance measurements which is comparable to previous surveys. A series of companion DESI papers use the distances and peculiar velocities presented in this paper to measure cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Push-broom Mapping of Galaxies and Supernova Remnants with the SPRITE CubeSat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) enrich and energize the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) and are a key mechanism in the galaxy feedback cycle. The heating of the ISM by supernova shocks, and its subsequent cooling is critical to future star formation. The cooling of the diffuse shock-heated ISM is dominated by ultraviolet (UV) emission lines. These cooling regions and interfaces have complex spatial structure on sub-parsec scales. Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda &lt; 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 &lt; z &lt; 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds. The SPRITE SNR survey will use push-broom mapping of its long-slit on extended sources to produce the first large sample of sub-arcminute 3D data cubes of extended sources in the FUV. In this paper, we present simulated SPRITE observations of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs to demonstrate the efficacy of the SPRITE instrument ahead of launch and instrument commissioning. These models serve as critical planning tools and incorporate the final pre-flight predicted performance of the instrument and the early extended source data reduction pipeline.</description>

      <title>The BAGLE Python Package for Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the open-source Python package, BAGLE (Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events), which enables modeling and joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. We describe the model parameterizations and present the equations for microlensing events containing either a point-source, point-lens or a finite-source, point-lens geometry both with and without microlensing parallax due to the motion of the Earth or a satellite around the Sun. Conversions between different coordinate reference frames are also derived. We compare our model light curves to those from other papers and microlens modeling software, finding good agreement, although with some differences in finite-source models at a ~1% level detectable with upcoming observations from space-based facilities. We also use BAGLE to demonstrate the impact of changing lens mass, lens distance, and blended source flux fraction on photometric lightcurves and astrometric trajectories in preparation for upcoming Gaia data releases and the launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and its Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS). In particular, we show that Roman GBTDS will detect significant microlensing parallax signals for events that are 2x shorter in duration than from ground-based surveys. Additionally, long-duration events with durations of $\t_{E,\odot} &gt;$ 100 days will yield microlensing parallax uncertainties of ${\sigma}_{\pi_E} &lt;$ 0.01 with Roman, enabling confident identification of isolated stellar-mass black holes that can be modeled both astrometrically and photometrically with BAGLE for precise mass determinations. BAGLE is an open-source code and community development is encouraged.</description>

      <title>Modeling Binary Lenses and Sources with the BAGLE Python Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool that can be used to find and measure the mass of isolated and dark compact objects. In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. Therefore, in this study we present lensing equations for binary source and lens models in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) Python microlensing package. The new binary source and lens models in BAGLE account for the complete Keplerian orbit. BAGLE also includes binary models that approximate the orbital motion as linear or accelerating motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to break several microlensing degeneracies that plague photometry-only microlensing modeling. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys.</description>

      <title>A Deep Chandra X-ray Survey of a Luminous Quasar Sample at $z\sim$ 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new Chandra observations of seven luminous quasars at $z&gt;6.5$. Combined with archival Chandra observations of all other known quasars, they form nearly complete X-ray observations of all currently known $z\sim7$ quasars with $M_{1450}&lt;-26.5$, except for J0313$-$1806 at $z=7.642$ and J0910$-$0414 at $z=6.636$. Together with existing ground-based NIR spectroscopy and ALMA observations, we investigate the correlations between X-ray emission (the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and the optical/UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $\alpha_{\rm OX}$) and various quasar properties (rest-UV luminosity $L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$, bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, C IV blueshift, and infrared luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$). We find most $z&gt;6.5$ quasars follow a similar $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$ relation as $z\sim1-6$ quasars, but also display a large scatter. We find a potential correlation between $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and the C IV blueshift, suggesting a soft optical/UV-to-X-ray SED shape is frequently associated with fast disk winds. Furthermore, we analyze the X-ray spectrum of 11 quasars at $z&gt;6.5$ with Chandra detection, and find the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ is $2.41\pm0.27$, which is likely driven by high accretion rates of $z&gt;6.5$ quasars. In addition, we find there are no significant correlations between either $L_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, nor $L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, suggesting no strong correlations between quasar luminosity and star formation luminosity for the most luminous quasars at $z&gt;6.5$.</description>

      <title>Improving Accretion Diagnostics for Young Stellar Objects with Mid-infrared Hydrogen lines from JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of mid-infrared neutral hydrogen (H~\textsc{i}) emission lines in 79 nearby (d $&lt;$ 200 $pc$) young stars using JWST/MIRI. We aim to identify mid-infrared H~\textsc{i} transitions that can serve as reliable accretion diagnostics in young stars, and evaluate their utility in deriving physical conditions of the accreting gas. We identify and measure 22 H~\textsc{i} transitions in the MIRI wavelength regime (5-28 $\mu m$) and perform LTE slab modelling to remove the H\textsubscript{2}O contribution from selected H~\textsc{i} transitions. We find that mid-IR H~\textsc{i} line emission is spatially compact, even for sources with spatially extended [Ne~\textsc{ii}] and [Fe~\textsc{ii}] jets, suggesting minimal contamination from extended jet. Although Pfund~$\alpha$ (H~\textsc{i}~6--5) and Humphreys~$\alpha$ (H~\textsc{i}~7--6) are the strongest lines, they are blended with H$_2$O transitions. This blending necessitates additional processing to remove molecular contamination, thereby limiting their use as accretion diagnostics. Instead, we identify the H~\textsc{i}~(8--6) at 7.502 $\mu m$ and H~\textsc{i}~(10--7) at 8.760 $\mu m$ transitions as better alternatives, as they are largely unaffected by molecular contamination and offer a more reliable means of measuring accretion rates from MIRI spectra. We provide updated empirical relations for converting mid-IR H~\textsc{i} line luminosities into accretion luminosity for 6 different H~\textsc{i} lines in the MIRI wavelength range. Moreover, comparison of observed line ratios with theoretical models shows that MIR H~\textsc{i} lines offer robust constraints on the hydrogen gas density in accretion columns, $n_\mathrm{H} = $10$^{10.6}$ to 10$^{11.2}$ cm$^{-3}$ in most stars, with some stars exhibiting lower densities ($&lt;10^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$), approaching the optically thin regime.</description>

      <title>Approximations and modifications of celestial dynamics tested on the three-body system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale simulations of celestial systems are based on approximations or modifications of classical dynamics. The approximations are with ``particle-mesh'' (PM) substitutions of the attractions from objects far away, or one modify the Newtonian accelerations (MOND) or the gravities (MOGA). The PM approximation and MOND modification of classical dynamics break the invariances of classical dynamics. The simple three-body system (TBS) is the simplest system to test the approximations and modifications of celestial dynamics, and it is easy to implement on a computer. Simulations of the TBS show that the PM approximation and MOND destabilize TBS. In contrast, the MOGA modification of gravity by replacing Newton's inverse square attraction with an inverse attraction for far-away interactions stabilizes the system. The PM approximation and the MOND modification of classical dynamics do not preserve the momentum and angular momentum of a conservative system exactly, and PM does not obey Newton's third law. Although the errors and shortcomings of these PM approximations and MOND modifications are small, they cause the instability of the regular dynamics.</description>

      <title>On distance and velocity estimation in cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scatter in distance indicators introduces two conceptually distinct systematic biases when reconstructing peculiar velocity fields from redshifts and distances. The first is distance Malmquist bias (dMB) that affects individual distance estimates and can in principle be approximately corrected. The second is velocity Malmquist bias (vMB) that arises when constructing continuous velocity fields from scattered distance measurements: random scatter places galaxies at noisy spatial positions, introducing spurious velocity gradients that persist even when distances are corrected for dMB. Considering the Tully-Fisher relation as a concrete example, both inverse and forward formulations yield unbiased individual peculiar velocities for galaxies with the same true distance (the forward relation requires a selection-dependent correction), but neither eliminates vMB when galaxies are placed at their inferred distances. We develop a modified Wiener filter that properly encodes correlations between directly observed distance $d$ and true distance $r$ through the conditional probability $P(r|d)$, accounting for the distribution of true distances sampled by galaxies at observed distance $d$. Nonetheless, this modified filter yields suppressed amplitude estimates. Since machine learning autoencoders converge to the Wiener filter for Gaussian fields, they are unlikely to significantly improve velocity field estimation. We therefore argue that optimal reconstruction places galaxies at their observed redshifts rather than inferred distances; an approach effective when distance errors exceed $\sigma_v/H_0$, a condition satisfied for most galaxies in typical surveys beyond the nearby volume.</description>

      <title>The effect of baryons on the positions and velocities of satellite galaxies in the MTNG simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mock galaxy catalogues are often constructed from dark-matter-only simulations based on the galaxy-halo connection. Although modern mocks can reproduce galaxy clustering to some extent, the absence of baryons affects the spatial and kinematic distributions of galaxies in ways that remain insufficiently quantified. We compare the positions and velocities of satellite galaxies in the MTNG hydrodynamic simulation with those in its dark-matter-only counterpart, assessing how baryonic effects influence galaxy clustering and contrasting them with the impact of galaxy selection, i.e. the dependence of clustering on sample definition. Using merger trees from both runs, we track satellite subhaloes until they become centrals, allowing us to match systems even when their z=0 positions differ. We then compute positional and velocity offsets as functions of halo mass and distance from the halo centre, and use these to construct a subhalo catalogue from the dark-matter-only simulation that reproduces the galaxy distribution in the hydrodynamic run. Satellites in the hydrodynamic simulation lie 3-4% closer to halo centres than in the dark-matter-only case, with an offset that is nearly constant with halo mass and increases toward smaller radii. Satellite velocities are also systematically higher in the dark-matter-only run. At scales of 0.1 Mpc/h, these spatial and kinematic differences produce 10-20% variations in clustering amplitude -corresponding to 1-3$\sigma$ assuming DESI-like errors- though the impact decreases at larger scales. These baryonic effects are relevant for cosmological and lensing analyses and should be accounted for when building high-fidelity mocks. However, they remain smaller than the differences introduced by galaxy selection, which thus represents the dominant source of uncertainty when constructing mocks based on observable quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first multi-epoch milliarcsecond resolution imaging of the 6.7-GHz class II methanol maser emission associated with the high-mass protocluster system NGC6334I. The observations covered a period of over 10 years in four epochs between March 2010 and March 2020. We confirmed for the first time the emergence of 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission associated with NGC6334I-MM1, which lies north of the previously known sites of class IImethanol masers, NGC6334-MM2 and MM3. The new maser emission was located close to the strongest (sub)millimetre source in NGC6334I-MM1, identified as MM1-B, which experienced a sudden increase in intensity in 2015, produced by an episodic accretion event. We are able to compare the location and intensity of the 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission among the epochs before, during, and after the flare, providing new insights into the relationship between maser flares and episodic accretion events in high-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Marvelous Metals: Surveying the Circumgalactic Medium of Simulated Dwarf Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08861v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are uniquely sensitive to energetic feedback processes and are known to experience substantial mass and metal loss from their disk. Here, we investigate the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 64 isolated dwarf galaxies ($6.0&lt;$log(M$_*/M_{\odot}$)$&lt;9.5$) at $z=0$ from the Marvel-ous Dwarfs and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs hydrodynamic simulations. Our galaxies produce column densities broadly consistent with current observations. We investigate these column densities in the context of mass and metal retention rates and the physical properties of the CGM. We find $48\pm11\%$ of all baryons within $R_{200c}$ reside in the CGM, with $\sim70\%$ of CGM mass existing in a warm gas phase, $10^{4.5}&lt;T&lt;10^{5.5}$ K that dominates beyond $r/R_{200c}\sim0.5$. Further, the warm and cool ($10^{4.0}&lt;T&lt;10^{4.5}$ K) gas phases each retain $5-10\%$ of metals formed by the dwarf galaxy. The significant fraction of mass and metals residing in the warm CGM phase provides an interpretation for the lack of observed low ion detections beyond $b/R_{200c}\sim0.5$ at $z\sim0$, as the majority of mass in this region exists in higher ions. We find a weak correlation between galaxy mass and total CGM metal retention despite the fraction of metals lost from the halo increasing from $\sim10\%$ to $&gt;40\%$ towards lower masses. Our findings highlight the CGM (primarily its warm component) as a key reservoir of mass and metals for dwarf galaxies across stellar masses and underscore its importance in understanding the baryon cycle in the low-mass regime. Finally, we provide individual galaxy properties of our full sample and quantify the fraction of ultraviolet observable mass to support future observational programs, particularly those aimed at performing a metal budget around dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding $\sim 10\%$ of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.</description>

      <title>Constraints on a dark matter sub-halo near the Sun from pulsar timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using pulsar accelerations, we identify and constrain the properties of a dark matter sub-halo in the Galaxy for the first time from analyzing the acceleration field of binary and solitary pulsars. Our MCMC calculations show that this sub-halo has a mass of $2.45^{+1.07}_{-0.96} \times 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and is located at Galactocentric coordinates $X = 7.43^{+0.2}_{-0.12}~\rm$ kpc, $Y = 0.38^{+0.11}_{-0.16} ~\rm kpc$, $Z = 0.21^{+0.06}_{-0.11} ~\rm kpc$, using flat, uninformative priors, where we have modeled the sub-halo as a compact object. The Bayes factors for the models are in the range of $\sim$ 20-40, which indicates tentative evidence (though not yet decisive) for the sub-halo. Modeling the sub-halo with a NFW profile gives a sub-halo mass within the scale radius (0.1 kpc) of $0.48^{0.15}_{-0.16} \times 10^{7} M_{\odot}$, located at $X = 7.47^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$, $Y=0.38^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$, $Z=0.21^{+0.06}_{-0.11}$. We examine \textit{Gaia} data and the atomic and molecular hydrogen data of our Galaxy and show that the measured deviation from a smooth potential cannot arise from the gas or the stars in our Galaxy. By analyzing the full sample of binary pulsars with available acceleration measurements, we find that massive (with mass $&gt;10^{8}~M_{\odot}~$) sub-halos are disfavored for the Milky Way within several kiloparsec of the Sun. Smaller sub-halos are beyond the reach of current direct acceleration measurements. The presence of a $\sim 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ sub-halo within a few kpc of the Sun is potentially consistent with the expected number counts of sub-halos in the prevailing $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, for a substantial sub-halo mass fraction. This work now provides a proof of principle for probing nearby, low-mass sub-halos, and has implications across many fields of astrophysics - from understanding the nature of dark matter to galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Far-infrared lines hidden in archival deep multi-wavelength surveys: Limits on [CII]-158$\mu$m at $z \sim 0.3-2.9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singly-ionized carbon is theorized to be the brightest emission line feature in star-forming galaxies, and hence an excellent tracer of the evolution of cosmic star formation. Archival maps from far-infrared and sub-millimeter surveys potentially contain the redshifted [CII]-158$\mu$m, hidden in the much brighter continuum emission. We present a search for aggregate [CII]-158$\mu$m line emission across the predicted peak of star formation history by tomographically stacking a high-completeness galaxy catalog on broadband deep maps of the COSMOS field and constraining residual excess emission after subtracting the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED).
  We obtain constraints on the sky-averaged [CII]-158$\mu$m signal from the three Herschel/SPIRE maps: $11.8\pm10.2$, $11.0\pm8.7$, $9.6\pm9.8$, and $9.2\pm6.6$ $k$Jy/sr at redshifts $z\sim 0.65$, $\sim1.3$, $\sim2.1$, and $\sim2.6$ respectively, corresponding to $1-1.4\sigma$ significance in each bin. Our $3\sigma$ upper limits are in tension with past $z\sim2.6$ results from cross-correlating SDSS-BOSS quasars with high-frequency Planck maps, and indicate a much less dramatic evolution ($\sim\times7.5$) of mean [CII] intensity across the peak of star formation history than collisional excitation models or frameworks calibrated to the tentative PlanckxBOSS measurement. We discuss this tension, particularly in the context of in-development surveys (TIM, EXCLAIM) that will map this [CII] at high redshift resolution. Having demonstrated stacking in broadband deep surveys as a complementary methodology to next-generation spectrometers for line intensity mapping, our novel methods can be extended to upcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid, as well as to place upper limits on fainter atomic and molecular lines.</description>

      <title>Vz-GAL: Probing Cold Molecular Gas in Dusty Star-forming Galaxies at z=1-6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results of V\textit{z}-GAL, a high-redshift CO($J=1-0$) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 \textit{Herschel}-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshifts 1 to 6. These sources are selected based on having redshifts and mid/high-\textit{J} CO transitions from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array \zgal survey. We successfully detect CO($J=1-0$) emission in 90/92 galaxies at the expected positions and redshifts, including 9 tentative detections at $2\sigma - 3\sigma$ significance, and CO($J=2-1$) emission in 10 of these galaxies. The CO($J=1-0$) luminosities suggest apparent gas masses in the range $\mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times {10}^{11}~(\alpha_{CO}/{4.0})~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which implies gas depletion times of $(50-600)$~Myr. These timescales show similar spread as local ULIRGs, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent SFR per unit gas mass in starbursts across redshifts. To quantify the contribution of ``excitation correction" factors to gas mass estimates, we calculate median CO line brightness temperature ratios of $r_{21}=0.88\pm0.25$, $r_{31}=0.61\pm0.22$, $r_{41}=0.49\pm0.15$, $r_{51}=0.47\pm0.13$, and $r_{61}=0.28\pm0.13$. Accounting for these corrections results in a reduced scatter in `gas mass--star formation rate' relations. We also find a median log(${L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{[CI]}(^{3}P_1 - ^{3}P_0)}/{L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO}(J=1-0)})=-0.71\pm0.12$ for a subsample of 23 sources, consistent with the ratios derived for local star-forming galaxies. Together, our findings are in agreement with common conditions in the cold gas reservoirs among star-forming galaxies over a broad range in star formation modes, efficiencies, and scales.</description>

      <title>Photometric stellar masses for galaxies in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many areas of extragalactic astrophysics, we need to convert the luminosity of a galaxy into its stellar mass. In this work, we aim to find a simple and effective formula to estimate the stellar mass from the images of galaxies delivered by the currently popular DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This survey provides an unsurpassed combination of a deep imaging with an extensive sky coverage in up to four photometric bands. We calibrated the sought formula against a sample of local galaxies observed by the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) that was directly dedicated to measure the stellar masses. For the absolute magnitudes $M_g$ and $M_r$ of a galaxy in the Legacy Surveys $g$ and $r$ bands, we find that the stellar masses can be estimated as $0.673M_g - 1.108M_r + 0.996$ with the scatter of 25\%. Employing more complex functions does not improve the estimate appreciably, even after including the galaxy ellipticity, S\'ersic index, or the magnitudes in different Legacy Surveys bands. Generally, measurements in $r$ band were the most helpful ones, while adding $z$-band measurements did not improve the mass estimate much. We provide a Python-based script \texttt{photomass\_ls.py} to automatically download images of any galaxy from the Legacy Surveys database, create image masks, generate GALFIT input files with well-assessed initial values, perform the GALFIT photometry, and calculate the stellar mass estimate. Additionally, we tuned another version of the formula to the magnitudes provided by the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 (SGA-2020) with a scatter of 29\%. For both\,--\,our default and SGA-2020 formula, we offer two alternatives derived from different calibrations of S$^4$G masses that were based on different methods and assumptions.</description>

      <title>Fractional Dynamics in Galactic Nuclei: Non-Local Transport, Transient Phenomena and the Nullification of the Schwarzschild Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the application of fractional calculus to model stellar dynamics, focusing on Resonant Relaxation (RR) near a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Standard theories use the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, restricted to Gaussian processes under the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). We argue this is inadequate for RR. We demonstrate that gravitational interactions inherently produce infinite variance in stochastic torques, violating the CLT. Consequently, RR is governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT) and constitutes a superdiffusive L\'{e}vy flight. We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local operators, to explore resolutions to observational discrepancies. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts immediate, linear flux ($\Gamma(t) \propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict significant exponential delay. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically that non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping,'' bypassing bottlenecks like the Schwarzschild Barrier (SB), which local models interpret as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We present proof-of-concept $N$-body simulations that confirm non-local RR transport, although the resolution must be improved to rule out enhanced Two-Body Relaxation in the small-N setup. The fractional framework offers a compelling alternative description for non-local transport, potentially resolving TDE and EMRI rate questions.</description>

      <title>Galaxy clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys -- III. Star-forming fraction of brightest cluster galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution of the star-forming fraction ($F_{\mathrm{sf}}$) of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) at $z&lt;0.8$, using the galaxy clusters identified from the Legacy Imaging Surveys from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Star-forming galaxies are identified using the $g-z$ color, and $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ is measured as a function of redshift, cluster halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass. Field galaxies are used as a comparison sample to reduce selection effects. For BCGs, $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ increases with redshift, showing a slow rise below $z \sim 0.4 - 0.5$ and a more rapid increase above this range. In contrast, $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ decreases with increasing cluster halo mass and BCG stellar mass. At the low stellar mass end, BCGs exhibit higher star-forming fractions than field galaxies, suggesting enhanced star formation likely fueled by cold gas accretion from the intracluster medium. Also, star-forming BCGs tend to show larger projected offsets from the optical cluster density peak than quenching BCGs, indicating ongoing assembly. The analysis of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) further indicates a transition in the dominant mechanism driving star formation in BCGs: cooling flows are likely responsible at low redshift, while gas-rich mergers play a greater role at higher redshift. The shift in dominance occurs around $z \sim 0.5$, aligning with the steep rise in $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ of BCG.</description>

      <title>The impact of supermassive black holes on exoplanet habitability: I. Spanning the natural mass range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the influence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity on habitability has garnered attention, the specific effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) winds, particularly ultrafast outflows (UFOs), on planetary atmospheres remain largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between SMBH mass at the galactic center and exoplanetary habitability, given that SMBH masses are empirically confirmed to span approximately 5 orders of magnitude in galaxies. Through simplified models, we account for various results involving the relationships between the distance from the planet to the central SMBH and the mass of the SMBH. Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\sim100\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\geq 10^8 M_\odot$ in the energy-driven case. This study emphasizes that SMBH growth over cosmic time may have produced markedly different impacts on galactic habitability, depending on both the mass of the central black hole (BH) and the location of planetary systems within their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-3D: Two obscured X-ray AGNs with hot dust and He I$\lambda$10830 absorption at z~3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two broad-line X-ray AGNs cid_414 and cid_947 at z~3 that exhibit prominent He I$\lambda$10830+ Pa$\gamma$ emission and absorption, identified from the JWST Cycle 3 large GO treasury program COSMOS-3D using NIRCam F444W grism spectroscopy. Additional UV/optical line measurements (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, Si IV, C IV) come from complementary COSMOS-field spectroscopy. Both sources are robustly detected in the mid-infrared, with detections in MIRI F1000W for both AGNs and an additional detection in MIRI F2100W for cid_414, indicating the presence of hot dust emission. The source cid_947 shows a higher He I$\lambda$10830 absorption column density and X-ray-inferred $N_{\rm H}$, and displays strong outflow signatures in He I, Si IV, and C IV with velocity offsets exceeding 5000 km/s. The source cid_414 shows a narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission line with luminosity $\log L_{\rm Ly\alpha}=42.49\pm0.01~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and a higher intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. Host-galaxy decomposition and multi-component SED fitting indicate that cid_947 hosts a more massive black hole but lower star formation rate than cid_414. From simplified photoionization modeling, we infer that the dense absorbing gas has a characteristic size comparable to the nuclear broad-line region and is likely kinematically coupled to the obscuration associated with the dust torus. He I$\lambda$1083 absorption has also been identified in several compact little red dots at similar redshifts. Together with the two AGNs reported here, these findings suggest that dense circumnuclear gas are plausibly prevalent at high redshift and plays an important role in regulating AGN obscuration and black hole--host co-evolution.</description>

      <title>Evolution and Mass Dependence of UV-to-near-IR Color Gradients up to z=2.5 from HST+JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the redshift evolution of radial color gradients (in rest-frame ${\textit{U}} - {\textit{V}}$ and ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$) for galaxies in the range $0.5&lt;$ z $&lt;2.5$ and investigate their origin and dependence on stellar mass. We select $\sim 10,200$ galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star&gt;10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$ from publicly available JWST/NIRCam-selected catalogs. Using 2D S\'ersic profile fits to account for PSF broadening, we perform spatially resolved SED fitting on HST and JWST/NIRCam photometry retrieving accurate rest-frame ${\textit{U}} - {\textit{V}}$ and ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ color gradients within 2$R_\text{e, F444W}$. Star-forming galaxies generally exhibit negative ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ color gradients that are strongly mass and redshift dependent. For massive star-forming galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{10.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$) at $z&gt;1.5$ ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ colors are $\approx 0.5$ mag redder within the effective radius than outside, on average. We find that, at all redshifts and across the entire stellar mass range, ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ gradients strongly correlate with global attenuation ($A_V$), suggesting that they predominantly trace dust attenuation gradients. Edge-on galaxies are redder and have stronger gradients at all $z$, although the correlation weakens at higher $z$. The ${\textit{U}} - {\textit{V}}$ and ${\textit{V}} - {\textit{J}}$ color gradients in the quiescent galaxy population, in contrast, are weakly negative (from $\approx -0.1$ to $\approx- 0.2$ mag), though significant, and show little or no dependence on stellar mass, redshift or axis ratio. The implication is that quiescent galaxies must be largely transparent, with low $A_V$, and color gradients mostly attributable to stellar population gradients.</description>

      <title>Exploring Young Stellar Variability with Gaia DR3 light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Photometric variability is a defining characteristic of young stellar objects (YSO), which can be traced back to a range of physical processes taking place at different stages of young stars' formation and early evolution. Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented dataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO candidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for large-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the GDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO variability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By adapting the Q&amp;M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we seek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO variability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and periodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia light curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with appropriate sampling for the Q&amp;M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb Scargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales. Results: We successfully derived Q&amp;M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO sample. These variables were then classified into eight variability morphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms by using H$\alpha$ as a proxy of accretion and $\alpha_\mathrm{IR}$-indices to gauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Q&amp;M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We applied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our results are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term studies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of variability mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Solving Milky Way-sized Systems with Haskap Pie: A Halo finding Algorithm with efficient Sampling, K-means clustering, tree-Assembly, Particle tracking, Python modules, Inter-code applicability, and Energy solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a new Python-based stand-alone halo finding algorithm, Haskap Pie, that combines several methods of halo finding and tracking into a single calculation. Our halo-finder flexibly solves halos for simulations produced by eight simulation codes (ART-I, ENZO, RAMSES, CHANGA, GADGET-3, GEAR, AREPO, and GIZMO) and for both zoom-in or full-box N-body or hydrodynamical simulations and includes a unified, robust set of pre-tuned parameters. When compared to Rockstar and Consistent Trees, our halo-finder tracks subhalos much longer and more consistently, produces halos with better constrained physical parameters, and returns a much denser halo mass function for halos with more than 100 particles. Our results also compare favorably to recently described specialized particle-tracking extensions to Rockstar. Haskap Pie is well-suited to a variety of studies of simulated galaxies and is particularly robust for a new generation of studies of merging and satellite galaxies. For our initial paper, we focus on describing our algorithm's ability to find and track halos and subhalos in complex Milky Way-sized halo systems.</description>

      <title>The isotropy of Hubble expansion in the early and late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test the isotropy of Hubble expansion by combining several probes for the first time, constructing full-sky maps of expansion rate variation using Type Ia supernovae, fundamental plane galaxies, and CMB temperature fluctuations. We find no hint of anisotropy or correlation between early- and late-Universe expansion across all systematic models. The 99% confidence upper limits on expansion rate anisotropy are 0.39% for low-redshift supernovae, 0.95% for high-redshift CMB, and 0.37% when combined at a 60-degree smoothing scale. A significant anomaly in the fundamental plane residual map may reflect systematics in the current DESI dataset, as evidenced by the absence of cross-correlation with other tracers and its correlation with spatial density variations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the small-scale web around galaxies with miniJPAS and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first statistical observational study detecting filaments in the immediate surroundings of galaxies, i.e. the local web of galaxies. Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. Local filaments are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M* &gt;10^(10) Msun using all nearby galaxies as tracers, combined with a probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm designed to overcome limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models applied to a simulated lightcone. Besides recovering the expected increase in galaxy connectivity (defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy) with stellar mass, we show that our connectivity measurements agree with 3D reference estimates from the mock galaxies. Thanks to these filament reconstructions, we explore the relation between small-scale connectivity and galaxy star formation rate, finding a mild positive trend which needs to be confirmed by follow up studies with larger sample sizes. We propose galaxy connectivity to local filaments as a powerful and physically motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic structure in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Supernova Host Galaxies with FrankenBlast: A Scalable Tool for Transient Host Galaxy Association, Photometry, and Stellar Population Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FrankenBlast, a customized and improved version of the Blast web application. FrankenBlast associates transients to their host galaxies, performs host photometry, and runs a innovative SED fitting code to constrain host stellar population properties--all within minutes per object. We test FrankenBlast on 14,432 supernovae (SNe), ~half of which are spectroscopically-classified, and are able to constrain host properties for 9262 events. When contrasting the host stellar masses ($M_*$), specific star formation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction ($A_V$) between spectroscopically and photometrically-classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we determine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to misclassified events contaminating the photometrically-classified sample. We further show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically-classified sample also force their $M_*$ and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the spectroscopically-classified sample, as these properties are redshift-dependent. We compare host properties between spectroscopically-classified SN populations and determine if they primarily trace $M_*$ or SFR. We find that all SN populations seem to both depend on $M_*$ and SFR, with SNe II and IIn somewhat more SFR-dependent than SNe Ia and Ib/c, and SNe Ia more $M_*$-dependent than all other classes. We find the difference in the SNe Ib/c and II hosts the most intriguing and speculate that SNe Ib/c must be more dependent on higher $M_*$ and more evolved environments for the right conditions for progenitor formation. All data products and FrankenBlast are publicly available, along with a developing FrankenBlast version intended for Rubin Observatory science products.</description>

      <title>Probing the disk-jet coupling in M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Recent GMVA observations of M 87 at event horizon scales revealed a ring-like structure which is 50% larger at 86 GHz than the ring observed by the Event Horizon Telescope at 230 GHz. Aims. In this paper, we study a possible origin of the increased ring size at 86 GHz. We specifically aim to study the role the nonthermal electron population plays in the observed event horizon scales. Methods. We carry out 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations followed by radiative transfer calculations. We incorporate into the latter synchrotron emission from both thermal and nonthermal electrons. To better compare our results to observations, we generate synthetic interferometric data adjusted to the properties of the observing arrays. We fit geometrical models to this data in Fourier space through Bayesian analysis to monitor the variable ring size and width over the simulated time span of years. Results. We find that the 86 GHz ring is always larger than the 230 GHz ring, which can be explained by the increased synchrotron self-absorption at 86 GHz and the mixed emission from both the accretion disk and the jet footpoints, as well as flux arcs ejected from a magnetized disk. We find agreement with the observations, particularly within the error range of the observational value of M/D for M 87. Conclusions. We show that state-of-the art 3D GRMHD simulations combined with thermal and nonthermal emitting particles can explain the observed frequency-dependent ring size in M 87. Importantly we found that MAD events triggered in the accretion disk can significantly increase the lower frequency ring sizes.</description>

      <title>"SNe Ia twins" in the Hubble flow, and the determination of H0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have applied our approach of using ''SNe Ia twins''in the Hubble flow to obtain distances to SNe Ia at z $&gt;$ 0.015 and derive H$_{0}$.
  Our results, taking a single step between the low z domain and the Hubble flow, validate the three rung classical method.
  We find, however, that the full compilation of distances, both in Pantheon+ and in the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP),
  contain some inaccurate values in the colors due to an underestimate of reddening by dust. This produces odd individual values for H$_{0}$
  from single SNe Ia.
  On the average, those erroneous estimates do not affect the mean value of H$_{0}$, which is characterized by the bulk of well--modeled SNe Ia.
  Our sample of carefully addressed SNe Ia in the Hubble flow contains a dozen supernovae, for which the distances are determined with high accuracy.
  Three of these SNe Ia are of the Broad Line subtype and can be compared with SN 1989B in M66, a host galaxy with a unique convergence of the
  Cepheid distance determination and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars (TRGB) determination by the CCHP group. They point to a weighted average of
  H$_{0}$ $=$ 73.556 $\pm$ 2.084 (stat) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc $^{-1}$.
  There is as well a very good agreement on the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 5643 between those derived with Cepheids by SH0ES and those derived with
  the use of J-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (JAGB stars) by the CCHP, which makes them very good anchors.
  The sample of 12 SNe Ia gives a value of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.833 $\pm$ 1.306(stat) $\pm$ 1.151 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in Cepheids,
  and of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.388 $\pm$ 1.272 (stat) $\pm$ 1.015 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in JAGBs by the CCHP. We take a mean of the two
  values of H$_{0}$ and obtain H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.610 $\pm$ 1.289(stat) $\pm$ 1.085 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>
