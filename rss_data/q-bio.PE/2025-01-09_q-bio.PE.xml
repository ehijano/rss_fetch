      <title>SEIHRDV: a multi-age multi-group epidemiological model and its validation on the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel epidemiological model, referred to as SEIHRDV, for the numerical simulation of the COVID-19 epidemic, which we validate using data from Italy starting in September 2020. SEIHRDV features the following compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I), Healing (H), Recovered (R), Deceased (D) and Vaccinated (V). The model is age-stratified, as it considers the population split into 15 age groups. Moreover, it takes into account 7 different contexts of exposition to the infection (family, home, school, work, transport, leisure, other contexts), which impact on the transmission mechanism. Thanks to these features, the model can address the analysis of the epidemics and the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions, as well as possible vaccination strategies and the introduction of the Green Pass, a containment measure introduced in Italy in 2021. By leveraging on the SEIHRDV model, we successfully analyzed epidemic trends during the COVID-19 outbreak from September 2020 to July 2021. The model proved instrumental in conducting comprehensive what-if studies and scenario analyses tailored to Italy and its regions. Furthermore, SEIHRDV facilitated accurate forecasting of the future potential trajectory of the epidemic, providing critical information for informed decision making and public health strategies.</description>

      <title>Inferring resource competition in microbial communities from time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition for resources is a defining feature of microbial communities. In many contexts, from soils to host-associated communities, highly diverse microbes are organized into metabolic groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. The resource preferences of individual taxa that give rise to these guilds are critical for understanding fluxes of resources through the community and the structure of diversity in the system. However, inferring the metabolic capabilities of individual taxa, and their competition with other taxa, within a community is challenging and unresolved. Here we address this gap in knowledge by leveraging dynamic measurements of abundances in communities. We show that simple correlations are often misleading in predicting resource competition. We show that spectral methods such as the cross-power spectral density (CPSD) and coherence that account for time-delayed effects are superior metrics for inferring the structure of resource competition in communities. We first demonstrate this fact on synthetic data generated from consumer-resource models with time-dependent resource availability, where taxa are organized into groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. By applying spectral methods to oceanic plankton time-series data, we demonstrate that these methods detect interaction structures among species with similar genomic sequences. Our results indicate that analyzing temporal data across multiple timescales can reveal the underlying structure of resource competition within communities.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Variability: The Impact of Uneven Stochasticity on Competitive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competition between species and genotypes is a dominant factor in a variety of ecological and evolutionary processes. Biological dynamics are typically highly stochastic, and therefore, analyzing a competitive system requires accounting for the random nature of birth and death processes (demographic stochasticity) as well as the variability of external conditions (environmental stochasticity). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of species life history, showing that differences in life history lead competing species to experience different levels of demographic stochasticity. Here, we propose a simple model of two-species competition with different life histories and derive analytical expressions for various properties (fixation probability, fixation time, absorption time, probability density) under a wide range of conditions, including migration, selection, and environmental stochasticity. These properties provide insights into the long-term outcomes of competition, such as species persistence, extinction risks, and the influence of environmental variability on the evenness of the community.</description>
