      <title>Canard explosions in turbulent thermo-fluid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sudden transition to a state of high amplitude limit cycle oscillations is catastrophic in a thermo-fluid system. Conventionally, upon varying the control parameter, a sudden transition is observed as an abrupt jump in the amplitude of the fluctuations in these systems. In contrast, we present an experimental discovery of a canard explosion in a turbulent reactive flow system where we observe a continuous bifurcation with a rapid rise in the amplitude of the fluctuations within a narrow range of control parameters. The observed transition is facilitated via a state of bursting, consisting of the epochs of large amplitude periodic oscillations amidst the epochs of low amplitude periodic oscillations. The amplitude of the bursts is higher than the amplitude of the bursts of intermittency state in a conventional gradual transition, as reported in turbulent reactive flow systems. During the bursting state, we observe that temperature fluctuations of exhaust gas vary at a slower time scale in correlation with the amplitude envelope of the bursts. We also present a phenomenological model for thermoacoustic systems to describe the observed canard explosion. Using the model, we explain that the large amplitude bursts occur due to the slow-fast dynamics at the bifurcation regime of the canard explosion.</description>

      <title>Cascaded injection locking of optomechanical crystal oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical oscillators stand out as high-performance and versatile candidates for serving as reference clocks in sequential photonic integrated circuits. Indeed, they have the unique capability of simultaneously generating mechanical tones and optical signal modulations at frequencies determined by their geometrical design. In this context, the concept of synchronization introduces a powerful means to precisely coordinate the dynamics of multiple oscillators in a controlled manner, thus increasing efficiency and preventing errors in signal processing photonic systems or communication interfaces. In this work, we demonstrate the cascaded injection locking of a pair of silicon-based optomechanical crystal cavities to an external reference signal that subtly modulates the laser driving one of the oscillators. Both cavities interact solely through a weak mechanical link, making the extension of this synchronization mechanism to an increased number of optomechanical oscillators within a common chip more feasible than relying solely on optical interactions. Thus, the combination of the obtained results, supported by a numerical model, with remote optical injection locking schemes discussed in the literature, lays the groundwork for the distribution of reference signals within large networks of processing elements in future phonon-photon hybrid circuits.</description>

      <title>The Growth of Passive Membranes: Evidence from Ti and Like Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current contradictory understanding of passivation comes from overly-complex passive models, defective characterization and misplaced theoretical approaches. From brand-new experimentation, we find that a Ti passive membrane has spatiotemporally-ordered macrostructure. At the start, a thermodynamically-stable chemisorbed Ti-O monolayer is immediately formed to inactivate the outmost Ti atoms and shield direct reaction of environmental oxygens on metallic matrix, and then an underneath TiOx@Ti ceramet-like non-equilibrium gradient oxide layer rapidly forms. The two layers work synergistically to keep the macro-ordered passive membrane growing slowly via non-linear mechanism of incremental oxidation damping, thus effecting passivation. These findings disprove "the adsorption theory of passivation" and "the theory of passivity film" and inform a new theory we call "passivation theory of incremental oxidation damping".</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Interactions Reshape Topological Defect Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how non-reciprocal ferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring planar spins in two dimensions, affect the behaviour of topological defects. Non-reciprocity is introduced by weighting the coupling strength of the two-dimensional XY model by an anisotropic kernel. As a consequence, in addition to the topological charge $q$, the actual shape of the defects becomes crucial to faithfully describe their dynamics. Non-reciprocal coupling twists the spin field, selecting specific defect shapes, dramatically altering the pair annihilation process. Defect annihilation can either be enhanced or hindered, depending on the shape of the defects concerned and the degree of non-reciprocity in the system. We introduce a continuous description -- for which the phenomenological coefficients can be explicitly written in terms of the microscopic ones -- that captures the behaviour of the lattice model.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of cognition based on oscillatory and reinforcement processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building mathematical models of brains is difficult because of the sheer complexity of the problem. One potential starting point is through basal cognition, which give abstract representation of a range of organisms without central nervous systems, including fungi, slime moulds and bacteria. We propose one such model, demonstrating how a combination of oscillatory and current-based reinforcement processes can be used to couple resources in an efficient manner, mimicking the way these organisms function. A key ingredient in our model, not found in previous basal cognition models, is that we explicitly model oscillations in the number of particles (i.e. the nutrients, chemical signals or similar, which make up the biological system) and the flow of these particles within the modelled organisms. Using this approach, we find that our model builds efficient solutions, provided the environmental oscillations are sufficiently out of phase. We further demonstrate that amplitude differences can promote efficient solutions and that the system is robust to frequency differences. In the context of these findings, we discuss connections between our model and basal cognition in biological systems and slime moulds, in particular, how oscillations might contribute to self-organised problem-solving by these organisms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting institutional punishment in the $N$-person prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conflict between individual and collective interests makes fostering cooperation in human societies a challenging task, requiring drastic measures such as the establishment of sanctioning institutions. These institutions are costly because they have to be maintained regardless of the presence or absence of offenders. Here, we propose realistic improvements to the standard $N$-person prisoner's dilemma formulation with institutional punishment by eliminating overpunishment, requiring a minimum number of contributors to establish the sanctioning institution, and sharing the cost among them once this minimum number is reached. In addition, we focus on large groups or communities for which sanctioning institutions are ubiquitous. Using the replicator equation framework for an infinite population, we find that by sufficiently fining players who fail to contribute either to the public good or to the sanctioning institution, a population of contributors immune to invasion by these free riders can be established, provided that the contributors are sufficiently numerous. In a finite population, we use finite-size scaling to show that, for some parameter settings, demographic noise helps to fixate the strategy that contributes to the public good but not to the sanctioning institution even for infinitely large populations when, somewhat counterintuitively, its proportion in the initial population vanishes with a small power of the population size.</description>
