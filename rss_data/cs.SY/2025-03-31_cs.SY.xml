      <title>Towards explainable data-driven predictive control with regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven predictive control (DPC), using linear combinations of recorded trajectory data, has recently emerged as a popular alternative to traditional model predictive control (MPC). Without an explicitly enforced prediction model, the effects of commonly used regularization terms (and the resulting predictions) can be opaque. This opacity may lead to practical challenges, such as reliance on empirical tuning of regularization parameters based on closed-loop performance, and potentially misleading heuristic interpretations of norm-based regularizations. However, by examining the structure of the underlying optimal control problem (OCP), more precise and insightful interpretations of regularization effects can be derived. In this paper, we demonstrate how to analyze the predictive behavior of DPC through implicit predictors and the trajectory-specific effects of quadratic regularization. We further extend these results to cover typical DPC modifications, including DPC for affine systems, offset regularizations, slack variables, and terminal constraints. Additionally, we provide a simple but general result on (recursive) feasibility in DPC. This work aims to enhance the explainability and reliability of DPC by providing a deeper understanding of these regularization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Generalised Harmonic Domain Analysis for Transformer Core Hysteresis Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work identifies the general approach for linearising any power system component in the harmonic domain, that is with respect to its Fourier series coefficients. This ability enables detailed harmonic analysis, and is key as more power electronic devices inject harmonic currents into the power system to its shared detriment. The general approach requires a time domain model of the component, and is most applicable where a conversion to the frequency domain is impractical prior to linearisation. The outcome is a Norton equivalent current source, which expresses linear coupling between harmonic frequencies with admittance matrices. These are the so-called frequency coupling matrices. The general approach is demonstrated for magnetic hysteresis, where a Preisach model has been developed for this purpose. A new data driven approach is used to fit the test results of a small physical transformer to the Preisach model. Results show an improved accuracy in the frequency coupling matrices over models that only considered magnetic saturation. Maximum improvement is observed in the odd harmonic current to odd harmonic voltage couplings.</description>

      <title>Open-loop control design for contraction in affine nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, first, it is shown that if a nonlinear time-varying system is contractive, then it is incrementally exponentially stable. Second, leveraging this result, under mild restrictions, an approach is proposed to design feedforward inputs for affine in control systems providing contraction/incremental exponential stability. Unlike standard stability notions, which have well-established control design techniques, this note can be considered among the first ones to provide such a tool for a kind of incremental stability. The theoretical findings are illustrated by examples.</description>

      <title>Small-gain conditions for exponential incremental stability in feedback interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that under a small-gain condition, an interconnection of two globally incrementally exponentially stable systems inherits this property on any compact connected forward invariant set. It is also demonstrated that the interconnection inherits a weaker version of incremental exponential stability globally. An example illustrating the theoretical findings is given. The example also shows that the uniform negativity of the Jacobian is not necessary for incremental exponential stability.</description>

      <title>Smart Sensing Breaks the Accuracy Barrier in Battery State Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate state-of-charge (SOC) estimation is essential for optimizing battery performance, ensuring safety, and maximizing economic value. Conventional current and voltage measurements, however, have inherent limitations in fully inferring the multiphysics-resolved dynamics inside battery cells. This creates an accuracy barrier that constrains battery usage and reduces cost-competitiveness and sustainability across industries dependent on battery technology. In this work, we introduce an integrated sensor framework that combines novel mechanical, thermal, gas, optical, and electrical sensors with traditional measurements to break through this barrier. We generate three unique datasets with eleven measurement types and propose an explainable machine-learning approach for SOC estimation. This approach renders the measured signals and the predictive result of machine learning physically interpretable with respect to battery SOC, offering fundamental insights into the time-varying importance of different signals. Our experimental results reveal a marked increase in SOC estimation accuracy--enhanced from 46.1% to 74.5%--compared to conventional methods. This approach not only advances SOC monitoring precision but also establishes a foundation for monitoring additional battery states to further improve safety, extend lifespan, and facilitate fast charging.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for efficient and robust multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking in bioprocesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and robust bioprocess control is essential for maximizing performance and adaptability in advanced biotechnological systems. In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective robust controller synthesis with integral quadratic constraints in discrete-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel framework for the robust controller synthesis problem in discrete-time systems using dynamic Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs). We present an algorithm to minimize closed-loop performance measures such as the $\mathcal H_\infty$-norm, the energy-to-peak gain, the peak-to-peak gain, or a multi-objective mix thereof. While IQCs provide a powerful tool for modeling structured uncertainties and nonlinearities, existing synthesis methods are limited to the $\mathcal H_\infty$-norm, continuous-time systems, or special system structures. By minimizing the energy-to-peak and peak-to-peak gain, the proposed synthesis can be utilized to bound the peak of the output, which is crucial in many applications requiring robust constraint satisfaction, input-to-state stability, reachability analysis, or other pointwise-in-time bounds. Numerical examples demonstrate the robustness and performance of the controllers synthesized with the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Objective Simultaneous Routing, Facility Location and Allocation Model for Earthquake Emergency Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergency preparedness reduces the severity and impact of major disasters. In the case of earthquakes, a rapid and efficient emergency response is essential to reduce the number of fatalities. Therefore, the design and planning of an adequate emergency transportation network are crucial in earthquake-prone locations.
  In the context of emergency transportation modeling, the aim of emergency routing is to find the network with the minimum length that can provide access between the maximum number of Emergency Response Centers (ERCs) and damaged areas. Meanwhile, the goal of the facility location and allocation problem is to optimize the placement of temporary hospitals to increase coverage and accessibility, particularly in remote or severely impacted areas.
  This paper proposes a multi-objective, robust, multi-modal, and multi-time-period optimization problem that simultaneously optimizes routing, facility location, and hospital allocation. The objective function is to minimize unmet commodity demand, unserved injuries, and economic costs. We adopt a fuzzy goal programming approach to solve the multi-objective simultaneous routing, facility location, and allocation model.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient UAV movement and user-UAV association in multi-UAV networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These days, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems have drawn a lot of attention due to the increasing demand for faster data rates. Given the susceptibility of mmWave signals to obstacles and high propagation loss of mmWaves, ensuring line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity is critical for maintaining robust and efficient communication. Furthermore, UAVs have limited power resource and limited capacity in terms of number of users it can serve. Most significantly different users have different delay requirements and they keep moving while interacting with the UAVs. In this paper, first, we have provided an efficient solution for the optimal movement of the UAVs, by taking into account the energy efficiency of the UAVs as well as the mobility and delay priority of the users. Next, we have proposed a greedy solution for the optimal user-UAV assignment. After that, the numerical results show how well the suggested solution performs in comparison to the current benchmarks in terms of delay suffered by the users, number of unserved users, and energy efficiency of the UAVs.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of a Robust Control System for Triple Inverted Pendulum Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of robust controllers for triple inverted pendulum systems presents significant challenges due to their inherent instability and nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, uncertainties in system parameters further complicate the control design. This paper investigates a robust control strategy for triple inverted pendulums under parameter uncertainty. Two control approaches, namely the $H_\infty$ controller and the $\mu$-synthesis controller, are compared in terms of their ability to achieve reference tracking and disturbance rejection. Simulation results demonstrate that the $H_\infty$ controller provides superior transient performance, making it a promising solution for the robust stabilization of such complex systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage model predictive control for slug flow crystallizers using uncertainty-aware surrogate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic model for slug flow crystallizers that addresses the challenges of spatial distribution without backmixing or diffusion, potentially enabling advanced model-based control. The developed model can accurately describe the main characteristics of slug flow crystallizers, including slug-to-slug variability but leads to a high computational complexity due to the consideration of partial differential equations and population balance equations. For that reason, the model cannot be directly used for process optimization and control. To solve this challenge, we propose two different approaches, conformalized quantile regression and Bayesian last layer neural networks, to develop surrogate models with uncertainty quantification capabilities. These surrogates output a prediction of the system states together with an uncertainty of these predictions to account for process variability and model uncertainty. We use the uncertainty of the predictions to formulate a robust model predictive control approach, enabling robust real-time advanced control of a slug flow crystallizer.</description>

      <title>Neural Identification of Feedback-Stabilized Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling nonlinear dynamical systems. However, identifying these systems from closed-loop experimental data remains a challenge due to the correlations induced by the feedback loop. Traditional nonlinear closed-loop system identification methods struggle with reliance on precise noise models, robustness to data variations, or computational feasibility. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the identified model is stabilized by the same controller used during data collection, ensuring alignment with the true system's closed-loop behavior. The dual Youla parameterization provides a promising solution for linear systems, offering statistical guarantees and closed-loop stability. However, extending this approach to nonlinear systems presents additional complexities. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable framework for identifying complex, potentially unstable systems while ensuring closed-loop stability using a complete parameterization of systems stabilized by a given controller. We establish asymptotic consistency in the linear case and validate our method through numerical comparisons, demonstrating superior accuracy over direct identification baselines and compatibility with the true system in stability properties.</description>

      <title>Finding Unknown Unknowns using Cyber-Physical System Simulators (Extended Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based approaches are among the most practical means to search for safety violations, bugs, and other unexpected events in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Where existing approaches search for simulations violating a formal specification or maximizing a notion of coverage, in this work we propose a new goal for testing: to discover unknown rare behaviors by examining discrete mode sequences. We assume a CPS simulator outputs mode information, and strive to explore the sequences of modes produced by varying the initial state or time-varying uncertainties. We hypothesize that rare mode sequences are often the most interesting to a designer, and we develop two accelerated sampling algorithms that speed up the process of finding such sequences. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, ranging from synthetic examples to Simulink diagrams of a CPS, demonstrating in some cases a speedup of over 100x compared with a random sampling strategy.</description>

      <title>Verifying Nonlinear Neural Feedback Systems using Polyhedral Enclosures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As dynamical systems equipped with neural network controllers (neural feedback systems) become increasingly prevalent, it is critical to develop methods to ensure their safe operation. Verifying safety requires extending control theoretic analysis methods to these systems. Although existing techniques can efficiently handle linear neural feedback systems, relatively few scalable methods address the nonlinear case. We propose a novel algorithm for forward reachability analysis of nonlinear neural feedback systems. The approach leverages the structure of the nonlinear transition functions of the systems to compute tight polyhedral enclosures (i.e., abstractions). These enclosures, combined with the neural controller, are then encoded as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Optimizing this MILP yields a sound over-approximation of the forward-reachable set. We evaluate our algorithm on representative benchmarks and demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement over the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Nonlinear Model Reduction to Spectral Submanifolds via Oblique Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics in a primary Spectral Submanifold (SSM) constructed over the slowest modes of a dynamical system provide an ideal reduced-order model for nearby trajectories. Modeling the dynamics of trajectories further away from the primary SSM, however, is difficult if the linear part of the system exhibits strong non-normal behavior. Such non-normality implies that simply projecting trajectories onto SSMs along directions normal to the slow linear modes will not pair those trajectories correctly with their reduced counterparts on the SSMs. In principle, a well-defined nonlinear projection along a stable invariant foliation exists and would exactly match the full dynamics to the SSM-reduced dynamics. This foliation, however, cannot realistically be constructed from practically feasible amounts and distributions of experimental data. Here we develop an oblique projection technique that is able to approximate this foliation efficiently, even from a single experimental trajectory of a significantly non-normal and nonlinear beam.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Semantic Communications via Large Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to revolutionize the design, optimization and management of next-generation communication systems. In this article, we explore the integration of large AI models (LAMs) into semantic communications (SemCom) by leveraging their multi-modal data processing and generation capabilities. Although LAMs bring unprecedented abilities to extract semantics from raw data, this integration entails multifaceted challenges including high resource demands, model complexity, and the need for adaptability across diverse modalities and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a LAM-based multi-task SemCom (MTSC) architecture, which includes an adaptive model compression strategy and a federated split fine-tuning approach to facilitate the efficient deployment of LAM-based semantic models in resource-limited networks. Furthermore, a retrieval-augmented generation scheme is implemented to synthesize the most recent local and global knowledge bases to enhance the accuracy of semantic extraction and content generation, thereby improving the inference performance. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed LAM-based MTSC architecture, highlighting the performance enhancements across various downstream tasks under varying channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Route-and-Aggregate Decentralized Federated Learning Under Communication Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (D-FL) allows clients to aggregate learning models locally, offering flexibility and scalability. Existing D-FL methods use gossip protocols, which are inefficient when not all nodes in the network are D-FL clients. This paper puts forth a new D-FL strategy, termed Route-and-Aggregate (R&amp;A) D-FL, where participating clients exchange models with their peers through established routes (as opposed to flooding) and adaptively normalize their aggregation coefficients to compensate for communication errors. The impact of routing and imperfect links on the convergence of R&amp;A D-FL is analyzed, revealing that convergence is minimized when routes with the minimum end-to-end packet error rates are employed to deliver models. Our analysis is experimentally validated through three image classification tasks and two next-word prediction tasks, utilizing widely recognized datasets and models. R&amp;A D-FL outperforms the flooding-based D-FL method in terms of training accuracy by 35% in our tested 10-client network, and shows strong synergy between D-FL and networking. In another test with 10 D-FL clients, the training accuracy of R&amp;A D-FL with communication errors approaches that of the ideal C-FL without communication errors, as the number of routing nodes (i.e., nodes that do not participate in the training of D-FL) rises to 28.</description>

      <title>Approximating Dispatchable Regions in Three-Phase Radial Networks with Conditions for Exact SDP Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of dispatchable region plays a pivotal role in quantifying the capacity of power systems to accommodate renewable generation. In this paper, we extend the previous approximations of the dispatchable regions on direct current (DC), linearized, and nonlinear single-phase alternating current (AC) models to unbalanced three-phase radial (tree) networks and provide improved outer and inner approximations of dispatchable regions. Based on the nonlinear bus injection model (BIM), we relax the non-convex problem that defines the dispatchable region to a solvable semidefinite program (SDP) and derive its strong dual problem (which is also an SDP). Utilizing the special mathematical structure of the dual problem, an SDP-based projection algorithm is developed to construct a convex polytopic outer approximation to the SDP-relaxed dispatchable region. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the exact SDP relaxation by adding the power loss as a penalty term, thereby providing a theoretical guarantee for determining an inner approximation of the dispatchable region. Through numerical simulations, we validate the accuracy of our approximation of the dispatchable region and verify the conditions for exact SDP relaxation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Constrained Online Nonconvex Optimization with Compressed Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents. For a time-varying graph, we propose a distributed online primal-dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources. We show that the proposed algorithm establishes an $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{\max \{ {1 - {\theta_1},{\theta_1}} \}}}} )$ network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}( {T^{1 - {\theta_1}/2}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound, where $T$ is the number of iterations and ${\theta_1} \in ( {0,1} )$ is a user-defined trade-off parameter. When Slater's condition holds (i.e, there is a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints at all iterations), the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal{O}( {T^{1 - {\theta_1}}} )$. These bounds are comparable to the state-of-the-art results established by existing distributed online algorithms with perfect communication for distributed online convex optimization with (time-varying) inequality constraints. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Centralized Planning and Distributed Execution Method for Shape Filling with Homogeneous Mobile Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nature has inspired humans in different ways. The formation behavior of animals can perform tasks that exceed individual capability. For example, army ants could transverse gaps by forming bridges, and fishes could group up to protect themselves from predators. The pattern formation task is essential in a multiagent robotic system because it usually serves as the initial configuration of downstream tasks, such as collective manipulation and adaptation to various environments. The formation of complex shapes, especially hollow shapes, remains an open question. Traditional approaches either require global coordinates for each robot or are prone to failure when attempting to close the hole due to accumulated localization errors. Inspired by the ribbon idea introduced in the additive self-assembly algorithm by the Kilobot team, we develop a two-stage algorithm that does not require global coordinates information and effectively forms shapes with holes. In this paper, we investigate the partitioning of the shape using ribbons in a hexagonal lattice setting and propose the add-subtract algorithm based on the movement sequence induced by the ribbon structure. This advancement opens the door to tasks requiring complex pattern formations, such as the assembly of nanobots for medical applications involving intricate structures and the deployment of robots along the boundaries of areas of interest. We also provide simulation results on complex shapes, an analysis of the robustness as well as a proof of correctness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic analysis of systems with affine input and polynomial state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide exact and terminating algorithms for the formal analysis of deterministic continuous-time control systems with affine input and polynomial state dynamics (in short, polynomial systems). We consider the following semantic properties: zeroness and equivalence, input independence, linearity, and analyticity. Our approach is based on Chen-Fliess series, which provide a unique representation of the dynamics of such systems via their formal generating series.
  Our starting point is Fliess' seminal work showing how the semantic properties above are mirrored by corresponding combinatorial properties on generating series. Next, we observe that the generating series of polynomial systems coincide with the class of shuffle-finite series, a nonlinear generalisation of Sch\"utzenberger's rational series which has recently been studied in the context of automata theory and enumerative combinatorics. We exploit and extend recent results in the algorithmic analysis of shuffle-finite series (such as zeroness, equivalence, and commutativity) to show that the semantic properties above can be decided exactly and in finite time for polynomial systems. Some of our analyses rely on a novel technical contribution, namely that shuffle-finite series are closed under support restrictions with commutative regular languages, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Task Hierarchical Control via Null-Space Projection and Path Integral Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of hierarchical task control, where a robotic system must perform multiple subtasks with varying levels of priority. A commonly used approach for hierarchical control is the null-space projection technique, which ensures that higher-priority tasks are executed without interference from lower-priority ones. While effective, the state-of-the-art implementations of this method rely on low-level controllers, such as PID controllers, which can be prone to suboptimal solutions in complex tasks. This paper presents a novel framework for hierarchical task control, integrating the null-space projection technique with the path integral control method. Our approach leverages Monte Carlo simulations for real-time computation of optimal control inputs, allowing for the seamless integration of simpler PID-like controllers with a more sophisticated optimal control technique. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this combined approach, showing how it overcomes the limitations of traditional</description>

      <title>Worst-Case Analysis of Decoupled Policies for Multi-Location Inventory Control Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difference in performance between centralized and decentralized control strategies crucially informs design choices in real-world control systems. Although computing and executing centralized control algorithms is often more costly than decentralized methods, their performance enhancements may far outweigh these costs. In this work, we study the value of centralization within the context of the well-known inventory control problem, where a planner seeks to identify optimal inventory levels that meet stochastic demand while minimizing ordering costs, holding costs, and shortage costs. We consider multilocation systems in which the inventories are coupled through a single ordering channel and the associated ordering cost function belongs to one of two classes of nonlinear cost functions that often arise in practical settings. For each of these classes, we derive constant-factor competitive ratios between the optimal coupled and decoupled policies and show they are almost tight. We then demonstrate that online algorithms also achieve tight competitive ratios for this problem. We conclude with numerical simulations that validate these results.</description>

      <title>Leader-Follower Formation and Tracking Control of Underactuated Surface Vessels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Technical Note presents a simple control approach for global trajectory tracking and formation control of underactuated surface vessels equipped with only two propellers. The control approach exploits the inherent cascaded structure of the vehicle dynamics and is divided into control designs at the kinematics and kinetics levels. A controller with a low-gain feature is designed at the kinematics level by incorporating the cascaded system method, persistency of excitation, and the small-gain theorem. Furthermore, a PD+ controller is designed to achieve the velocity tracking at the kinetics level. The proposed control laws are partially linear and saturated linear and easy to implement. Based on a leader-follower scheme, our control approach applies to the formation tracking control problem of multi-vehicle systems under a directed spanning tree topology. Our main results guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability for the closed-loop system, which implies robustness with respect to bounded disturbances in the sense of Malkin's total stability, also known as local input-to-state stability.</description>

      <title>Reduced Network Cumulative Constraint Violation for Distributed Bandit Convex Optimization under Slater Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed bandit convex optimization problem with time-varying inequality constraints, where the goal is to minimize network regret and cumulative constraint violation. To calculate network cumulative constraint violation, existing distributed bandit online algorithms solving this problem directly use the clipped constraint function to replace its original constraint function. However, the use of the clipping operation renders Slater condition (i.e, there exists a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints at all iterations) ineffective to achieve reduced network cumulative constraint violation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new distributed bandit online primal-dual algorithm. If local loss functions are convex, we show that the proposed algorithm establishes sublinear network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. When Slater condition holds, the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced. In addition, if local loss functions are strongly convex, for the case where strongly convex parameters are unknown, the network regret bound is reduced. For the case where strongly convex parameters are known, the network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds are further reduced. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to establish reduced (network) cumulative constraint violation bounds for (distributed) bandit convex optimization with time-varying constraints under Slater condition. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Bidding in Ancillary Service Markets: An Analytical Approach Using Extreme Value Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To encourage the participation of stochastic distributed energy resources in Nordic ancillary service markets, the Danish transmission system operator, Energinet, has introduced grid codes requiring a minimum 90% reliability for the full availability of reserve capacity bids. This paper addresses the bidding strategy of flexibility aggregators under Energinet's reliability requirement by proposing a chance-constrained optimization model. An analytical solution is developed using ideas from extreme value theory, focusing on the "tail" of the empirical data used for flexibility estimation, capturing extreme events where failures are more likely to occur. The proposed model is applied to an electric vehicle aggregator participating in the Nordic market for frequency containment reserve for disturbances (FCR-D). Our results from a realistic case study show that the proposed analytical solution outperforms a commonly used sample-based approach in terms of out-of-sample constraint violation rate.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Controlled Switching Approach for Inrush Current Minimization in Power Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers are essential components for the reliable operation of power grids. The transformer core is constituted by a ferromagnetic material, and accordingly, depending on the magnetization state, the energization of the transformer can lead to high magnetizing inrush currents. Such high amplitudes shorten the life expectancy of a transformer and cause power quality issues in power grids. Various techniques have been proposed to minimize the inrush current; however, the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for this challenge has not been investigated. RL incorporates the ability to learn inrush minimization strategies adjusted to the dynamic transformer operation environment. This study proposes an inrush current minimization framework by combining controlled switching with RL. Depending on the opening angle of the circuit breaker and the remanent fluxes at disconnection, the proposed method learns the optimal closing instant of the circuit breaker. Two RL algorithms have been trained and tested through an equivalent duality-based model of a real 7.4 MVA power transformer. The evaluation of the RL algorithms is carried out with real measurement data and compared with real laboratory inrush currents. The results show that the inrush current is effectively minimized with the proposed framework.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) aiming at reconstructing the density matrix of a quantum state plays an important role in various emerging quantum technologies. Recognizing the challenges posed by imperfect measurement data, we develop a unified neural network(NN)-based approach for QST under constrained measurement scenarios, including limited measurement copies, incomplete measurements, and noisy measurements. Through comprehensive comparison with other estimation methods, we demonstrate that our method improves the estimation accuracy in scenarios with limited measurement resources, showcasing notable robustness in noisy measurement settings. These findings highlight the capability of NNs to enhance QST with constrained measurements.</description>

      <title>Tomography of Quantum States from Structured Measurements via quantum-aware transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is the process of reconstructing the state of a quantum system (mathematically described as a density matrix) through a series of different measurements, which can be solved by learning a parameterized function to translate experimentally measured statistics into physical density matrices. However, the specific structure of quantum measurements for characterizing a quantum state has been neglected in previous work. In this paper, we explore the similarity between highly structured sentences in natural language and intrinsically structured measurements in QST. To fully leverage the intrinsic quantum characteristics involved in QST, we design a quantum-aware transformer (QAT) model to capture the complex relationship between measured frequencies and density matrices. In particular, we query quantum operators in the architecture to facilitate informative representations of quantum data and integrate the Bures distance into the loss function to evaluate quantum state fidelity, thereby enabling the reconstruction of quantum states from measured data with high fidelity. Extensive simulations and experiments (on IBM quantum computers) demonstrate the superiority of the QAT in reconstructing quantum states with favorable robustness against experimental noise.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have shown great promise as hardware sources for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic switching behavior. However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.</description>

      <title>AcL: Action Learner for Fault-Tolerant Quadruped Locomotion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21401</link>

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots can learn versatile locomotion skills but remain vulnerable when one or more joints lose power. In contrast, dogs and cats can adopt limping gaits when injured, demonstrating their remarkable ability to adapt to physical conditions. Inspired by such adaptability, this paper presents Action Learner (AcL), a novel teacher-student reinforcement learning framework that enables quadrupeds to autonomously adapt their gait for stable walking under multiple joint faults. Unlike conventional teacher-student approaches that enforce strict imitation, AcL leverages teacher policies to generate style rewards, guiding the student policy without requiring precise replication. We train multiple teacher policies, each corresponding to a different fault condition, and subsequently distill them into a single student policy with an encoder-decoder architecture. While prior works primarily address single-joint faults, AcL enables quadrupeds to walk with up to four faulty joints across one or two legs, autonomously switching between different limping gaits when faults occur. We validate AcL on a real Go2 quadruped robot under single- and double-joint faults, demonstrating fault-tolerant, stable walking, smooth gait transitions between normal and lamb gaits, and robustness against external disturbances.</description>
