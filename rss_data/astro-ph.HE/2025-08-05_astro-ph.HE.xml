      <title>XRISM Observations of Cassiopeia A: Overview, Atomic Data, and Spectral Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is the youngest known core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) in the Galaxy and is perhaps the best-studied SNR in X-rays. Cas A has a line-rich spectrum dominated by thermal emission and given its high flux, it is an appealing target for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. Cas A was observed at two different locations during the Performance Verification phase of the XRISM mission, one location in the southeastern part (SE) of the remnant and one in the northwestern part (NW). This paper serves as an overview of these observations and discusses some of the issues relevant for the analysis of the data. We present maps of the so-called ``spatial-spectral mixing'' effect due to the fact that the XRISM point-spread function is larger than a pixel in the Resolve calorimeter array. We analyze spectra from two bright, on-axis regions such that the effects of spatial-spectral mixing are minimized. We find that it is critical to include redshifts/blueshifts and broadening of the emission lines in the two thermal components to achieve a reasonable fit given the high spectral resolution of the Resolve calorimeter. We fit the spectra with two versions of the AtomDB atomic database (3.0.9 and 3.1.0) and two versions of the SPEX (3.08.00 and 3.08.01*) spectral fitting software. Overall we find good agreement between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* for the spectral models considered in this paper. The most significant difference we found between AtomDB 3.0.9 and 3.1.0 and between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* is the Ni abundance, with the new atomic data favoring a considerably lower (up to a factor of 3) Ni abundance. Both regions exhibit significantly enhanced abundances compared to Solar values indicating that supernova ejecta dominate the emission in these regions. We find that the abundance ratios of Ti/Fe, Mn/Fe, \&amp; Ni/Fe are significantly lower in the NW than the SE.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent anisotropy of cosmic-ray muons: A twelve-year study with IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive, energy-resolved study of cosmic-ray muon anisotropy using 12 years (2011-2023) of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, comprising 7.92 x 10^11 events in the 13 TeV to 5.3 PeV energy range. Dividing the spectrum at log-scale energy 5 GeV, we contrast low- and high-energy anisotropy features via sidereal modulation, angular profiles, Fourier analysis, and full-sky HEALPix mapping. Gaussian and power-law fits to energy distributions are evaluated using chi-squared, reduced chi-squared, and Bayesian Information Criterion. Results show strong dipolar and large-scale anisotropy at low energies, likely due to geomagnetic and atmospheric effects, while high-energy muons display weaker, more localized structures consistent with reduced scattering and source-related anisotropy. Energy distributions are well fit by Gaussians, especially in the 6.5 to 100 bin, validating IceCube's reconstruction at PeV scales. These findings confirm energy-dependent anisotropy and support cosmic-ray diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the line-force-driven winds from active galactic nuclei: The special relativistic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01340v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) with mildly relativistic velocities are frequently observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The line-force-driving mechanism is often taken as a potential mechanism for driving UFOs. Due to the line-force-driven winds moving at mildly relativistic velocities, the special relativistic effects become important. There are two special relativistic effects: one is the influence of the disc rotation on the radiation field; the other is the radiation-drag effect. We wish to study the influence of the special relativistic effects on the line-force-driven winds, and we performed numerical simulations to investigate this. We find that the line-force-driven winds are significantly weakened when the special relativistic effects are considered. Compared with the case without special relativistic effects, when special relativistic effects are considered the winds are closer to the disc surface, the maximum speed of winds is reduced by $\sim$20 percent--70 percent, and the mass outflow rate and the kinetic power is significantly reduced.</description>

      <title>Can cosmic rays explain the high ionisation rates in the Galactic centre?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), located in the centre of the Milky Way, is a roughly cylindrical structure of molecular gas extending up to parsecs around the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. The average H2 ionisation rate in the CMZ is estimated to be 2e-14 s-1, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Galaxy. Due to the high gas density in this region, electromagnetic radiation is rapidly absorbed, leaving low-energy cosmic rays (CRs) as the only effective ionising agents. Hence, a high CR density has been invoked to explain such high ionisation rates. However, a corresponding excess in gamma rays, which would result from interactions of high-energy CRs, has not been observed. This suggests that the supposed excess exists only in the low-energy CR spectrum. To constrain this unknown low-energy component, we first derive the high-energy CR injection spectra using gamma-ray and radio data, to which we add various low-energy components. We then propagate these injection spectra by numerically solving the CR transport equation using a Crank-Nicolson scheme. Testing multiple CR injection scenarios, we find that the energy required to sustain the observed ionisation rates is excessively high in every case. We conclude that CRs cannot be the exclusive ionising agents in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Testing Gamma/Hadron Separation for Ultra-High-Energy Cherenkov Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark100 is a planned array of six telescopes, using the Panoramic Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) telescope system. It will operate as an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array, with a telescope design and array layout optimized for accessing gamma rays with tens of TeV to PeV energies. The science goals of Dark100 include the search for ultra-heavy dark matter, observations of Galactic Pevatrons, and the search for ultra-fast optical transients. Rejection of background cosmic rays is key to the sensitivity of the array. We present a first study of gamma/hadron separation based on simulated gamma rays and protons, focusing on the impact of the hadronic background models used in CORSIKA.</description>

      <title>Daily fluctuations propagate damply through a black hole accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagating fluctuations within accretion disks are known to induce multi-wavelength variability across diverse timescales. While these fluctuations have been widely invoked to explain rapid timing phenomena within the inner disk region in the frequency domain, observational signatures of outer-disk fluctuations propagating in the time domain remain sparse. Here, we present an analysis of observations by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) during the 2023 outburst of the newly discovered low-mass black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613. Follow-up, high-cadence monitoring reveals intense variability in disk emission, attributable to fluctuations in the accretion rate. These disk fluctuations exhibit damped amplitudes and shortened flare periods. We interpret these features as observational evidence of fluctuations originating at and propagating from large radii, supported by fitting the disk light curves with a propagating fluctuation model. Furthermore, we propose that a plausible mechanism driving these fluctuations is the cyclical propagation of heating and cooling fronts in the context of the disk instability model. This work bridges theoretical predictions with time-domain observations, offering critical insights into the dynamic processes governing accretion disks.</description>

      <title>SN 2024gy: Multi-epoch Spectroscopic Evidence for Delayed Detonation in a Type Ia Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024gy, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting high-velocity features (HVFs) in its early-time spectra. This SN reaches a peak $B$-band magnitude of $-19.25 \pm 0.28$ mag and subsequently declines by $\Delta m_{15}(B) \approx 1.12$ mag, consistent with the luminosity-width relation characteristic of normal SNe Ia. Based on the peak thermal luminosity of $(1.2 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we estimate that $0.57 \pm 0.14~\rm M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized during the explosion. Our dense early spectral monitoring revealed significant velocity disparities within the ejecta. Notably, absorption features from the \CaII\ near-infrared triplet were observed at velocities exceeding 25,000 km s$^{-1}$, while the \SiII\, \ld 6355 line velocity at the same epoch was significantly lower at $\sim$ 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. This velocity disparity likely reflects distinct ionization states of intermediate-mass elements in the outermost layers. The prominent \CaII\, HVFs may originate from ionization suppression within the highest-velocity ejecta, potentially indicative of minimal hydrogen mixing in a delayed-detonation explosion scenario. Additionally, the Ni/Fe ratio derived from the nebular spectrum of SN 2024gy provides further support for this model.</description>

      <title>A fast radio burst from the first 3 billion years of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic millisecond-duration signals which encode otherwise unattainable information on the plasma which permeates our Universe, providing insights into magnetic fields and gas distributions. Here we report the discovery of FRB 20240304B originating at redshift 2.148 +/- 0.001 corresponding to just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. FRB 2024030 was detected with the MeerKAT radio telescope and localized to a low-mass, clumpy, star forming galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery doubles the redshift reach of localized FRBs and probes ionized baryons across ~80% of cosmic history. Its sightline, intersecting the Virgo Cluster and a foreground group, reveals magnetic field complexity over many gigaparsec scales. Our observations establish FRB activity during the peak of cosmic star formation and demonstrate that FRBs can probe galaxy formation during the most active era in cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Rotational evolution of deformed magnetized neutron stars: implications for obliquity distribution and braking indices statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational evolution of a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS), accreting or isolated, is driven by external torques of different nature. In addition to the torques, even the tiniest deformations of the NS crust can affect its rotation through asymmetries in its inertia tensor. Several factors may be responsible for the deformations, including strong magnetic fields, internal stresses, or local heating. The main effect produced by the deformations is the so-called free precession: the motion of the rotational axis with respect to the crust. We consider the evolution of a triaxially deformed isolated NS with a strong dipolar magnetic field for a broad range of parameters, taking into account the magnetic field decay. We show that the combination of pulsar torques and free precession results in a considerable broadening of the distribution of magnetic obliquity angles (the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes) and creates a population of objects where the rotational axis does not align with the magnetic axis at all but enters a limit-cycle regime. The combination of free precession and magnetic torques can also explain the observed distribution in pulsar braking indices by creating a periodic oscillation in the magnetic obliquity.</description>

      <title>Revealing a ribbon-like jet in OJ 287 with RadioAstron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present space-based very long baseline interferometry observations of the BL Lac type object OJ 287 taken with RadioAstron at 22 GHz on April 25, 2016, in conjunction with a ground array comprising 27 radio telescopes. We detect ground-space fringes at projected baselines extending up to 4.6 Earth diameters, which allowed us to image the jet in OJ 287 with an angular resolution of ~47 {\mu}as. Applying an advanced regularized maximum likelihood imaging method, we resolved the innermost jet structure with a complex morphology at a resolution of ~15 {\mu}as (~0.1 pc projected distance). For the first time, due to a favorable geometrical position of the jet in tandem with high data quality, we detect multiple sharp bends that form a "ribbon-like" jet structure that extends down to 1 mas. Two-dimensional Gaussian model-fitting reveals regions of the jet with brightness temperatures of more than 10^13 K, indicative of strong Doppler boosting. Polarimetric imaging reveals that the electric vector position angles are predominantly perpendicular to the innermost jet direction, implying a dominant poloidal magnetic field component near the central engine. Complementary multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array observations at 43 GHz provide a multifrequency view of the jet evolution. Ridgeline analysis of the 43 GHz data shows significant variations in the jet position angle from 2014 to 2017, behavior consistent with a rotating helical jet structure. Finally, we confirm the emergence of a new jet component (B15 or K), which may be associated with the source's first TeV flare, and offer new observational constraints relevant to models involving a supermassive black hole binary.</description>

      <title>Using Faded Changing-Look Quasars to Unveil the Spectral Energy Distribution Evolution of Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of accretion flows in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at low Eddington ratios (~10^-2 to 10^-3) are poorly-understood, and can be probed using the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of faded changing-look (CL) quasars. Previous results using single-epoch X-ray and rest-frame UV observations of samples of faded CL quasars suggest that their SED properties at low Eddington ratios display similarities to X-ray binaries fading from outburst. However, more robust tests demand multi-epoch observations that can trace the temporal behavior of the SEDs of individual AGN at low Eddington ratios. Here, we perform this test, by obtaining a second epoch of UV and X-ray observations of a sample of three faded CL quasars with bolometric Eddington ratios of &lt;10^-3, using a combination of contemporaneous HST UV imaging, Chandra X-ray observations, and optical spectroscopy. We find that all three CL quasars varied in luminosity, and their optical-to-X-ray spectral indices alpha_OX all individually display a negative (harder-when-brighter) correlation with Eddington ratio. This SED evolution is also often observed in X-ray binaries at low Eddington ratios, and adds to the growing evidence that AGN accretion flows behave analogously to X-ray binaries across all accretion states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source LHAASO J2108$+$5157, utilizing VERITAS, HAWC, \emph{Fermi}-LAT, and \textit{XMM-Newton}. VERITAS has collected $\sim$ 40 hours of data that we used to set ULs to the emission above 200 GeV. The HAWC data, collected over $\sim 2400$ days, reveal emission between 3 and 146 TeV, with a significance of $7.5~\sigma$, favoring an extended source model. The best-fit spectrum measured by HAWC is characterized by a simple power-law with a spectral index of $2.45\pm0.11_{stat}$. \emph{Fermi}-LAT analysis finds a point source with a very soft spectrum in the LHAASO J2108+5157 region, consistent with the 4FGL-DR3 catalog results. The \textit{XMM-Newton} analysis yields a null detection of the source in the 2 - 7 keV band. The broadband spectrum can be interpreted as a pulsar and a pulsar wind nebula system, where the GeV gamma-ray emission originates from an unidentified pulsar, and the X-ray and TeV emission is attributed to synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of electrons accelerated within a pulsar wind nebula. In this leptonic scenario, our X-ray upper limit provides a stringent constraint on the magnetic field, which is $\lesssim 1.5\ \mu$G.</description>

      <title>On the origin of a possible hard VHE spectrum from M87 discovered by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent LHAASO observations hint at potential spectral hardening around 20 TeV in M87's very high energy (VHE) emission, suggesting a possible new radiation component. In this work, we construct averaged multiwavelength SEDs by combining data from Chandra and Swift-UVOT/XRT covering the same period as the LHAASO detection to investigate the origin of this feature. We test several radiation mechanisms, including the pp interaction, proton synchrotron emission, photomeson process and two-zone leptonic model. We find that only the pion decay gamma rays in pp interactions can interpret this feature in the framework of the one-zone model. With analytical analysis, we prove that proton synchrotron emission cannot generate a hard spectrum above 0.17~TeV. For photomeson model, it requires an emission zone compressed near the Schwarzschild radius of the central supermassive black hole, incompatible with broadband optical-GeV spectral constraints. In addition, the two-zone leptonic model also emerges as a viable alternative.</description>

      <title>$\nu p$-process in Core-Collapse Supernovae: Imprints of General Relativistic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.</description>

      <title>Effect of magnetic field inclination on black hole jet power and particle acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating black holes are known to launch relativistic jets and accelerate particles provided they accrete a magnetized plasma. However, it remains unclear how the global magnetic field orientation affects the jet powering efficiency. Here, we propose the first kinetic study of a collisionless plasma around a Kerr black hole that is embedded in a magnetic field inclined with respect to the black hole's spin axis. Using three-dimensional general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations, we show that while oblique magnetic field configurations significantly reduce the jet power, particle acceleration remains highly efficient regardless. This suggests that black holes producing a weak jet could still be bright sources of nonthermal radiation and cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of X-ray Sources in Terzan 5 Using Chandra Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze photometry, spectra, and variability of over 100 faint X-ray sources in the globular cluster Terzan 5, using 737 ks of Chandra data. X-ray colors and spectral fitting allow clear separation of foreground sources (with less extinction than the cluster), quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs), and sources with harder spectra. We identify 22 candidate qLMXBs, over twice that found in any other cluster. This is consistent with Terzan 5's stellar interaction rate, the highest among Galactic globular clusters. We do not see qLMXBs dominated by thermal emission below $L_X\sim10^{32}$ erg/s, though qLMXBs with stronger nonthermal emission could be missed. We find that more than 50 % of the qLMXB sources have neutron star thermal component contributing over 80 % of the total luminosity. We report an unusual spectral feature around 1.75 keV in the combined spectrum of Ter 5 X-3. The concentration of the qLMXBs within the cluster is consistent with that of a population of mass $1.46 \pm 0.14$ M$_\odot$. We identify secure X-ray counterparts to millisecond pulsars Terzan 5 ar and Terzan 5 at, using positional coincidence and orbital X-ray light curves matching those expected for spider pulsars.</description>

      <title>Energy flow and radiation efficiency in radiative GRMHD simulations of neutron star ultraluminous X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the energy flow and radiation efficiency of accreting neutron stars as potential ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We perform ten simulations {in radiative general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD)}, exploring six different magnetic dipole strengths ranging from 10 to 100 GigaGauss, along with three accretion rates, 100, 300, and 1000 Eddington luminosity units. Our results show that the energy efficiency in simulations with a strong magnetic dipole of 100 GigaGauss is approximately half that of simulations with a magnetic dipole an order of magnitude weaker. Consequently, radiation efficiency is lower in simulations with stronger magnetic dipoles. We also demonstrate that outflow power increases as the magnetic dipole weakens, resulting in stronger beaming in simulations with weaker magnetic dipoles. As a result of beaming, simulations with magnetic dipole strengths below 30 GigaGauss exhibit apparent luminosities consistent with those observed in ULXs. As for the accretion rates, we find that higher accretion rates lead to more powerful outflows, higher kinetic efficiency, and lower radiation efficiency compared to those of lower accretion rate simulations.</description>

      <title>PSR J0614-3329: A NICER case for Strange Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of neutron star masses and radii by the NICER mission impose important constraints on the nuclear equation of state. The most recent NICER measurement of PSR J0614-3329 reported an equatorial radius of $R_{eq} = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km for a mass of $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_{\odot}$. Considering all the NICER measurements to date, we demonstrate using Bayesian hypothesis ranking that strange quark stars are preferred over all the physically motivated models of neutron stars compatible with this low radius. This provides a strong case for the possible existence of strange quark stars, suggesting that they should be considered among the population of compact stars during analyses of astrophysical data. Using a wide sample of equations of state, we report the nucleonic equations of state that best fit current observations and rule out one model of strange quark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment (AMDM) $a_\mu$ provides an opportunity for constraining the exotic interactions between muons mediated by new scalar or vector particles. Recent progress in both experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of the muon AMDM has reconciled the long-standing tension between them. Based on the latest result for the muon AMDM, $\Delta a_\mu =a^{\rm exp}_\mu-a^{\rm SM}_\mu= (38 \pm 63) \times 10^{-11}$, we derive updated constraints on exotic interactions between muons.</description>

      <title>A Census of Variable Radio Sources at $3\,$GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of phenomena, from explosive transients to active galactic nuclei, exhibit variability at radio wavelengths on timescales of a few years. Characterizing the rate and scale of variability in the radio sky can provide keen insights into dynamic processes in the Universe, such as accretion mechanics, jet propagation, and stellar evolution. We use data from the first two epochs of the Very Large Array Sky Survey to conduct a census of the variable radio sky. Approximately $3,600$ objects are found to significantly vary in brightness during the $\sim2.5\,$ years between observations. For compact sources whose mean flux density across the two epochs, $\mu_{S}$, is brighter than $20\,$mJy, $\approx 5\,$% show brightness variations $&gt;30\,$%, rising to $\approx 9\,$% at $\mu_{S}&gt;300\,$mJy. Most of the VLASS variables have multiwavelength properties consistent with blazars and quasars, including those with the largest absolute changes in flux density. The largest fractional changes in brightness are exhibited by galactic sources. We discuss our results, including some of the more interesting and extreme examples of variable radio sources identified, as well as future research directions.</description>

      <title>Complementary Planetary Spectroscopy Probes of Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM) interactions via spectroscopic signatures of energy injection in planetary environments. We develop a general framework to account for how DM energy injection signals depend on the DM spatial distribution, planetary structure, and DM energy deposition profile. We combine UV airglow data on the Solar System's gas giants from the Voyager and New Horizons flybys, and ionospheric measurements from AMS-02 and ELFIN CubeSat on Earth, with internal heat flow data from Cassini, Voyager, and terrestrial boreholes, to constrain DM-nucleon scattering across both heavy and light mediator scenarios. We show that Earth, gas giants, and ice giants probe complementary DM masses and mediator properties, and forecast the reach of a free-floating Super-Jupiter. These results establish planetary spectroscopy as a powerful and versatile probe of the dark sector, complementary to direct detection, cosmology, and collider searches.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulation of Odd Radio Circles as Merger-Driven Shocks in Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of distinct radio objects that has recently been discovered. The origin of these features is yet unclear because their peculiar properties are a challenge for our current understanding of astrophysical sources for diffuse radio emission. In this work we test the feasibility of major mergers in galaxy groups as a possible formation channel for ORCs. By modeling the assembly of a massive galaxy group with a final virial mass of $M_{200}\sim 10^{13}\, \rm M_\odot$ in a magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulation with on-the-fly cosmic ray treatment, we are able to derive the X-ray and radio properties of the system self-consistently and compare them to observations. We show that the X-ray properties for the simulated system are agreeing with characteristics of observed galaxy groups in the regarded mass range, legitimating the comparison between the radio properties of the simulated halo and those of observed ORCs. A major merger between two galaxies in the simulation is triggering a series of strong shocks in the circumgalactic medium, which in unison are forming a ring if the line of sight is perpendicular to the merger axis. The shock is rapidly expanding in radial direction and quickly reaches the virial radius of the halo. This formation channel can hence readily explain the morphology and large extent of ORCs. However, the inferred radio luminosity of these features is lower than for observed counterparts, while the degree of polarization seems to be systematically overpredicted by the simulation. Fossil cosmic ray populations from AGN and stellar feedback might be necessary to explain the full extent of the radio properties of ORCs, since diffusive shock acceleration was the only source term for non-thermal electrons considered in this work.</description>

      <title>GW231123 Formation from Population III Stars: Isolated Binary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is a merger of two black holes (BHs) whose inferred masses exceed $100\;{\rm M}_\odot$ typically; they are the most massive BHs among those discovered by gravitational wave (GW) observations. We examine if GW231123-like events can be formed from isolated Population (Pop) III binary stars by means of binary population synthesis calculations. We find that Pop III isolated binary stars can create GW231123-like events at a rate large enough to explain the discovery of GW231123, if two conditions are satisfied. First, Pop III stars evolve with inefficient convective overshooting, and second the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ rate is $2\sigma$ lower than the standard value. On the other hand, GW190521, which is the most massive BHs in Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog 3, can be formed from isolated Pop III binary stars even if the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ rate is the standard value. We reveal that the discovery of GW231123 is progressively putting constraints on possible parameter ranges of single star evolution models, assuming that all the GW events are formed through isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Challenging Classical Paradigms: Recurrent Nova M31N 2017-01e, a BeWD system in M31?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M31N 2017-01e is the second-fastest recurrent nova known, with a recurrence period of 2.5 years in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). This system exhibits a unique combination of properties: a low outburst amplitude ($\sim3$ magnitude), starkly contrasting with known recurrent novae (typically $\geq 6$ magnitudes), and a very fast evolution ($t_{2}\sim 5 $ days). Its position coincides with a bright variable source ($\mathrm{{M_V \sim -4.2,\, B-V= 0.042}}$) displaying a 14.3 day photometric modulation, which has been suggested as the likely progenitor.
  We present a multi-wavelength analysis of optical and UV data spanning quiescence and the 2019 and 2024 outbursts. Archival high-resolution imaging reveals two nearby faint sources within $5^{\prime\prime}$ of the proposed nova system, which we identified as unrelated field stars. Color analysis and spectral energy distribution fitting suggest the progenitor is likely an early-type star. Combined with archival spectra consistent with a B-type star with H$\alpha$ in emission, this points to the quiescent counterpart being a Be star with a circumstellar disc.
  We propose that M31N 2017-01e arises from a rare Be-WD binary, where the WD accretes from the decretion disk of its companion, explaining its rapid recurrence, low-amplitude outbursts, and unusual quiescent luminosity and color. This analysis highlights M31N 2017-01e as a compelling outlier among recurrent novae, suggesting a distinct accretion mechanism and evolutionary path that challenges the prevailing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\,2024ggi from 250 and 420 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \text{\AA} doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\approx 14$ M$_\odot$. This value is consistent with $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \ion{Mg}{1} and [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at $2.3$ $\mu$m from 250 to 319 days in the NIR.</description>

      <title>Indication for a compact object next to a LIGO-Virgo binary black hole merger</title>

Abstract: The astrophysical origin of binary black hole (BBH) mergers remains uncertain, although many events have been observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. Such mergers are potentially originated in the vicinity of massive black holes (MBHs). GW190814, due to its secondary mass and mass ratio being beyond the expectations of isolated stellar evolution theories, is a promising event that has occurred in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. In this model, a compact object resides in the vicinity of a merging BBH. Here we report multiple pieces of evidence suggesting that GW190814 is a BBH merging near a compact object. The orbital motion of BBHs around a third body produces a line-of-sight acceleration (LSA) and induces a varying Doppler shift. Using a waveform template that considers LSA, we perform Bayesian inference on a few BBH events with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the gravitational-wave (GW) transient catalog. Compared to the model for isolated BBH mergers, we obtain significantly higher network signal-to-noise ratios for GW190814 with the inclusion of LSA, constraining the LSA to $a = 0.0015^{+0.0008}_{-0.0008} ~c~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at a $90 \%$ confidence level. Additionally, the Bayes factor for the LSA case over the isolated case is $58/1$, indicating that the GW data strongly prefer the LSA model. We conclude that this is the first indication showing merging BBHs are located near a third compact object.</description>

      <title>Study of the IC 443 region with the HAWC observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova remnants are one potential source class considered a PeVatron (i.e. capable of accelerating cosmic rays above PeV energies). The shock fronts produced after the explosion of the supernova are ideal regions for particle acceleration. IC 443 is a supernova remnant that has been studied extensively at different wavelengths. Using 2966 days of gamma-ray data from the HAWC observatory, we study the emission of IC 443 with the objective of finding signatures of cosmic-ray acceleration at the PeV scale. Using a maximum likelihood method, we find a point source located at ($\alpha$=94.42$^{\circ}$, $\delta$=22.35$^{\circ}$) that we associate with IC 443. The measured spectrum is a simple power law with an index of $-3.14\pm$0.18, which is consistent with previous TeV observations. Although we cannot confirm that IC 443 is a hadronic PeVatron, we do not find any sign that the spectrum has a cut off at tens of TeV energies, with the spectrum extending to $\sim$30 TeV. Furthermore, we also find a new extended component in the region whose emission is described by a simple power law with an index of $-2.49\pm$0.08 and which we call HAWC J0615+2213. While we show evidence that this new source might be a new TeV halo, we defer a detailed analysis of this new source to another publication.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectra from General Relativistic RMHD Simulations of Thin Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare X-ray emission from several general relativistic, multi-frequency, radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thin black hole accretion disks with different accretion rates and spins. The simulations were performed using the M1 closure scheme, resolved with twelve frequency (energy) bins logarithmically spaced from $5 \times 10^{-3}$ to $5 \times 10^3$ keV. We apply a general relativistic Monte Carlo transport code to post-process the simulation data with greater fidelity in frequency resolution and Compton scattering treatment. Despite the relatively few energy bins and Kompaneets approximation to Compton scattering utilized in the M1 method, we find generally good agreement between the methods. Both produce prominent thermal profiles with peaks around 2 - 2.5 keV, where agreement is particularly strong and representative of the soft state. Both also find weaker (lower luminosity) thermally sourced emission extending out to 100 keV due to the hotter innermost regions of the disks. Inverse Compton scattering becomes increasingly effective at hardening spectral outputs with increasing black hole spin, and becomes the dominant mechanism for photons that escape with energies between 10 to several hundred keV. At very high rates of spin the radiation flux in this upscattered component becomes comparable to the thermal flux, a phenomenon typically associated with intermediate states. Beyond $10^4$ keV, we observe faint, free-free emission from hot, optically thin coronal regions developing near the horizon, common to both spinning and nonspinning black holes.</description>

Abstract: We present the first numerical relativity simulations including neutrino flavor transformations that could result from flavor instabilities, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics in neutron star mergers. We find that neutrino flavor transformations impact the composition and structure of the remnant, potentially leaving an imprint on the post-merger gravitational-wave signal. They also have a significant impact on the composition and nucleosynthesis yields of the ejecta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the first eight months of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run, denoted O4a. We use four analyses which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals lasting up to a few seconds in the 16-4096 Hz band. Excluding binary black hole merger candidates that were already identified by low-latency analyses, we find no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational-wave transients. We measure the sensitivity of the search for representative signals, including sine-Gaussians, Gaussian pulses, and white-noise bursts with different frequencies and durations, adopting a false alarm rate of 1 per 100 years as detection threshold. Depending on signal type, we find improvements over previous searches by factors of 2 to 10 in terms of sensitivity to strain amplitude and of 90% confidence upper limit on the rate density of sources. We also evaluate a variety of core-collapse supernova models and find that, for some models, the search could have detected gravitational waves from stellar core-collapse throughout the Milky Way. Finally, we consider neutron star f-modes associated with pulsar glitches and find that, assuming a source similar to the Vela Pulsar, the search could have detected a gravitational-wave signal from a glitch with fractional frequency change as small as $\sim 2$ to $6 \times 10^{-5}$ depending on the neutron star mass.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of the Energy and Redshift Distributions of the Fast Radio Burst Population Based on the First CHIME/FRB Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, high-energy bursts of radio waves from extragalactic sources, and their origin remains an open question. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distribution, with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the Schechter function, with a power-law index of $\gamma = -1.49^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$ and a characteristic cutoff energy of $E_\mathrm{c} = 2.82^{+2.43}_{-1.47} \times 10^{41}$ erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the energy distribution of FRBs. In terms of their redshift distribution, our analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a local volumetric rate of $\Phi_0 = 4.68^{+4.66}_{-2.39} \times 10^{4} \rm \ Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for $E&gt;10^{39}$ erg. These results, robust against CHIME observational biases, may provide new insights into the underlying properties of the FRB population.</description>

      <title>Composite asymmetric dark matter with a dark photon portal: Multimessenger tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composite asymmetric dark matter (ADM) is the framework that naturally explains the coincidence of the baryon density and the dark matter density of the Universe. Through a portal interaction sharing particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the Standard Model and dark sectors, dark matter particles, which are dark-sector counterparts of baryons, can decay into antineutrinos and dark-sector counterparts of mesons (dark mesons) or dark photon. Subsequent cascade decay of the dark mesons and the dark photon can also provide electromagnetic fluxes at late times of the Universe. The cosmic-ray constraints on the decaying dark matter with the mass of $1$--$10$~GeV has not been well studied. We perform comprehensive studies on the decay of the composite ADM by combining the astrophysical constraints from $e^\pm$ and $\gamma$-ray. The constraints from cosmic-ray positron measurements by AMS-02 are the most stringent at $\gtrsim2$~GeV: a lifetime should be larger than the order of $10^{26}$~s, corresponding to the cutoff scale of the portal interaction of about $10^8 \text{--} 10^9 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. We also perform the dedicated analysis for the neutrino monoenergetic signals at Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande due to the atmospheric neutrino background in the energy range of our interest.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Audio Transformer as a Foundational AI Tool for Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As gravitational wave detectors become more advanced and sensitive, the number of signals recorded by Advanced LIGO and Virgo from merging compact objects is expected to rise dramatically. This surge in detection rates necessitates the development of adaptable, scalable, and efficient tools capable of addressing a wide range of tasks in gravitational wave astronomy. Foundational AI models present a transformative opportunity in this context by providing a unified framework that can be fine tuned for diverse applications while leveraging the power of large scale pre training. In this work, we explore how advanced transformer models, specifically Whisper by OpenAI, can be adapted as a foundational model for gravitational wave data analysis. By fine tuning the encoder model of Whisper, originally trained on extensive audio data, and combining it with neural networks for specialized tasks, we achieve reliable results in detecting astrophysical signals and classifying transient noise artifacts or glitches. This represents the first application of open source transformer models, pre trained on unrelated tasks, for gravitational wave research, demonstrating their potential to enable versatile and efficient data analysis in the era of rapidly increasing detection rates.</description>

      <title>Gravity as emergent phenomena for spherically symmetric black hole accretion of multi-component flow with relativistic equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate analogue gravity phenomena arising as a result of the linear perturbation of the spherically symmetric accretion flows onto non rotating black holes, where the gravitational field is determined by a set of post Newtonian pseudo Schwarzschild black hole potentials and the infaling matter is described by a relativistic multi-species equation of state. The stationary transonic integral accretion solutions corresponding to the steady state of aforementioned type of accreting systems are constructed and the stability analysis of such solutions are performed through the time dependent linear perturbation of the accretion flow. Such linear stability analysis leads to the formation of a black hole like sonic metric embedded within the infalling matter. The acoustic horizons are then identified by constructing the causal structure, i.e., the Carter-Penrose diagrams. The variation of the analogue surface gravity corresponding to the aforementioned sonic metric has been studied as a function of various parameters governing the accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Evolution of precessing binary black holes on eccentric orbits using orbit-averaged evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most general bound binary black hole (BBH) system has an eccentric orbit and precessing spins. The detection of such a system with significant eccentricity close to the merger would be a clear signature of dynamical formation. In order to study such systems, it is important to be able to evolve their spins and eccentricity from the larger separations at which the binary formed to the smaller separations at which it is detected, or vice versa. Knowledge of the precessional evolution of the binary's orbital angular momentum can also be used to twist up aligned-spin eccentric waveform models to create a spin-precessing eccentric waveform model. In this paper, we present a new publicly available code to evolve eccentric, precessing BBHs using orbit-averaged post-Newtonian (PN) equations from the literature. The spin-precession dynamics is 2PN accurate, i.e., with the leading spin-orbit and spin-spin corrections. The evolution of orbital parameters (orbital frequency, eccentricity, and periastron precession), which follow the quasi-Keplerian parametrization, is 3PN accurate in the point particle terms and includes the leading order spin-orbit and spin-spin effects. All the spin-spin terms include the quadrupole-monopole interaction. The eccentricity enhancement functions in the fluxes use the high-accuracy hyperasymptotic expansions from Loutrel and Yunes [Classical Quantum Gravity {\bf 34} 044003 (2017)]. We discuss various features of the code and study the evolution of the orbital and spin-precession parameters of eccentric, precessing BBHs. In particular, we study the dependence of the spin morphologies on eccentricity, where we find that the transition point from one spin morphology to another can depend nonmonotonically on eccentricity, and the fraction of binaries in a given morphology at a given point in the evolution of a population depends on the instantaneous eccentricity.</description>

Abstract: The COMPAS public rapid binary population synthesis code has undergone a number of key improvements since the original COMPAS methods paper (Team COMPAS: Riley et al., 2022) was published. These include more sophisticated and robust treatments of binary interactions: mass transfer physics, common-envelope events, tides and gravitational-wave radiation reaction; and updated prescriptions for stellar evolution, winds and supernovae. The code structure and outputs have also been updated, with a focus on improving resolution without sacrificing computational speed. This paper describes the substantive changes in the code between the previous methods paper and COMPAS v03.22.01.</description>

      <title>Rotating Supermassive Pop III Stars On The Main Sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\Omega\Gamma$ limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* &lt; 0.1$ for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.</description>
