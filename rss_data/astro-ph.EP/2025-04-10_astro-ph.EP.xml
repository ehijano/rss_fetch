      <title>Positive Feedback II: How Dust Coagulation inside Vortices Can Form Planetesimals at Low Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of planetesimals ($\sim$100 km planet building blocks) has confounded astronomers for decades, as numerous growth barriers appear to impede their formation. In a recent paper we proposed a novel interaction where the streaming instability (SI) and dust coagulation work in tandem, with each one changing the environment in a way that benefits the other. This mechanism proved effective at forming planetesimals in the fragmentation-limited inner disk, but much less effective in the drift-limited outer disk, concluding that dust traps may be key to forming planets at wide orbital separations. Here we explore a different hypothesis: That vortices host a feedback loop in which a vortex traps dust, boosting dust coagulation, which in turn boosts vortex trapping. We combine an analytic model of vortex trapping with an analytic model of fragmentation limited grain growth that accounts for how dust concentration dampens gas turbulence. We find a powerful synergy between vortex trapping and dust growth. For $\alpha \le 10^{-3}$ and solar-like metallicity this feedback loop consistently takes the grain size and dust density into the planetesimal formation region of the streaming instability (SI). Only in the regime of strong turbulence ($\alpha \ge 3\times 10^{-3}$) does the system often converge to a steady state below the SI criterion. The combination of vortex trapping with dust coagulation is an even more powerful mechanism than the one involving the SI. It is effective at lower metallicity and across the whole disk -- anywhere that vortices form.</description>

      <title>The likelihood of not detecting cavity-carving companions in transition discs -- A statistical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary discs with cavities, also known as ``transition discs'', constitute ~10% of protoplanetary discs at sub-mm wavelengths. Among several explanations, one hypothesis suggests these cavities are carved by undetected stellar or planetary companions. We present a novel approach to quantify the likelihood that a cavity-carving companion goes undetected because it is either too close to the star (i.e., has a small projected separation) or too faint to be resolved. We generate two independent samples of stellar and planetary companions with random sky orientations, assuming distributions in eccentricity, mass ratio, and time-weighted orbital phases, to study the statistical properties of the cavities they produce. We calculate the likelihood that a companion appears with a projected separation $d$ relative to its semi-major axis $a_{bin}$ ($d/a_{bin}$). Then, using a disc truncation model, we calculate the likelihood that companions carve a cavity with size $a_{cav}$ relative to its semi-major axis $a_{bin}$ and projected separation $d$, deriving distributions of $a_{bin}/a_{cav}$ and $d/a_{cav}$. We find that stellar companions carve cavities with median sizes ~3 times larger than their projected separation $d$ ($a_{cav}\sim3d$, $a_{cav}\sim1.7 d$ for planets), but with a statistically significant tail towards larger values ($a_{cav}\gg 3d$). We estimate the likelihood that cavity-carving companions go undetected due to projection effects when the system is observed with spatial resolution $R$, $P(d&lt; R)$. Considering observational constraints on companion masses, we apply this framework to 13 well-known transition discs. We find that undetected stellar companions are unlikely in 8 out of 13 systems we considered, with 5 notable exceptions: ABAur, MWC758, HD135344B, CQTau and HD169142. The presence of undetected planets cannot be excluded in any of the transition discs considered.</description>

      <title>MOA-2010-BLG-328: Keck and HST Expose the Limits of Occams Razor in Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high resolution follow-up data of the planetary microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-328, using Keck and the Hubble. Keck data, taken 8 years after the event, reveal a strong lens detection enabling a direct measurement of lens flux and source-lens relative proper motion. We find the relative source-lens proper motion to be $\mu_{\rm rel, Hel} = 4.07 \pm 0.34\ \rm mas\ yr^{-1}$, with the lens being $\sim10$ times fainter than the source. The lens was very faint in the Hubble passbands, and the small lens-source separation of $\sim$35 mas made its detection difficult. However, we obtained estimates of the lens magnitudes in Hubble bands by constraining its location to match the Keck K-band detection. The original analysis by \citet{Furusawa2013} reports a degenerate light curve, with several viable models depending on higher-order effects. We attempt to break the degeneracy by remodeling the event using constraints from follow-up data. Our best fit model includes parallax, orbital motion, xallarap and the magnification of a source companion. Models omitting any of these are excluded. However, even with a lens detection the solution remains unclear, as the degeneracy between a nearby late M dwarf and a distant early M dwarf in the disk persists, and cannot be broken with NIR data alone. We conclude the lens is either a $\sim0.2\ M_{\odot}$ star at $2-3$kpc, or a $\sim0.5\ M_{\odot}$ star at $4-5$kpc. This study highlights the importance of multi-band data and comprehensive modeling to resolve microlensing degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Photobombing for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). A new criterion for target confusion and application to a MIR rotating nulling interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary objectives in modern astronomy is to discover and study planets with characteristics similar to Earth. This pursuit involves analyzing the spectra of exoplanets and searching for biosignatures. Contamination of spectra by nearby objects (e.g., other planets and moons in the same system) is a significant concern and must be addressed for future exo-Earth searching missions. The aim is to estimate, for habitable planets, the probability of spectral contamination by other planets within the same star system. This investigation focuses on the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). Since the Rayleigh criterion is inapplicable to interferometers such as those proposed for LIFE, we present new criteria based on the principle of parsimony, which take into account two types of issues: contamination or blending of point sources, and cancellation of point sources due to destructive interference. We define a new spatial resolution metric associated with contamination or cancellation that generalizes to a broader family of observing instruments. In the current baseline design, LIFE is an X-array architecture nulling interferometer. Our investigation reveals that its transmission map introduces the potential for two point sources to appear as one, even if they do not appear in close proximity. We find that LIFE has a spatial resolution comparable to that of a traditional telescope with a diameter of $D = 600\,\text{m}$, observing at $\lambda = 4 \,\mu\text{m}$. Our survey of a star system population shows that, out of 73.4 expected habitable planets detected, 71.3 are not contaminated on average.</description>

      <title>What if we find nothing? Bayesian analysis of the statistical information of null results in future exoplanet habitability and biosignature surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future telescopes will survey temperate, terrestrial exoplanets to estimate the frequency of habitable ($\eta_{\text{Hab}}$) or inhabited ($\eta_{\text{Life}}$) planets. This study aims to determine the minimum number of planets ($N$) required to draw statistically significant conclusions, particularly in the case of a null result (i.e., no detections). Using a Bayesian framework, we analyzed surveys of up to $N=100$ planets to infer the frequency of a binary observable feature ($\eta_{\text{obs}}$) after null results. Posterior best fits and upper limits were derived for various survey sizes and compared with predicted yields from missions like the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Our findings indicate that $N=20-50$ ``perfect'' observations (100\% confidence in detecting or excluding the feature) yield conclusions relatively independent of priors. To achieve 99.9\% upper limits of $\eta_{\text{obs}} \leq 0.2/0.1$, approximately $N \simeq 40/80$ observations are needed. For ``imperfect'' observations, uncertainties in interpretation and sample biases become limiting factors. We show that LIFE and HWO aim for sufficiently large survey sizes to provide statistically meaningful estimates of habitable environments and life prevalence under these assumptions. However, robust conclusions require careful sample selection and high-confidence detection or exclusion of features in each observation.</description>

      <title>TOI-6478 b: a cold under-dense Neptune transiting a fully convective M dwarf from the thick disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing numbers of exoplanet detections continue to reveal the diverse nature of planetary systems. Planet formation around late-type M dwarfs is of particular interest. These systems provide practical laboratories to measure exoplanet occurrence rates for M dwarfs, thus testing how the outcomes of planet formation scale with host mass, and how they compare to Sun-like stars. Here, we report the discovery of TOI-6478b, a cold ($T_{\text{eq}}=204\,$K) Neptune-like planet orbiting an M5 star ($R_\star=0.234\pm0.012\,\text{R}_\odot$, $M_\star=0.230\pm0.007\,\text{M}_\odot$, $T_{\text{eff}}=3230\pm75\,$K) which is a member of the Milky Way's thick disc. We measure a planet radius of $R_b=4.6\pm0.24\,\text{R}_\oplus$ on a $P_b=34.005019\pm0.000025\,$d orbit. Using radial velocities, we calculate an upper mass limit of $M_b\leq9.9\,\text{M}_\oplus$ ($M_b\leq0.6\,\text{M}_{\text{Nep}})$, with $3\,\sigma$ confidence. TOI-6478b is a milestone planet in the study of cold, Neptune-like worlds. Thanks to its large atmospheric scale height, it is amenable to atmospheric characterisation with facilities such as JWST, and will provide an excellent probe of atmospheric chemistry in this cold regime. It is one of very few transiting exoplanets that orbit beyond their system's ice-line whose atmospheric chemical composition can be measured. Based on our current understanding of this planet, we estimate TOI-6478b's spectroscopic features (in transmission) can be $\sim2.5\times$ as high as the widely studied planet K2-18b.</description>

      <title>Combining high-contrast imaging with high-resolution spectroscopy: Actual on-sky MIRI/MRS results compared to expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CONTEXT: Combining high-contrast imaging with high-resolution spectroscopy offers a powerful way to detect and characterize exoplanets around nearby stars, despite challenges linked to their faintness. Instruments like VLT/SPHERE are state of the art in high-contrast imaging, but their spectral resolution (R=50) limits them to basic characterization of close companions. These systems can detect planets down to 5-10 Mjup at 10 AU from their stars. Detection limits are mainly constrained by speckle noise, which dominates over photon and detector noise at short separations, even with advanced differential imaging. Space-based high-contrast imaging is also limited by image stability. Speckle noise can, however, be mitigated through molecular mapping, a technique that leverages high-resolution spectroscopic data.
  AIMS: We aim to predict detection limits in spectro-imaging after molecular mapping, analyzing how photon and detector noise propagate and comparing predictions with real data to assess performance losses from instrumental effects. We also propose mitigation strategies and validate our model using observations.
  METHODS: We analyzed JWST/MIRI/MRS data with FastCurves, an numerical tool, and compared results to outputs from the MIRI simulator. We also applied principal component analysis (PCA) to identify and isolate systematic effects, with and without molecular mapping.
  RESULTS: We studied various systematic effects and their impacts on signal and noise. PCA helped highlight and reduce straylight, fringes, and aliasing. We further compared observed and modeled companion spectra.
  CONCLUSIONS: FastCurves was improved to account for systematics and validated with real data. In high-flux regimes, systematics impose contrast limits even with molecular mapping. Our approach could benefit other instruments and inform the planning of future facilities like ELT/ANDES and ELT/PCS.</description>

Abstract: The Sun is the most studied of all stars, and thus constitutes a benchmark for stellar models. However, our vision of the Sun is still incomplete, as illustrated by the current debate on its chemical composition. The problem reaches far beyond chemical abundances and is intimately linked to microscopic and macroscopic physical ingredients of solar models such as radiative opacity, for which experimental results have been recently measured that still await theoretical explanations. We present opacity profiles derived from helioseismic inferences and compare them with detailed theoretical computations of individual element contributions using three different opacity computation codes, in a complementary way to experimental results. We find that our seismic opacity is about 10% higher than theoretical values used in current solar models around 2 million degrees, but lower by 35% than some recent available theoretical values. Using the Sun as a laboratory of fundamental physics, we show that quantitative comparisons between various opacity tables are required to understand the origin of the discrepancies between reported helioseismic, theoretical and experimental opacity values.</description>

      <title>Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not appear to agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield. The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit the mass of a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future observational studies of the inner solar system can not only refine these constraints but also help to identify and to assess the mass of its dark-matter component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the era of NASA's Apollo missions, Keith S. Runcorn proposed an explanation of discrepancy between the Moon's negligible global magnetic field and magnetized samples of lunar regolith, based on identical vanishing of external magnetic field of a spherical shell, magnetized by an internal source which is no longer present. We revisit and generalize the Runcorn's result, showing that it is a consequence of a (weighted) orthogonality of gradients of harmonic functions on a spherical shell in arbitrary number of dimensions. Furthermore, we explore bounds on external magnetic field in the case when the idealized spherical shell is replaced with a more realistic geometric shape and when the thermoremanent magnetization susceptibility deviates from the spherical symmetry. Finally, we analyse a model of thermoremanent magnetization acquired by crustal inward cooling of a spherical astrophysical body and put some general bounds on the associated magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Characterizing planetary material accreted by cool helium atmosphere white dwarfs using an exponentially decaying disc model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) observations and model atmosphere analysis for two nearby, cool, helium-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that have been polluted by accretion: WD J1927-0355 and WD J2141-3300. Detected elements common to both white dwarfs are Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni, with additional detections of Na, Al, Si and Sr in WD J2141-3300. We present an approach for inferring the composition of the accreted material, by adopting a physically motivated model in which the mass accretion rate decays exponentially with time, which provides constraints on the time since the start of the accretion event. The accretion events were most likely to have began at least 1 Myr ago, however the characteristic disc lifetime could not be constrained due to degeneracies. Both white dwarfs were found to have accreted bulk planetary material with compositions similar to that of both bulk Earth and chondritic meteorites. The parent bodies causing pollution in both cases were inferred to be the mass of a small moon or dwarf planet.</description>
