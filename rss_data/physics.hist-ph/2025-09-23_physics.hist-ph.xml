      <title>Chaotic interaction between thermodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous study [1], we proposed a new physical law applicable to both particle and thermodynamical systems. Additionally, we introduced a physical definition of chaos and self-organization. In the present work, we extend this novel interaction scheme to various thermodynamical systems in order to test the universality of the proposed law. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of these systems also exhibit chaotic behavior under different conditions. We discussed the relationship between chaotic dynamics and the least action, and for the first time, we proposed the "Chaotic Action Principle" (CAP). Furthermore, we examined the validity of the physical and philosophical foundations of this new law and the associated definition of chaos. Finally, based on CAP, we proposed a new conceptual definition of complexity.</description>

      <title>Prigogine's temporalization of physics: two agnostic attitudes of physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I aim to clarify the unconscious ideologies and attitudes held by physicists through Prigogine's work. Prigogine was an outstanding chemist and physicist who made significant contributions to the development of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. At the same time, he extended his ideas beyond physics into the humanities, engaging in an interdisciplinary exploration of scientific and philosophical thought. Due to this unique careers, Prigogine's reception has been deeply divided. However, rather than focusing on the controversies surrounding his work, this study highlights his intellectual endeavors, using them as a lens to examine the underlying worldview of modern physics. Through this analysis, I will uncover two distinct agnostic attitudes-one held by dynamicists and the other by Prigogine himself. Finally, drawing on Bergson's philosophy, I will explore Prigogine's vision of a new relationship between humans and nature, as well as his temopralization of time in broader context to extend their philosophy alive.</description>
