      <title>High Probability Complexity Bounds of Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under weaker noise conditions, our method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds, while also exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation. We validate our theoretical findings and evaluate the practical performance of our method on CUTEst benchmark test set.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Quantum Computing for Accelerated Classical Algorithms in Power Systems Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advent of commercially available quantum annealing hardware (QAH) has expanded opportunities for research into quantum annealing-based algorithms. In the domain of power systems, this advancement has driven increased interest in applying such algorithms to mixed-integer problems (MIP) like Unit Commitment (UC). UC focuses on minimizing power generator operating costs while adhering to physical system constraints. Grid operators solve UC instances daily to meet power demand and ensure safe grid operations. This work presents a novel hybrid algorithm that leverages quantum and classical computing to solve UC more efficiently. We introduce a novel Benders-cut generation technique for UC, thereby enhancing cut quality, reducing expensive quantum-classical hardware interactions, and lowering qubit requirements. Additionally, we incorporate a $k$-local neighborhood search technique as a recovery step to ensure a higher quality solution than current QAH alone can achieve. The proposed algorithm, QC4UC, is evaluated on a modified instance of the IEEE RTS-96 test system. Results from both a simulated annealer and real QAH are compared, demonstrating the effectiveness of this algorithm in reducing qubit requirements and producing near-optimal solutions on noisy QAH.</description>

      <title>Tractable downfall of basis pursuit in structured sparse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding the sparsest solution to a linear underdetermined system of equations, as it often appears in data analysis, optimal control and system identification problems, is considered. This non-convex problem is commonly solved by convexification via $\ell_1$-norm minimization, also known as basis pursuit. In this work, a class of structured matrices, representing the system of equations, is introduced for which the basis pursuit approach tractably fails to recover the sparsest solution. In particular, we are able to identify matrix columns that correspond to unrecoverable non-zero entries of the sparsest solution, as well as to conclude the uniqueness of the sparsest solution in polynomial time. These deterministic guarantees contrast popular probabilistic ones, and as such, provide valuable insights into the a priori design of sparse optimization problems. As our matrix structure appears naturally in optimal control problems, we exemplify our findings by showing that it is possible to verify a priori that basis pursuit may fail in finding fuel optimal regulators for a class of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safe Control of Nonlinear Systems under Stochastic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring safety in stochastic control systems with high-relative-degree constraints while maintaining feasibility and mitigating conservatism in risk evaluation. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide an effective framework for enforcing safety constraints in nonlinear systems. However, existing methods struggle with feasibility issues and multi-step uncertainties. To address these challenges, we introduce Risk-aware Adaptive CBFs (RACBFs), which integrate Discrete-time Auxiliary-Variable adaptive CBFs (DAVCBFs) with coherent risk measures. DAVCBFs introduce auxiliary variables to improve the feasibility of the optimal control problem, while RACBFs incorporate risk-aware formulations to balance safety and risk evaluation performance. By extending discrete-time high-order CBF constraints over multiple steps, RACBFs effectively handle multi-step uncertainties that propagate through the system dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a stochastic unicycle system, showing that RACBFs maintain safety and feasibility while reducing unnecessary conservatism compared to standard robust formulations of discrete-time CBF methods.</description>

      <title>Average consensus with resilience and privacy guarantees without losing accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving private and resilient average consensus among a group of discrete-time networked agents without compromising accuracy. State-of-the-art solutions to attain privacy and resilient consensus entail an explicit trade-off between the two with an implicit compromise on accuracy. In contrast, in the present work, we propose a methodology that avoids trade-offs between privacy, resilience, and accuracy. We design a methodology that, under certain conditions, enables non-faulty agents, i.e., agents complying with the established protocol, to reach average consensus in the presence of faulty agents, while keeping the non-faulty agents' initial states private. For privacy, agents strategically add noise to obscure their original state, while later withdrawing a function of it to ensure accuracy. Besides, and unlikely many consensus methods, our approach does not require each agent to compute the left-eigenvector of the dynamics matrix associated with the eigenvalue one. Moreover, the proposed framework has a polynomial time complexity relative to the number of agents and the maximum quantity of faulty agents. Finally, we illustrate our method with examples covering diverse faulty agents scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Least Singular Value Function in Variational Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric regularity is among the central concepts of nonlinear and variational analysis, constrained optimization, and their numerous applications. However, met- ric regularity can be elusive for some important ill-posed classes of problems includ- ing polynomial equations, parametric variational systems, smooth reformulations of complementarity systems with degenerate solutions, etc. The study of stability issues for such problems can often not rely on the machinery of first-order variational anal- ysis, and so higher-order regularity concepts have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we investigate some notions of mixed-order regularity by using advanced tools of first-order and second-order variational analysis and generalized differenti- ation of both primal and dual types. Efficient characterizations of such mixed-order regularity concepts are established by employing a fresh notion of the least singular value function. The obtained conditions are applied to deriving constructive criteria for mixed-order regularity in coupled constraint and variational systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing train dispatching for the Union Pacific Railroad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Union Pacific (UP) is one of the largest transportation companies in the world, with over 50.000 kms of rail network covering 23 states in the United States. In 2017 Union Pacific embarked on a project that within 5 years would lead it to become the only rail operator in the world equipped with a technology capable of fully automating the real-time management and optimization of train traffic. In 2021 the main milestone of such project has been reached with the first deployment of the automated dispatching system we present here. To attack such large and complex problem, we decomposed it into distinct but interrelated functional components, and developed optimization models and methods to handle such components. The models communicate with each other through variables and constraints, and by a careful timing of invocations. In this paper we give an overview of the overall approach.</description>

      <title>Variational conditional normalizing flows for computing second-order mean field control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean field control (MFC) problems have vast applications in artificial intelligence, engineering, and economics, while solving MFC problems accurately and efficiently in high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. This work introduces variational conditional normalizing flow (VCNF), a neural network-based variational algorithm for solving general MFC problems based on flow maps. Formulating MFC problems as optimal control of Fokker-Planck (FP) equations with suitable constraints and cost functionals, we use VCNF to model the Lagrangian formulation of the MFC problems. In particular, VCNF builds upon conditional normalizing flows and neural spline flows, allowing efficient calculations of the inverse push-forward maps and score functions in MFC problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VCNF through extensive numerical examples, including optimal transport, regularized Wasserstein proximal operators, and flow matching problems for FP equations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic exit-time control on the half-line over a finite horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a finite-time stochastic drift control problem with the assumption that the control is bounded and the system is controlled until the state process leaves the half-line. Assuming general conditions, it is proved that the resulting parabolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation has a classical solution. In fact, we consider an even more general family of semilinear equations, which might be helpful in solving other control or game problems. Not only is the existence result proved, but also a recursive procedure for finding a solution resulting from a fixed-point argument is provided. An application to the dividend optimization problem is presented.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time gradient flows for unbounded convex functions on Gromov hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In proper, geodesic Gromov hyperbolic spaces, we investigate discrete-time gradient flows via the proximal point algorithm for unbounded Lipschitz convex functions. Assuming that the target convex function has negative asymptotic slope along some ray (thus unbounded below), we first prove the uniqueness of such a negative direction in the boundary at infinity. Then, using a contraction estimate for the proximal (resolvent) operator established in our previous work, we show that the discrete-time gradient flow from an arbitrary initial point diverges to that unique direction of negative asymptotic slope. This is inspired by and generalizes results of Karlsson-Margulis and Hirai-Sakabe on nonpositively curved spaces and a result of Karlsson concerning semi-contractions on Gromov hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based process design and operation involves here-and-now and wait-and-see decisions. Here-and-now decisions include design variables like the size of heat exchangers or the height of distillation columns, whereas wait-and-see decisions are directed towards operational variables like reflux and split ratios. In this contribution, we describe how to deal with these different types of decisions in a multicriteria framework, offering an adjustability for the wait-and-see variables while at the same time respecting optimality guarantees on process KPIs.</description>

      <title>On Solving the Maximum Flow Problem with Conflict Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maximum Flow Problem with Conflict Constraints is a generalization that adds conflict constraints to a classical optimization problem on networks used to model several real-world applications. In the last few years several approaches, both heuristic and exact, have been proposed to attack the problem. In this paper we consider a mixed integer linear program and solve it with an open-source solver. Computational results on the benchmark instances commonly used in the literature of the problem are reported. All the 160 instances benchmark instances normally used in the literature are solved to optimality for the first time, with 28 instances closed for the first time. Moreover, in the process, 6 improvements to the best-known heuristic solutions are also found.</description>

      <title>Chance-constrained battery management strategies for the electric bus scheduling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global transition to battery electric buses (EBs) presents an opportunity to reduce air and noise pollution in urban areas. However, the adoption of EBs introduces challenges related to limited driving range, extended charging times, and battery degradation. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel chance-constrained model for the electric vehicle scheduling problem (E-VSP) that accounts for stochastic energy consumption and battery degradation. The model ensures compliance with recommended state-of-charge (SoC) ranges while optimizing operational costs. A tailored branch-and-price heuristic with stochastic pricing problems is developed. Computational experiments on realistic instances demonstrate that the stochastic approach can provide win-win solutions compared to deterministic baselines in terms of operational costs and battery wear. By limiting the probability of operating EBs outside the recommended SoC range, the proposed framework supports fleet management practices that align with battery leasing company and manufacturer guidelines for battery health and longevity.</description>

      <title>Observability of linear systems on the Heisenberg Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In control theory, understanding the observability property of a system is crucial for effectively managing and controlling dynamical systems. This property empowers us to deduce the internal state of a system from its outputs over time, even when direct measurements are impossible. By harnessing observability, we can accurately estimate the complete state of a system and reconstruct its dynamics using just limited information. In this work, we will find conditions for observability of linear systems in the three dimensional Heisenberg group $\mathcal{H}$. Considering the homomorphisms between the group and its simply connected subgroups, whose kernel is denoted by $K$, we will find sufficient conditions for observability on the system using a quotient space $\mathcal{H}/K$ as the output.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In control theory, researchers need to understand a system's local and global behaviors in relation to its initial conditions. When discussing observability, the main focus is on the ability to analyze the system using an output space defined by an output map.
  In this study, our objective was to establish conditions for characterizing the observability properties of linear control systems on Lie groups. We will focus on five classes of solvable, non-nilpotent three-dimensional Lie groups, examining local and global perspectives. This analysis explores the kernels of homomorphisms between the state space and its simply connected subgroups, where the output is projected onto the quotient space.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Frequency-Based Approach for Maximal Square Detection in Binary Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel frequency-based algorithm that solves the maximal square problem with improved practical speed performance, while maintaining optimal asymptotic complexity. The proposed approach tracks the columnar continuity of the ones through an adaptive frequency vector and dynamic thresholding mechanism, which eliminates the need for nested minimum operations commonly found in standard dynamic programming solutions. Theoretical analysis confirms the time complexity of O(mn) and the space complexity of O(n), with formal loop-invariant proofs ensuring correctness. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates speed improvements of 1.3-5x over standard methods for various matrix densities and sizes. Applications in urban planning, environmental modeling, and medical image analysis are discussed.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning convex regularizers to guide the reconstruction of images from limited data. By imposing that the reconstruction be amplitude-equivariant, we narrow down the class of admissible functionals to those that can be expressed as a power of a seminorm. We then show that such functionals can be approximated to arbitrary precision with the help of polyhedral norms. In particular, we identify two dual parameterizations of such systems: (i) a synthesis form with an $\ell_1$-penalty that involves some learnable dictionary; and (ii) an analysis form with an $\ell_\infty$-penalty that involves a trainable regularization operator. After having provided geometric insights and proved that the two forms are universal, we propose an implementation that relies on a specific architecture (tight frame with a weighted $\ell_1$ penalty) that is easy to train. We illustrate its use for denoising and the reconstruction of biomedical images. We find that the proposed framework outperforms the sparsity-based methods of compressed sensing, while it offers essentially the same convergence and robustness guarantees.</description>

      <title>Optimal Modified Feedback Strategies in LQ Games under Control Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work explores the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs within the context of a two-player linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player affect the state and cost function of the other player. To address these deviations, we propose an adjusted control policy that not only mitigates adverse effects optimally but can also exploit the deviations to enhance performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are presented, demonstrating through a representative example that the proposed policy modification achieves up to $61\%$ improvement compared to the unadjusted feedback policy and up to $0.59\%$ compared to the feedback Nash strategy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parameter Adaptation for Safety-Critical Control via Safe Barrier Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety is of paramount importance in control systems to avoid costly risks and catastrophic damages. The control barrier function (CBF) method, a promising solution for safety-critical control, poses a new challenge of enhancing control performance due to its direct modification of original control design and the introduction of uncalibrated parameters. In this work, we shed light on the crucial role of configurable parameters in the CBF method for performance enhancement with a systematical categorization. Based on that, we propose a novel framework combining the CBF method with Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize the safe control performance. Considering feasibility/safety-critical constraints, we develop a safe version of BO using the barrier-based interior method to efficiently search for promising feasible configurable parameters. Furthermore, we provide theoretical criteria of our framework regarding safety and optimality. An essential advantage of our framework lies in that it can work in model-agnostic environments, leaving sufficient flexibility in designing objective and constraint functions. Finally, simulation experiments on swing-up control and high-fidelity adaptive cruise control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Noisier2Inverse: Self-Supervised Learning for Image Reconstruction with Correlated Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Noisier2Inverse, a correction-free self-supervised deep learning approach for general inverse prob- lems. The proposed method learns a reconstruction function without the need for ground truth samples and is ap- plicable in cases where measurement noise is statistically correlated. This includes computed tomography, where detector imperfections or photon scattering create correlated noise patterns, as well as microscopy and seismic imaging, where physical interactions during measurement introduce dependencies in the noise structure. Similar to Noisier2Noise, a key step in our approach is the generation of noisier data from which the reconstruction net- work learns. However, unlike Noisier2Noise, the proposed loss function operates in measurement space and is trained to recover an extrapolated image instead of the original noisy one. This eliminates the need for an extrap- olation step during inference, which would otherwise suffer from ill-posedness. We numerically demonstrate that our method clearly outperforms previous self-supervised approaches that account for correlated noise.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of a Lightweight and Accurate Neural Network for Aerodynamic Performance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring high accuracy and efficiency of predictive models is paramount in the aerospace industry, particularly in the context of multidisciplinary design and optimization processes. These processes often require numerous evaluations of complex objective functions, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. To build efficient and accurate predictive models, we propose a new approach that leverages Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize the hyper-parameters of a lightweight and accurate Neural Network (NN) for aerodynamic performance prediction. To clearly describe the interplay between design variables, hierarchical and categorical kernels are used in the BO formulation. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through two comprehensive case studies, where the optimized NN significantly outperforms baseline models and other publicly available NNs in terms of accuracy and parameter efficiency. For the drag coefficient prediction task, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of our optimized model drops from 0.1433\% to 0.0163\%, which is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over the baseline model. Additionally, our model achieves a MAPE of 0.82\% on a benchmark aircraft self-noise prediction problem, significantly outperforming existing models (where their MAPE values are around 2 to 3\%) while requiring less computational resources. The results highlight the potential of our framework to enhance the scalability and performance of NNs in large-scale MDO problems, offering a promising solution for the aerospace industry.</description>

      <title>A multiobjective approach to robust predictive control barrier functions for discrete-time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optimisation-based approach to ensure robust asymptotic stability stability of a desired set in the state space of nonlinear dynamical systems, while optimising a general control objective. The approach relies on the decrease of a robust predictive control barrier function (PCBF), which is defined as the optimal value function of a slack minimisation problem with respect to the target set. We show continuity of the proposed robust PCBF, allowing the introduction of a decrease constraint in the control objective minimisation. The PCBF decrease is given with respect to a warmstart value based on a feasible solution at the prior time step. Thereby, the control objective can be optimised while ensuring robust asymptotic stability of the target set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation on a linear space rendezvous and nonlinear lane changing problem.</description>

      <title>Approximating $q \rightarrow p$ Norms of Non-Negative Matrices in Nearly-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first nearly-linear time algorithm for approximating $\ell_{q \rightarrow p}$-norms of non-negative matrices, for $q \geq p \geq 1$. Our algorithm returns a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation to the matrix norm in time $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{q \varepsilon} \cdot \text{nnz}(\boldsymbol{\mathit{A}})\right)$, where $\boldsymbol{\mathit{A}}$ is the input matrix, and improves upon the previous state of the art, which either proved convergence only in the limit [Boyd '74], or had very high polynomial running times [Bhaskara-Vijayraghavan, SODA '11]. Our algorithm is extremely simple, and is largely inspired from the coordinate-scaling approach used for positive linear program solvers.
  We note that our algorithm can readily be used in the [Englert-R\"{a}cke, FOCS '09] to improve the running time of constructing $O(\log n)$-competitive $\ell_p$-oblivious routings. We thus complement this result with a simple cutting-plane based scheme for computing $\textit{optimal}$ oblivious routings in graphs with respect to any monotone norm. Combined with state of the art cutting-plane solvers, this scheme runs in time $\widetilde{O}(n^6 m^3)$, which is significantly faster than the one based on Englert-R\"{a}cke, and generalizes the $\ell_\infty$ routing algorithm of [Azar-Cohen-Fiat-Kaplan-R\"acke, STOC '03].</description>

      <title>An Overview of Low-Rank Structures in the Training and Adaptation of Large Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of deep learning has revolutionized data processing and prediction in signal processing and machine learning, yet the substantial computational demands of training and deploying modern large-scale deep models present significant challenges, including high computational costs and energy consumption. Recent research has uncovered a widespread phenomenon in deep networks: the emergence of low-rank structures in weight matrices and learned representations during training. These implicit low-dimensional patterns provide valuable insights for improving the efficiency of training and fine-tuning large-scale models. Practical techniques inspired by this phenomenon, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and training, enable significant reductions in computational cost while preserving model performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in exploiting low-rank structures for deep learning and shed light on their mathematical foundations. Mathematically, we present two complementary perspectives on understanding the low-rankness in deep networks: (i) the emergence of low-rank structures throughout the whole optimization dynamics of gradient and (ii) the implicit regularization effects that induce such low-rank structures at convergence. From a practical standpoint, studying the low-rank learning dynamics of gradient descent offers a mathematical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of LoRA in fine-tuning large-scale models and inspires parameter-efficient low-rank training strategies. Furthermore, the implicit low-rank regularization effect helps explain the success of various masked training approaches in deep neural networks, ranging from dropout to masked self-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>A Spectrum-based Filter Design for Periodic Control of Systems with Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fully analytical controller design is proposed to tackle a periodic control problem for stable linear systems with an input delay. Applying the internal model control scheme, the controller design reduces to designing a filter, which is done through the placement of poles and zeros. The zeros are placed to compensate for the harmonics and to achieve the desired degree of properness for the filter. For placing the poles, a quasi-optimal procedure is proposed utilizing the standard LQR method. Given the high-dimensionality of the filter due to targeting a large number of harmonics, the design, as well as controller implementation, is performed over a state-space representation. A thorough experimental case study is included to demonstrate both the practical feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control design. The experimental validation is performed on a physical system, the goal of which is to reject periodic vibrations acting on a mass-spring-damper setup where the sensor and the actuator are non-collocated.</description>

Abstract: To estimate the displacements of physical state variables, the physics principles that govern the state variables must be considered. Technically, for a certain class of state variables, each state variable is associated to a tensor field. Ways displacement maps act on different state variables will then differ according to their associated different tensor field definitions. Displacement procedures can then explicitly ensure the conservation of certain physical quantities (total mass, total vorticity, total kinetic energy, etc.), and a differential-geometry-based optimisation formulated. Morphing with the correct physics, it is reasonable to apply the estimated displacement map to unobserved state variables, as long as the displacement maps are strongly correlated. This leads to a new nudging strategy using all-available observations to infer displacements of both observed and unobserved state variables. Using the proposed nudging method before applying ensemble data assimilation, numerical results show improved preservation of the intrinsic structure of underlying physical processes.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving $N$ agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of $N$ coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to $N$-player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behaviour as the number of agents, $N$, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the $N$-player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the empirical average state converges to the mean field and that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>On the sequential convergence of Lloyd's algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lloyd's algorithm is an iterative method that solves the quantization problem, i.e. the approximation of a target probability measure by a discrete one, and is particularly used in digital applications.This algorithm can be interpreted as a gradient method on a certain quantization functional which is given by optimal transport. We study the sequential convergence (to a single accumulation point) for two variants of Lloyd's method: (i) optimal quantization with an arbitrary discrete measure and (ii) uniform quantization with a uniform discrete measure. For both cases, we prove sequential convergence of the iterates under an analiticity assumption on the density of the target measure. This includes for example analytic densities truncated to a compact semi-algebraic set. The argument leverages the log analytic nature of globally subanalytic integrals, the interpretation of Lloyd's method as a gradient method and the convergence analysis of gradient algorithms under Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz assumptions. As a by-product, we also obtain definability results for more general semi-discrete optimal transport losses such as transport distances with general costs, the max-sliced Wasserstein distance and the entropy regularized optimal transport loss.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Grid-Safe Forwarding of Distributed Flexibility in Sequential DSO-TSO Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates sequential flexibility markets consisting of a first market layer for distribution system operators (DSOs) to procure local flexibility to resolve their own needs (e.g., congestion management) followed by a second layer, in which the transmission system operator (TSO) procures remaining flexibility forwarded from the distribution system layer as well as flexibility from its own system for providing system services. As the TSO does not necessarily have full knowledge of the distribution grid constraints, this bid forwarding can cause an infeasibility problem for distribution systems, i.e., cleared distribution-level bids in the TSO layer might not satisfy local network constraints. To address this challenge, we introduce and examine three methods aiming to enable the grid-safe use of distribution-located resources in markets for system services, namely: a corrective three-layer market scheme, a bid prequalification/filtering method, and a bid aggregation method. Technically, we provide conditions under which these methods can produce a grid-safe use of distributed flexibility. We also characterize the efficiency of the market outcome under these methods. Finally, we carry out a representative case study to evaluate the performances of the three methods, focusing on economic efficiency, grid-safety, and computational load.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address a class of nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problems where the objective function is the sum of two smooth functions (one of which is proximable) and two nonsmooth functions (one proper, closed and proximable, and the other continuous and weakly concave). We introduce a new splitting algorithm that extends the Davis-Yin splitting (DYS) algorithm to handle such four-term nonconvex nonsmooth problems. We prove that with appropriately chosen stepsizes, our algorithm exhibits global subsequential convergence to stationary points with a stationarity measure converging at a global rate of $1/T$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. When specialized to the setting of the DYS algorithm, our results allow for larger stepsizes compared to existing bounds in the literature. Experimental results demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We study singular optimal control problems of port-Hamiltonian (descriptor) systems. We employ general control-affine cost functionals that include as a special case the energy supplied to the system. We first derive optimality conditions for the case of ordinary differential equations with and without control bounds by applying the general theory to the specially structured port-Hamiltonian case, and show that this leads to nice optimality conditions, in particular in the linear case. We then extend these results to classes of port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Markov Chains for Constant Step-size Stochastic Gradient Descent with Separable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for minimizing objective functions that arise in machine learning. For constant step-sized SGD, the iterates form a Markov chain on a general state space. Focusing on a class of separable (non-convex) objective functions, we establish a "Doeblin-type decomposition," in that the state space decomposes into a uniformly transient set and a disjoint union of absorbing sets. Each of the absorbing sets contains a unique invariant measure, with the set of all invariant measures being the convex hull. Moreover the set of invariant measures are shown to be global attractors to the Markov chain with a geometric convergence rate. The theory is highlighted with examples that show: (1) the failure of the diffusion approximation to characterize the long-time dynamics of SGD; (2) the global minimum of an objective function may lie outside the support of the invariant measures (i.e., even if initialized at the global minimum, SGD iterates will leave); and (3) bifurcations may enable the SGD iterates to transition between two local minima. Key ingredients in the theory involve viewing the SGD dynamics as a monotone iterated function system and establishing a "splitting condition" of Dubins and Freedman 1966 and Bhattacharya and Lee 1988.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensing Precision for Celestial Navigation Systems in Cislunar Space using LPV Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces two innovative convex optimization formulations to simultaneously optimize the H2/Hinf observer gain and sensing precision, and guarantee a specified estimation error bound for nonlinear systems in LPV form. Applied to the design of an onboard celestial navigation system for cislunar operations, these formulations demonstrate the ability to maintain accurate spacecraft positioning with minimal measurements and theoretical performance guarantees by design.</description>

      <title>ADMM for 0/1 D-Opt and MESP relaxations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 0/1 D-optimality problem and the Maximum-Entropy Sampling problem are two well-known NP-hard discrete maximization problems in experimental design. Algorithms for exact optimization (of moderate-sized instances) are based on branch-and-bound. The best upper-bounding methods are based on convex relaxation. We present ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithms for solving these relaxations and experimentally demonstrate their practical value.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-like Stability Inequality with an Asymmetric Matrix and Application to Suboptimal LQ Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyapunov inequality is an indispensable tool for stability analysis in the linear control theory. This work proposes a new variant of this inequality where-in the constituent matrix is allowed to be asymmetric. After developing the stability conditions based on the proposed inequality for a class of linear systems, we utilize these conditions to derive new results for the suboptimal linear quadratic control problem where we characterize the cost of the stabilizing controllers. We also demonstrate, by a numerical example, that the proposed results can be easily molded for the structured suboptimal consensus protocol design for multi-agent system where we also see that the asymmetry condition of the design matrix turns up inherently.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Covariance Steering for Discrete-Time Markov Jump Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel convex optimization framework to solve the optimal covariance steering problem for discrete-time Markov Jump Linear Systems (MJLS) with chance constraints. We derive the analytical expressions for the mean and covariance trajectories of time-varying discrete-time MJLS and show that they cannot be separated even without chance constraints, unlike the single-mode dynamics case. To solve the covariance steering problem, we propose a two-step convex optimization framework, which optimizes the mean and covariance subproblems sequentially. Further, we use Gaussian approximations to incorporate chance constraints and propose an iterative optimization framework to solve the chance-constrained covariance steering problem. Both problems are originally nonconvex, and we derive convex relaxations which are proved to be lossless at optimality using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the proposed method by achieving target covariances while respecting chance constraints under Gaussian noise and Markovian jump dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the optimal control of viscous Cahn-Hilliard systems with hyperbolic relaxation of the chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a viscous Cahn--Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions in which a hyperbolic relaxation term involving the second time derivative of the chemical potential has been added to the first equation of the system. For the initial-boundary value problem of this system, results concerning well-posedness, continuous dependence and regularity are known. We show Fr\'echet differentiability of the associated control-to-state operator, study the associated adjoint state system, and derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Concerning the nonlinearities driving the system, we can include the case of logarithmic potentials. In addition, we perform an asymptotic analysis of the optimal control problem as the relaxation coefficient approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Distributed Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization with Compressed Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dual challenges of prohibitive communication overhead and the impracticality of gradient computation due to data privacy or black-box constraints in distributed systems motivate this work on communication-constrained gradient-free optimization. We propose a stochastic distributed zeroth-order algorithm (Com-DSZO) requiring only two function evaluations per iteration, integrated with general compression operators. Rigorous analysis establishes its sublinear convergence rate for both smooth and nonsmooth objectives, while explicitly elucidating the compression-convergence trade-off. Furthermore, we develop a variance-reduced variant (VR-Com-DSZO) under stochastic mini-batch feedback. The empirical algorithm performance are illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Vertex Enumeration of Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a state-of-the-art algorithm for the vertex enumeration problem of arrangements, which is based on the proposed new pivot rule, called the Zero rule. The Zero rule possesses several desirable properties: i) It gets rid of the objective function; ii) Its terminal satisfies uniqueness; iii) We establish the if-and-only if condition between the Zero rule and its valid reverse, which is not enjoyed by earlier rules; iv) Applying the Zero rule recursively definitely terminates in $d$ steps, where $d$ is the dimension of input variables. Because of so, given an arbitrary arrangement with $v$ vertices of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the algorithm's complexity is at most $\mathcal{O}(n^2d^2v)$ and can be as low as $\mathcal{O}(nd^4v)$ if it is a simple arrangement, while Moss' algorithm takes $\mathcal{O}(nd^2v^2)$, and Avis and Fukuda's algorithm goes into a loop or skips vertices because the if-and-only-if condition between the rule they chose and its valid reverse is not fulfilled. Systematic and comprehensive experiments confirm that the Zero rule not only does not fail but also is the most efficient.</description>

      <title>Fast Switching in Mixed-Integer Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive stability results for finite control set and mixed-integer model predictive control and propose a unified theoretical framework. The presentation rests upon the inherent robustness properties of common model predictive control with stabilizing terminal conditions and techniques for solving mixed-integer optimal control problems by continuous optimization. Partial outer convexification and binary relaxation transform mixed-integer problems into common optimal control problems. We derive nominal asymptotic stability for the resulting relaxed system formulation and implement sum-up rounding to restore efficiently integer feasibility. If fast control switching is technically possible and inexpensive, we can approximate the relaxed system behavior in the state space arbitrarily close. We integrate input perturbed model predictive control with practical asymptotic stability. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings and illustrate practical relevance of fast and systematic control switching.</description>
