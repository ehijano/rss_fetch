      <title>Jordan homomorphisms of triangular algebras over noncommutative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: D. Benkovi\v{c} described Jordan homomorphisms of algebras of triangular matrices over a commutative unital ring without additive $2$-torsion. We extend this result to the case of noncommutative rings and remove the assumption of additive torsion.
  Let $R$ be an associative unital algebra over a commutative unital ring $\Phi$. Consider the algebra $T_n(R)$ of triangular $n \times n$ matrices over $R$, and its subalgebra $T_n^0(R)$ consisting of matrices whose main diagonal entries lie in $\Phi$. We prove that for any Jordan homomorphism of $T_n(R)$, its restriction to $T_n^0(R)$ is standard.</description>

      <title>Frobenius forms on weakly primitive axial algebras of Jordan type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper we studied ``weakly primitive axial algebras'' with respect to more general fusion rules, for which at least one axis satisfies the fusion rules. In this continuation, a concise description is provided of the $2$-generated algebras we obtained in that paper and we show that in certain cases, the algebras have a Frobenius form, a key tool in their study.</description>

      <title>Unit Uniquely Clean Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the class of {\it unit uniquely clean} rings ({\it UnitUC} for short), that is a common generalization of uniquely clean rings and strongly nil clean rings. Abelian {\it UnitUC} rings are uniquely clean and {\it UnitUC} rings with nil Jacobson radical are strongly nil clean. These rings also generalize the UUC and CUC rings, defined by Calugareanu-Zhou in Mediterranean J. Math. (2023), which are rings whose clean elements are uniquely clean. These rings are also represent a natural generalization of the Boolian rings in that a ring is {\it UnitUC} if, and only if, it is exchange and Boolean modulo the Jacobson radical. The behavior of {\it UnitUC} rings under group ring and matrix ring extensions is investigated. Several examples are provided to explain and delimit the results.</description>

      <title>On the Enumeration of Symmetric Tridiagonal Matrices with prescribed Determinant over Commutative Finite Chain Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determinants of structured matrices play a fundamental role in both pure and applied mathematics, with wide-ranging applications in linear algebra, combinatorics, coding theory, and numerical analysis. In this work, the enumeration of symmetric tridiagonal matrices with prescribed determinant over finite fields and over commutative finite chain rings is developed. Using the recurrent formula for determinants, a recursive form of the numbers of singular and nonsingular symmetric tridiagonal matrices is derived, after which a uniform counting framework for any fixed determinant value is obtained. Over finite fields, quadratic-character techniques are employed. In odd dimensions, the enumeration is shown to be independent of the chosen nonzero determinant. Whereas, in even dimensions, it depends only on the quadratic residue/nonresidue class in the fields. For commutative finite chain rings, explicit formulas for nonsingular case are produced by lifting along the ideal chain and analyzing reduction to the residue field, yielding closed expressions in terms of the nilpotency index and the size of the residue fields. A layered enumeration has been developed for the study of symmetric tridiagonal matrices over commutative finite chain rings by stratifying determinants into ideal and punctured layers. Entry-wise reduction to quotient rings expresses each layer through zero-determinant counts on quotients, yielding formulas for prescribed determinants, including quadratic/non-quadratic residue factors, and a decomposition for the singular ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses a way for uniquely setting up the valuations for the minimal generators of the maximal ideal of a one dimensional complete reduced and irreducible local algebra over an algebraically closed field, when treated as a subring of its integral closure. Our observations are a generalization of the more well-studied case of a numerical semigroup ring. These results provide completion to some missing arguments in certain proofs present in the existing literature, including some results concerning a long-standing conjecture of R. Berger.</description>

      <title>Entrywise preservers of sign regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entrywise functions preserving positivity and related notions have a rich history, beginning with the seminal works of Schur, P\'olya-Szeg\H{o}, Schoenberg, and Rudin. Following their classical results, it is well-known that entrywise functions preserving positive semidefiniteness for matrices of all dimensions must be real analytic with non-negative Taylor coefficients. These works were taken forward in the last decade by Belton, Guillot, Khare, Putinar, and Rajaratnam. Recently, Belton-Guillot-Khare-Putinar [J. d'Analyse Math. 2023] classified all functions that entrywise preserve totally positive (TP) and totally non-negative (TN) matrices. In this paper, we study entrywise preservers of strictly sign regular and sign regular matrices - a class that includes TP/TN matrices as special cases and was first studied by Schoenberg in 1930 to characterize variation diminution. Our main results provide complete characterizations of entrywise transforms of rectangular matrices which preserve: (i)~sign regularity and strict sign regularity, as well as (ii)~sign regularity and strict sign regularity with a given sign pattern.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms and derivations on algebras endowed with formal infinite sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between automorphisms and derivations on certain algebras of generalised power series. In particular, we describe a Lie algebra of derivations on a field $k(\!(G)\!)$ of generalised power series, exploiting our knowledge of its group of valuation preserving automorphisms. The correspondence is given by the formal Taylor expansion of the exponential. In order to define the exponential map, we develop an appropriate notion of summability of infinite families in algebras. We show that there is a large class of algebras in which the exponential induces the above correspondence.</description>

      <title>On finite dimensional regular gradings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an associative algebra over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic 0. A decomposition $A=A_1\oplus\cdots \oplus A_r$ of $A$ into a direct sum of $r$ vector subspaces is called a \textsl{regular decomposition} if, for every $n$ and every $1\le i_j\le r$, there exist $a_{i_j}\in A_{i_j}$ such that $a_{i_1}\cdots a_{i_n}\ne 0$, and moreover, for every $1\le i,j\le r$ there exists a constant $\beta(i,j)\in K^*$ such that $a_ia_j=\beta(i,j)a_ja_i$ for every $a_i\in A_i$, $a_j\in A_j$. We work with decompositions determined by gradings on $A$ by a finite abelian group $G$. In this case, the function $\beta\colon G\times G\to K^*$ ought to be a bicharacter. A regular decomposition is {minimal} whenever for every $g$, $h\in G$, the equalities $\beta(x,g)=\beta(x,h)$ for every $x\in G$ imply $g=h$. In this paper we describe the finite dimensional algebras $A$ (with unit) admitting a $G$-grading such that the corresponding regular decomposition is minimal. Moreover we compute the graded codimension sequence of these algebras assuming complete support. It turns out that the graded PI exponent of every finite dimensional $G$-graded algebra with regular grading such that its regular decomposition is minimal and it has complete support, coincides with its ordinary (ungraded) PI exponent. Finally we have shown that the regular decomposition of a finite dimensional regular $G$-grading $A$ is minimal if and only if $\exp(A)=|G|$.</description>

      <title>Relation morphisms of directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associating graph algebras to directed graphs leads to both covariant and contravariant functors from suitable categories of graphs to the category k-Alg of algebras and algebra homomorphisms. As both functors are often used at the same time, finding a new category of graphs that allows a "common denominator" functor unifying the covariant and contravariant constructions is a fundamental problem. Herein, we solve this problem by first introducing the relation category of graphs RG, and then determining the concept of admissible graph relations that yields a subcategory of RG admitting a contravariant functor to k-Alg simultaneously generalizing the aforementioned covariant and contravariant functors. Although we focus on Leavitt path algebras and graph C*-algebras, on the way we unravel functors to k-Alg given by path algebras, Cohn path algebras and Toeplitz graph C*-algebras from suitable subcategories of RG. Better still, we illustrate relation morphisms of graphs by naturally occurring examples, including Cuntz algebras, quantum spheres and quantum balls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of quasi-triangular and factorizable Poisson bialgebras. A factorizable Poisson bialgebra induces a factorization of the underlying Poisson algebra. We prove that the Drinfeld classical double of a Poisson bialgebra naturally admits a factorizable Poisson bialgebra structure. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter Poisson algebras and show that a quadratic Rota-Baxter Poisson algebra of zero weight induces a triangular Poisson bialgebra. Moreover, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between factorizable Poisson bialgebras and quadratic Rota-Baxter Poisson algebras of nonzero weights. Finally, we establish the quasi-triangular and factorizable theories for differential antisymmetric infinitesimal (ASI) bialgebras, and construct quasi-triangular and factorizable Poisson bialgebras from quasi-triangular and factorizable (commutative and cocommutative) differential ASI bialgebras respectively.</description>

      <title>On induced completely prime primitive ideals in enveloping algebras of classical Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A distinguished family of completely prime primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra of a reductive Lie algebra ${\mathfrak g}$ over ${\mathbb C}$ are those ideals constructed from one-dimensional representations of finite $W$-algebras. We refer to these ideals as Losev--Premet ideals. For ${\mathfrak g}$ simple of classical type, we prove that for a Losev-Premet ideal $I$ in $U({\mathfrak g})$, there exists a Losev-Premet ideal $I_0$ for a certain Levi subalgebra ${\mathfrak g}_0$ of ${\mathfrak g}$ such that associated variety of $I_0$ is the closure of a rigid nilpotent orbit in ${\mathfrak g}_0$ and $I$ is obtained from $I_0$ by parabolic induction; in turn, this gives a classification of rigid Losev-Premet ideals in $U({\mathfrak g})$. This is deduced from the corresponding statement about one-dimensional representations of finite $W$-algebras.</description>

Abstract: In [Incer Romeo, I. X., \textit{The Algebra of Contracts}. Ph.D. Thesis, UC Berkeley (2022)] an algebraic perspective on assume-guarantee contracts is proposed. This proposal relies on a construction involving Boolean algebras. However, the structures thus proposed lack a clearly prescribed set of basic operations, necessary if we want to see them as a class of algebras (in the sense of Universal Algebra). In this article, by prescribing a suitable set of basic operations on contracts, we manage to describe these algebras as (a generating set of members of) well-known varieties.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial categories satisfy a stronger form of Yoneda Lemma, namely, the isomorphism type of an object can be recovered by counting the number of homomorphisms from all other objects into it. In this work, we show that this property holds for sufficiently small categories by studying the algebra of homomorphism-counting functions. We present applications of the results to the isomorphism problem in group, graph and ring theory.</description>
