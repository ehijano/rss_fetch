      <title>Skill Learning Using Process Mining for Large Language Model Plan Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for generating plans for complex tasks, but their effectiveness is limited by sequential execution, lack of control flow models, and difficulties in skill retrieval. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the efficiency and interpretability of plan generation as LLMs become more central to automation and decision-making. We introduce a novel approach to skill learning in LLMs by integrating process mining techniques, leveraging process discovery for skill acquisition, process models for skill storage, and conformance checking for skill retrieval. Our methods enhance text-based plan generation by enabling flexible skill discovery, parallel execution, and improved interpretability. Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our approach, with our skill retrieval method surpassing state-of-the-art accuracy baselines under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>LFOSum: Summarizing Long-form Opinions with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online reviews play a pivotal role in influencing consumer decisions across various domains, from purchasing products to selecting hotels or restaurants. However, the sheer volume of reviews -- often containing repetitive or irrelevant content -- leads to information overload, making it challenging for users to extract meaningful insights. Traditional opinion summarization models face challenges in handling long inputs and large volumes of reviews, while newer Large Language Model (LLM) approaches often fail to generate accurate and faithful summaries. To address those challenges, this paper introduces (1) a new dataset of long-form user reviews, each entity comprising over a thousand reviews, (2) two training-free LLM-based summarization approaches that scale to long inputs, and (3) automatic evaluation metrics. Our dataset of user reviews is paired with in-depth and unbiased critical summaries by domain experts, serving as a reference for evaluation. Additionally, our novel reference-free evaluation metrics provide a more granular, context-sensitive assessment of summary faithfulness. We benchmark several open-source and closed-source LLMs using our methods. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs still face challenges in balancing sentiment and format adherence in long-form summaries, though open-source models can narrow the gap when relevant information is retrieved in a focused manner.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Realization of n-Bit Toffoli Gates for IBM Quantum Computers Using the Bloch Sphere Approach and IBM Native Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cost-effective n-bit Toffoli gate is proposed to be realized (or transpiled) based on the layouts (linear, T-like, and I-like) and the number of n physical qubits for IBM quantum computers. This proposed gate is termed the "layout-aware n-bit Toffoli gate". The layout-aware n-bit Toffoli gate is designed using the visual approach of the Bloch sphere, from the visual representations of the rotational quantum operations for IBM native gates. In this paper, we also proposed a new formula for the quantum cost, which calculates the total number of native gates, the crossing connections, and the depth of the final transpiled quantum circuit. This formula is termed the "transpilation quantum cost". After transpilation, our proposed layout-aware n-bit Toffoli gate always has a much lower transpilation quantum cost than that of the conventional n-bit Toffoli gate, where 3 &lt;= n &lt;= 7 qubits, for different IBM quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Neural Correlates of Augmented Reality Safety Warnings: EEG Analysis of Situational Awareness and Cognitive Performance in Roadway Work Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the research and implementation efforts involving various safety strategies, protocols, and technologies, work zone crashes and fatalities continue to occur at an alarming rate each year. This study investigates the neurophysiological responses to Augmented Reality safety warnings in roadway work zones under varying workload conditions. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, we objectively assessed situational awareness, attention, and cognitive load in simulated low-intensity (LA) and moderate-intensity (MA) work activities. The research analyzed key EEG indicators including beta, gamma, alpha, and theta waves, as well as various combined wave ratios. Results revealed that AR warnings effectively triggered neurological responses associated with increased situational awareness and attention across both workload conditions. However, significant differences were observed in the timing and intensity of these responses. In the LA condition, peak responses occurred earlier (within 125 ms post-warning) and were more pronounced, suggesting a more robust cognitive response when physical demands were lower. Conversely, the MA condition showed delayed peak responses (125-250 ms post-warning) and more gradual changes, indicating a potential impact of increased physical activity on cognitive processing speed. These findings underscore the importance of considering physical workload when designing AR-based safety systems for roadway work zones. The research contributes to the understanding of how AR can enhance worker safety and provides insights for developing more effective, context-aware safety interventions in high-risk work environments.</description>

      <title>D-Wave's Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver: Description and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most prominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been introduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address specific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently utilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the Hybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to accelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and operational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this portfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this solver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across three combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Knapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this relatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to solve these three optimization problems.</description>
