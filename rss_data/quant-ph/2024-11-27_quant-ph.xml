      <title>Sequential Attack Impairs Security in Device-independent Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) leverages nonlocal correlations to securely establish cryptographic keys between two honest parties while making minimal assumptions about the underlying systems. The security of DI-QKD relies on the validation of quantum theory, with Bell violations ensuring the inherent unpredictability of the observed statistics, independent of the trustworthiness of the devices. While traditional QKD attacks are generally categorised as individual, collective, or coherent attacks, we introduce a novel attack strategy-the sequential attack. In this approach, Eve intercepts the transmitted quantum particle, performs an unsharp measurement to preserve the Bell violation between the honest parties, and disguises her interference as noise. Such a strategy enables Eve to extract substantial information about the key, even without performing collective measurements. Furthermore, when combined with collective attack, this strategy significantly reduces the secure key rate and, under certain conditions, can render it to zero. We show that within specific ranges of Bell violations and quantum bit error rates, the cumulative effect of sequential and collective attacks poses a stronger threat to DI-QKD security than collective attacks alone. These findings underscore the vulnerability of DI-QKD to real-world imperfections, emphasising that Bell nonlocality alone is insufficient to guarantee security in practical implementations.</description>

      <title>A fluorescent-protein spin qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically-addressable spin qubits form the foundation of a new generation of emerging nanoscale sensors. The engineering of these sensors has mainly focused on solid-state systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. However, NVs are restricted in their ability to interface with biomolecules due to their bulky diamond host. Meanwhile, fluorescent proteins have become the gold standard in bioimaging, as they are genetically encodable and easily integrated with biomolecules. While fluorescent proteins have been suggested to possess a metastable triplet state, they have not been investigated as qubit sensors. Here, we realize an optically-addressable spin qubit in the Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) enabled by a novel spin-readout technique. A near-infrared laser pulse allows for triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 44% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the EYFP spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a spin-lattice relaxation time of $(141 \pm 5)$ {\mu}s, a $(16 \pm 2)$ {\mu}s coherence time under Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) decoupling, and a predicted oscillating (AC) magnetic field sensitivity with an upper bound of $183 \, \mathrm{fT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically-detected magnetic resonance at room temperature in aqueous solution with contrast up to 3%, and measure a static (DC) field sensitivity with an upper bound of $93 \, \mathrm{pT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Our results establish fluorescent proteins as a powerful new qubit sensor platform and pave the way for applications in the life sciences that are out of reach for solid-state technologies.</description>

      <title>Mobility edges in pseudo-unitary quasiperiodic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Floquet quasicrystal that simulates the motion of Bloch electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field in discrete time steps. We admit the hopping to be non-reciprocal which, via a generalized Aubry duality, leads us to push the phase that parametrizes the synthetic dimension off of the real axis. This breaks unitarity, but we show that the model is still ``pseudo-unitary''. We unveil a novel mobility edge between a metallic and an insulating phase that sharply divides the parameter space. Moreover, for the first time, we observe a second transition that appears to be unique to the discrete-time setting. We quantify both phase transitions and relate them to properties of the spectrum. If the hopping is reciprocal either in the lattice direction or the synthetic dimension, the model is $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, and the spectrum is confined to the unit circle up to a critical point. At this critical point, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is spontaneously broken and the spectrum leaves the unit circle. This transition is topological and measured by a spectral winding number.</description>

      <title>Boundaries for quantum advantage with single photons and loop-based time-bin interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop-based boson samplers interfere photons in the time degree of freedom using a sequence of delay lines. Since they require few hardware components while also allowing for long-range entanglement, they are strong candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage beyond the reach of classical emulation. We propose a method to exploit this loop-based structure to more efficiently simulate such systems. Our algorithm exploits a causal-cone argument to decompose the circuit into smaller effective components that can each be simulated sequentially by calling a state vector simulator as a subroutine. To quantify the complexity of our approach, we develop a new lattice path formalism that allows us to efficiently characterize the state space that must be tracked during the simulation. In addition, we develop a heuristic method that allows us to predict the expected average and worst-case memory requirements of running these simulations. We use these methods to compare the simulation complexity of different families of loop-based interferometers, allowing us to quantify the potential for quantum advantage of single-photon Boson Sampling in loop-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Dynamic violation of Bell's inequalities in the angular momentum representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parametrization of density matrices of $d$ dimensions in terms of the raising $J_+$ and lowering $J_-$ angular momentum operators is established together with an implicit connection with the generalized Bloch-GellMann parameters. A general expression for the density matrix of the composite system of angular momenta $j_1$ and $j_2$ is obtained. In this matrix representation violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequalities are established for the $X$-states of a qubit-qubit, pure and mixed, composite system, as well as for a qubit-qutrit density matrix. In both cases maximal violation of the Bell inequalities can be reached, i.e., the Cirel'son limit. A correlation between the entanglement measure and a strong violation of the Bell factor is also given. For the qubit-qutrit composite system a time-dependent convex combination of the density matrix of the eigenstates of a two-particle Hamiltonian system is used to determine periodic maximal violations of the Bell's inequality.</description>

      <title>Post-Markovian master equation \`{a} la microscopic collisional model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a completely positive post-Markovian master equation (PMME) from a microscopic Markovian collisional model framework, incorporating bath memory effects via a probabilistic single-shot measurement approach. This phenomenological master equation is both analytically solvable and numerically tractable. Depending on the choice of the memory kernel function, the PMME can be reduced to the exact Nakajima-Zwanzig equation or the Markovian master equation, enabling a broad spectrum of dynamical behaviors. We also investigate thermalization using the derived equation, revealing that the post-Markovian dynamics accelerates the thermalization process, exceeding rates observed within the Markovian framework. Our approach solidifies the assertion that "collisional models can simulate any open quantum dynamics", underscoring the versatility of the models in realizing open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-preserved cost functions for variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms are considered ideal for noisy quantum computers, as they significantly reduce quantum circuit depth compared to fully quantum methods like quantum phase estimation. This reduction requires a classical variational optimization task. Ideally, circuits are shallow enough to avoid quantum noise, and the cost function is convex but not flat, enabling efficient optimization. However, quantum circuits based on unitary coupled cluster ans\"atze scale quartically with the number of qubits. Hardware-Efficient Ans\"atze (HEA) offer shallower circuits but suffer from optimization issues, including symmetry breaking. We propose encoding symmetry preservation directly into the cost function, enabling more efficient use of HEA. Our variational, iterative algorithm controls circuit depth and optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>Robustness of WDM technique for the co-propagation of quantum with classical signals in an optical fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum communication systems operate based on weak light pulses which by design are assumed to operate in isolation from regular data traffic. With the widespread availability and commercialization of these systems comes a need for seamless integration already at the physical layer. In particular for optical fiber links where wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is the dominant data transmission technique this results in the propagation of very weak quantum signals against a strong data signal background. With this work, we present a novel theoretical approach that studies the evolution of co-propagating quantum and classical signals that are launched using WDM. The important factors that contribute to crosstalk, such as the launch power of the classical signal and the separation between the two signals in terms of wavelength, are comprehensively analyzed. Interestingly, calculations show that only the first two nearest channels from the classical channel experience noticeable crosstalk whereas other distant channels have negligible crosstalk effect. This reflects the WDM technique is in principle robust in the integration of weak quantum links into classical data traffic.</description>

      <title>A Review of Design Concerns in Superconducting Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short review we describe the process of designing a superconducting circuit device for quantum information applications. We discuss the factors that must be considered to implement a desired effective Hamiltonian on a device. We describe the translation between a device's physical layout, the circuit graph, and the effective Hamiltonian. We go over the process of electromagnetic simulation of a device layout to predict its behavior. We also discuss concerns such as connectivity, crosstalk suppression, and radiation shielding, and how they affect both on-chip design and enclosure structures. This paper provides an overview of the challenges in superconducting quantum circuit design and acts as a starter document for researchers working on any of these challenges.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Quantum Anomaly Detection on Noisy Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether in fundamental physics, cybersecurity or finance, the detection of anomalies with machine learning techniques is a highly relevant and active field of research, as it potentially accelerates the discovery of novel physics or criminal activities. We provide a systematic analysis of the generalization properties of the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) algorithm, using projected quantum kernels for a realistic dataset of the latter application. These results were both theoretically simulated and experimentally validated on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, by leveraging partial state tomography to obtain precise approximations of the quantum states that are used to estimate the quantum kernels. Moreover, we analyzed both platforms respective hardware-efficient feature maps over a wide range of anomaly ratios and showed that for our financial dataset in all anomaly regimes, the quantum-enhanced OCSVMs lead to better generalization properties compared to the purely classical approach. As such our work bridges the gap between theory and practice in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and paves the path towards useful quantum applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naturally occurring radiation backgrounds cause correlated decoherence events in superconducting qubits. These backgrounds include both gamma rays produced by terrestrial radioisotopes and cosmic rays. We use the particle-transport code Geant4 and the PARMA summary of the cosmic-ray spectrum to model both sources of natural radiation and to study their effects in the typical substrates used in superconducting electronics. We focus especially on three rates that summarize radiation's effect on substrates. We give analytic expressions for these rates, and how they depend upon parameters including laboratory elevation, substrate material, ceiling thickness, and wafer area and thickness. The modeled rates and the distribution of event energies are consistent with our earlier measurement of radiation backgrounds using a silicon thermal kinetic-inductance detector.</description>

      <title>Tower of Structured Excited States from Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing highly entangled quantum states is a key challenge in quantum metrology and quantum information science. Measurements, especially those of global observables, offer a simple and efficient way to generate entanglement between subsystems when they are measured as a whole. We introduce a log-depth protocol leveraging quantum phase estimation to measure a global observable, such as total magnetization and momentum. We demonstrate its capability to prepare towers of structured excited states that are useful in quantum metrology; examples include quantum many-body scars in various models, including the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, the constrained domain-wall model, and the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$ XX chains. The same method is also applicable to preparing the Dicke states of high weight. In addition, we propose a protocol for momentum measurement that avoids disturbing the system, facilitating the preparation of states beyond the above construction, such as the Arovas $A$ state of the AKLT Hamiltonian. Our results expand the utility of measurement-based approaches to accessing highly entangled states in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states. We find that, in stark contrast to displacement and two-photon squeezing, higher-order squeezing leads to oscillatory dynamics. The state is squeezed in the initial stages of the dynamics but the squeezing reverses at later stages, and the state reverts almost completely back to the initial state. We analyze various quantities to verify that the oscillatory dynamics is physical and not a mathematical artefact. We also show that the maximum squeezing diminishes with increasing squeezing order, rendering the squeezing mechanism increasingly ineffective. Our results provide important rules that can help guide the development of more effective higher-order squeezing techniques.</description>

Starting with symplectic matrices for CNOT, CZ, Phase, and Hadamard operators, which together generate the Clifford group, we design explicit transformations that result in targeted logical gates for arbitrary HGP codes. As a concrete example, we give logical circuits for the $[[18,2,3]]$ toric code.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate, and error-resilient noise spectroscopy via basis optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Orbital-State Control of a Neutral Nitrogen-Vacancy Center at Millikelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neutral nitrogen-vacancy center (NV$^0$) is promising for realizing strong coupling with a single microwave photon due to its large electric field sensitivity, although it is susceptible to environmental phonon noise at 5 K. Decreasing the temperature to 15 mK results in a tenfold increase in orbital relaxation time compared to that at 5 K. Dynamical decoupling pulses significantly increase the orbital coherence time to around 1.8 $\mu$s, representing a 30-fold improvement compared to that without decoupling pulses. Based on these results, a single NV$^0$ can reach the strong coupling regime when coupled with a high-impedance microwave resonator, thus opening up the possibility of microwave quantum electrodynamics using a single optically-active defect center in diamond.</description>

      <title>Going beyond quantum Markovianity and back to reality: An exact master equation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise characterization of dynamics in open quantum systems often presents significant challenges, leading to the introduction of various approximations to simplify a model. One commonly used strategy involves Markovian approximations, assuming a memoryless environment. In this study, such approximations are not used and an analytical dynamical depiction of an open quantum system is provided. The system under consideration is an oscillator that is surrounded by a bath of oscillators. The resulting dynamics are characterized by a second-order complex coefficient linear differential equation, which may be either homogeneous or inhomogeneous. Moreover, distinct dynamical regions emerge, depending on certain parameter values. Notably, the steady-state average excitation number (AEN) of the system shows rapid escalation with increasing non-Markovianity, reflecting the intricacies of real-world dynamics. In cases where there is detuning between the system frequency and the environmental central frequency within a non-Markovian regime, the AEN maintains its initial value for an extended period. Furthermore, the application of pulse control can effectively protect the quantum system from decoherence effects without using approximations. The pulse control can not only prolong the relaxation time of the oscillator, but can also be used to speed up the relaxation process, depending on the specifications of the pulse. By employing a kick pulse, the Mpemba effect can be observed in the non-Markovian regime in a surprisingly super-cooling-like effect.</description>

      <title>Photonic Spin Hall Effect in a Four-Level Coherent Control Scheme within Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the manipulation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and $\Lambda$ (CTL), or $\Lambda$, or $N$ level model by manipulating the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable PSHE over the wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance, the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits PSHE similar to the CTL system, showing enhanced PSHE due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density show no influence on PSHE. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence PSHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for PSHE manipulation. The results are equally valid and applicable to direct $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity QED. The demonstrated tunability via probe field detuning, control fields, and atomic density paves the way for advanced optical control and enhanced precision in cavity QED devices.</description>

      <title>Polarization and Orbital Angular Momentum Encoded Quantum Toffoli Gate Enabled by Diffractive Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled quantum gates play a crucial role in enabling quantum universal operations by facilitating interactions between qubits. Direct implementation of three-qubit gates simplifies the design of quantum circuits, thereby being conducive to performing complex quantum algorithms. Here, we propose and present an experimental demonstration of a quantum Toffoli gate fully exploiting the polarization and orbital angular momentum of a single photon. The Toffoli gate is implemented using the polarized diffractive neural networks scheme, achieving a mean truth table visibility of $97.27\pm0.20\%$. We characterize the gate's performance through quantum state tomography on 216 different input states and quantum process tomography, which yields a process fidelity of $94.05\pm 0.02\%$. Our method offers a novel approach for realizing the Toffoli gate without requiring exponential optical elements while maintaining extensibility to the implementation of other three-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Experimental entanglement swapping through single-photon $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In photonic quantum information processing, quantum operations using nonlinear photon-photon interactions are vital for implementing two-qubit gates and enabling faithful entanglement swapping. However, due to the weak interaction between single photons, the all-photonic realization of such quantum operations has remained out of reach so far. Herein, we demonstrate a first entanglement swapping using sum-frequency generation (SFG) between single photons in a $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinear optical waveguide. We show that a highly efficient, stable SFG-based Bell-state analyzer and an ultralow-dark-count superconducting single-photon detector satisfy the high signal-to-noise ratio requirement for the swapping protocol.Furthermore, the system clock is enhanced by utilizing ultrafast telecom entangled photon pair sources that operate in the GHz range. Our results confirm a lower bound 0.770(76) for the swapped state's fidelity, surpassing the classical limit of 0.5 successfully. Our findings highlight the strong potential of broadband all-single-photonic nonlinear interactions for further sophistication in long-distance quantum communication and photonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Memories with Light-Matter Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and demonstrate a new approach for enhancing quantum memory protocols, leveraging constructive light-matter interference within the memory. We implement this method with a Raman quantum memory in warm Cesium vapor, and demonstrate a more than three-fold improvement in total efficiency from $(10.4\pm0.5)\%$ to $(34.3\pm8.4)\%$ with the same peak control pulse intensity, whilst retaining the GHz-bandwidth of the memory and observing no increase in the measured noise. Numerical simulations further explore the performance of this method across different regimes, including low atomic density systems and scenarios with limited laser intensity. For systems limited by atomic density, such as cold atomic systems, we predict our method can boost the efficiency from $65\%$ to beyond $96\%$, while the same method applied to warm atomic vapors could potentially exceed $95\%$ efficiency with an order-of-magnitude reduction in intensity requirements. We also explore the effect on modal capacity and find that our protocol preserves the single-mode nature of the memory at significantly higher efficiencies. This protocol is broadly applicable to various quantum memory architectures, paving the way toward scalable, efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Light Statistics from Large Ensembles of Independent Two-level Emitters: Classical or Non-classical?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the photon statistics of an ensemble of coherently driven non-interacting two-level atoms in the weak driving regime. As it turns out, the system displays unique emission characteristics that are strongly in contrast to the emission of classical oscillating dipoles. By deriving the second-order autocorrelation function, we show that extraordinary two-photon correlations are obtained, ranging from strong antibunching to superbunching. These features are enhanced by disorder in the emitter positions, and the control parameter is the number of excitations in the system. We observe the appearance of bunching and antibunching when the light is scattered by the atoms predominantly coherently, i.e., mimicking classical Rayleigh scattering, whereas thermal photon statistics is obtained when the light is scattered via spontaneous decay, a well-known quantum effect. The underlying mechanism is the interplay between coherent scattering, which exhibits spatial fluctuations due to interference, and dissipation in the form of isotropic spontaneous decay.</description>

      <title>Superactivation of memory effects in a classical Markov environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a phenomenon known as Superactivation of Backflow of Information (SBFI); namely, the fact that the tensor product of a non-Markovian dynamics with itself exhibits Backflow of Information (BFI) from environment to system even if the single dynamics does not. Such an effect is witnessed by the non-monotonic behaviour of the Helstrom norm and emerges in the open dynamics of two independent, but statistically coupled, parties. We physically interpret SBFI by means of the discrete-time non-Markovian dynamics of two open qubits collisionally coupled to an environment described by a classical Markov chain. In such a scenario SBFI can be ascribed to the decrease of the qubit-qubit-environment correlations in favour of those of the two qubits, only. We further prove that the same mechanism at the roots of SBFI also holds in a suitable continuous-time limit. We also show that SBFI does not require entanglement to be witnessed, but only the quantumness of the Helstrom ensemble.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Non-Hermitian Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet their underlying physical mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the ${PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Our work uncovers the physical mechanism of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and introduces a new perspective with broad implications for the control and application of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Applying the quantum approximate optimization algorithm to general constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop theoretical techniques for analysing the performance of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) when applied to random boolean constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), and use these techniques to compare the complexity of a variety of CSPs, such as $k$-SAT, 1-in-$k$ SAT, and NAE-SAT. Our techniques allow us to compute the success probability of QAOA with one layer and given parameters, when applied to randomly generated instances of CSPs with $k$ binary variables per constraint, in time polynomial in $n$ and $k$. We apply this algorithm to all boolean CSPs with $k=3$ and a large number of CSPs with $k=4$, $k=5$, and compare the resulting complexity with the complexity of solving the corresponding CSP using the standard solver MapleSAT, determined experimentally. We find that random $k$-SAT seems to be the most promising of these CSPs for demonstrating a quantum-classical separation using QAOA.</description>

      <title>Robustness of tripartite entangled states in passive PT-symmetric qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17457v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems have attracted significant interest in recent years due to the presence of unique spectral singularities known as exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. The drastic changes in these systems around their EPs have led to unique entanglement dynamics, which remained elusive until quite recently. In this work, we theoretically investigate the robustness of tripartite entanglement induced by EPs of the passive PT-symmetric non-Hermitian superconducting qubits, both in stand-alone configurations and hybrid setups with Hermitian qubits. In particular, we consider the qubits with both all-to-all and nearest-neighbour couplings under uniform and non-uniform coupling strengths. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian qubits with all-to-all coupling generate GHZ states, while those with nearest-neighbour interactions produce W states. These entangled states are resilient to non-uniform couplings and off-resonant driving fields. Moreover, the hybrid configurations combining Hermitian and non-Hermitian qubits suggest the importance of EPs for generating and maintaining genuine tripartite entanglement in our system. Additionally, driving the PT-symmetric qubits with a strong Rabi frequency can help sustain tripartite entanglement over time by countering losses, while strong inter-qubit coupling can benefit these entangled states in the low dissipation regime. These findings suggest that exploiting non-Hermitian systems and their associated EPs can create robust entangled states which are useful for both fundamental studies and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multisilce method is an important algorithm for electron diffraction and image simulations in transmission electron microscopy. We have proposed a quantum algorithm of the multislice method based on quantum circuit model previously. In this work we have developed an improved quantum algorithm. We reconstruct the phase-shifting quantum circuit without using the multi-controlled quantum gates, thereby significantly improve the computation efficiency. The new quantum circuit also allows further gate count reduction at the cost of a controllable error. We have simulated the quantum circuit on a classical supercomputer and analyzed the result to prove the feasibility and correctness of the improved quantum algorithm. We also provide proper parameter settings through testing, allowing the minimization of the necessary number of quantum gates while limiting the relative error within 1%. This work demonstrates the potential of applying quantum computing to electron diffraction simulations and achieving quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>High-Performance and Scalable Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Lattice Surgery on a 2.5D Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high error rate of a qubit, detecting and correcting errors on it is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Among several FTQC techniques, lattice surgery (LS) using surface code (SC) is currently promising. To demonstrate practical quantum advantage as early as possible, it is indispensable to propose a high-performance and low-overhead FTQC architecture specialized for a given FTQC scheme based on detailed analysis.
  In this study, we first categorize the factors, or hazards, that degrade LS-based FTQC performance and propose a performance evaluation methodology to decompose the impact of each hazard, inspired by the CPI stack. We propose the Bypass architecture based on the bottleneck analysis using the proposed evaluation methodology. The proposed Bypass architecture is a 2.5-dimensional architecture consisting of dense and sparse qubit layers and successfully eliminates the bottleneck to achieve high-performance and scalable LS-based FTQC. We evaluate the proposed architecture with a circuit-level stabilizer simulator and a cycle-accurate LS simulator with practical quantum phase estimation problems. The results show that the Bypass architecture improves the fidelity of FTQC and achieves both a 1.73x speedup and a 17% reduction in classical/quantum hardware resources over a conventional 2D architecture.</description>

      <title>End-to-end QKD network with non-localized trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are infamously known for their high demand on hardware, their extremely low key generation rates and their lack of security resulting from a need for trusted nodes which is implied by the absence of quantum repeaters. While they theoretically offer unlimited security, they are therefore practically limited in several regards. In this work we focus on the lack of options to guarantee an end-to-end security service with the currently available technology and infrastructure and propose a novel protocol. We find that one of the stumbling stones on the path towards an end-to-end security service guaranteed by quantum key distribution may be removed by using this protocol. Our proposal combines several parallel instances of twinfield QKD followed by classical postprocessing and communication to allow Alice and Bob to share a secret key. This hybrid approach improves the key rate and range w.r.t. to previous QKD approaches at a contained cost in security. We show that a coalition of intermediary nodes between Alice and Bob is needed to break the new scheme, sharply outperforming the trusted node approach in terms of security. Furthermore, the protocols do not require complex quantum measurements on Alice and Bob's sides, thus being truly end-to-end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warehouse optimization stands as a critical component for enhancing operational efficiency within the industrial sector. By strategically streamlining warehouse operations, organizations can achieve significant reductions in logistical costs such as the necessary footprint or traveled path, and markedly improve overall workflow efficiency including retrieval times or storage time. Despite the availability of numerous algorithms designed to identify optimal solutions for such optimization challenges, certain scenarios demand computational resources that exceed the capacities of conventional computing systems. In this context, we adapt a formulation of a warehouse optimization problem specifically tailored as a binary optimization problem and implement it in a trapped-ion quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Updating the constraint on the quantum collapse models via kilogram masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics, which governs all microscopic phenomena, encounters challenges when applied to macroscopic objects that exhibit classical behavior. To address this micro-macro disparity, collapse models such as the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) and Diosi-Penrose (DP) models have been proposed. These models phenomenologically modify quantum theory to reconcile its predictions with the observed classical behavior of macroscopic systems. Based on previous works\,([Phys.\,Rev\,D,\,95(8):084054\,(2017)] and [Phys.\,Rev.\,D,\,94:124036,\,(2016)]), an improved bound on the collapse model parameters is given using the updated acceleration noise data released from LISA Pathfinder\,([Phys.\,Rev.\,D, 110(4):042004,\,(2024)]). The CSL collapse rate is bounded to be at most $\lambda_{\rm CSL} \leq 8.3\times 10^{-11}$\,$s^{-1}$ at the mili-Hertz band when $r_{\rm CSL}=10^{-7}\,{\rm m}$, and the DP model's regularization cut-off scale is constraint to be $\sigma_{\rm DP}\sim 285.5$\,fm. Furthermore, we discuss the potential advantages of using deep-underground laboratories to test these quantum collapse models. Our results show the quiet seismic condition of the current deep-underground laboratory has the potential to further constrain the CSL collapse model to $\lambda_{\rm CSL}\leq3\times 10^{-11}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ when $r_{\rm CSL}=10^{-7}\,{\rm m}$.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Quantum Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative quantum machine learning has gained significant attention for its ability to produce quantum states with desired distributions. Among various quantum generative models, quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models (QuDDPMs) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 100602 (2024)] provide a promising approach with stepwise learning that resolves the training issues. However, the requirement of high-fidelity scrambling unitaries in QuDDPM poses a challenge in near-term implementation. We propose the \textit{mixed-state quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model} (MSQuDDPM) to eliminate the need for scrambling unitaries. Our approach focuses on adapting the quantum noise channels to the model architecture, which integrates depolarizing noise channels in the forward diffusion process and parameterized quantum circuits with projective measurements in the backward denoising steps. We also introduce several techniques to improve MSQuDDPM, including a cosine-exponent schedule of noise interpolation, the use of single-qubit random ancilla, and superfidelity-based cost functions to enhance the convergence. We evaluate MSQuDDPM on quantum ensemble generation tasks, demonstrating its successful performance.</description>

      <title>Towards parameterizing the entanglement body of a qubit pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method allowing to increase a computational efficiency of evaluation of non-local characteristics of a pair of qubits is described. The method is based on the construction of coordinates on a generic section of 2-qubit's entanglement space $\mathcal{E}_{2\times2}$ represented as the direct product of an ordered 3-dimensional simplex and the double coset $\mathrm{SU(2)}\times\mathrm{SU(2)}{\backslash} {\mathrm{SU(4)}}/ \mathrm{T^3}\,.$ Within this framework, the subset $\mathcal{SE}_{2\times2} \subset\mathcal{E}_{2\times2}$ corresponding to the rank-4 separable 2-qubit states is described as a semialgebraic variety given by a system of 3rd and 4th order polynomial inequalities in eigenvalues of the density matrix, whereas the polynomials coefficients are trigonometric functions defined over a direct product of two regular octahedra.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wave Simulation with Sources and Loss Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithmic framework for simulating linear, anti-Hermitian (lossless) wave equations in heterogeneous, anisotropic, but time-independent media. This framework encompasses a broad class of wave equations, including the acoustic wave equation, Maxwells equations, and the elastic wave equation. Our formulation is compatible with standard numerical discretization schemes and allows for efficient implementation of source terms for diverse time- and space-dependent sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that subspace energies can be extracted and wave fields compared through an $l_2$-loss function, achieving optimal precision scaling with the number of samples taken. Additionally, we introduce techniques for incorporating boundary conditions and linear constraints that preserve the anti-Hermitian nature of the equations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian simulation algorithm, our framework achieves a quartic speed-up over classical solvers in 3D simulations, under conditions of sufficiently global measurements and compactly supported sources and initial conditions. We argue that this quartic speed-up is optimal for time domain solutions, as the Hamiltonian of the discretized wave equations has local couplings. In summary, our framework provides a versatile approach for simulating wave equations on quantum computers, offering substantial speed-ups over state-of-the-art classical methods.</description>

      <title>A new architecture for high speed core-selective switch for multicore fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of multicore optical fibers is now recognized as one of the most promising methods to implement the space-division multiplexing techniques required to overcome the impending capacity limit of conventional single-mode optical fibers. Nonetheless, new devices for networking operations compatible with these fibers will be required in order to implement the next-generation high-capacity optical networks. In this work, we develop a new architecture to build a high-speed core-selective switch, critical for efficiently distributing signals over the network. The device relies on multicore interference, and can change among outputs in less than 0.7 us, while achieving less than -18 dB of average inter-core crosstalk, making it compatible with a wide range of network switching tasks. The functionality of the device was demonstrated by routing a 1GBs optical signal and by successfully switching signals over a field-installed multicore fiber network. Our results demonstrate for the first time the operation of a multicore optical fiber switch functioning under real-world conditions, with switching speeds that are three orders of magnitude faster than current commercial devices. This new optical switch design is also fully compatible with standard multiplexing techniques and, thus, represents an important achievement towards the integration of high-capacity multicore telecommunication networks.</description>

      <title>Toward a Quantum Computing Formulation of the Electron Nuclear Dynamics Method via Fukutome Unitary Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first installment of the quantum computing (QC) formulation of the electron nuclear dynamics (END) method within the variational quantum simulator (VQS) scheme: END/QC/VQS. END is a time-dependent, variational, on-the-flight, and non-adiabatic method to simulate chemical reactions. END represents nuclei with frozen Gaussian wave packets and electrons with a single-determinantal state in the Thouless non-unitary representation. Within the hybrid quantum/classical VQS, END/QC/VQS evaluates the metric matrix M and gradient vector V of the symplectic END/QC equations on a quantum computer, and calculates basis function integrals and time evolution on a classical computer. To adapt END to QC, we substitute the Thouless non-unitary representation with Fukutome unitary representation. We formulate the first END/QC/VQS version for pure electronic dynamics in chemical models consisting of two-electron units. Therein, Fukutome unitary matrices factorize into products of triads of one-qubit rotational matrices, which leads to a QC encoding of one electron per qubit. We design QC circuits to evaluate M and V in one-electron diatomic molecules. In log2-log2 plots, errors and deviations of those evaluations decrease linearly with the number of shots and with slopes = -1/2. We illustrate an END/QC/VQS simulation with the pure electronic dynamics of H2+. We discuss the present results and future END/QC/QVS extensions.</description>

      <title>Puncturing Quantum Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17754v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical coding theory contains several techniques to obtain new codes from other codes, including puncturing and shortening. For quantum codes, a form of puncturing is known, but its description is based on the code space rather than its generators. In this work, we generalize the puncturing procedure to allow more freedom in the choice of which coded states are kept and which are removed. We describe this puncturing by focusing on the stabilizer matrix containing the generators of the code. In this way, we are able to explicitly describe the stabilizer matrix of the punctured code given the stabilizer matrix of the original stabilizer code. The additional freedom in the procedure also opens up new ways to construct new codes from old, and we present several ways to utilize this for the search of codes with good or even optimal parameters. In particular, we use the construction to obtain codes whose parameters exceed the best previously known. Lastly, we generalize the proof of the Griesmer bound from the classical setting to stabilizer codes since the proof relies heavily on the puncturing technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian lattice formulation of lattice gauge theories opens the possibility for quantum simulations of the non-perturbative dynamics of QCD. By parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in inverse powers of $N_c$. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting Hilbert space in terms of local electric energy states we give explicit constructions that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits to leading order in large $N_c$</description>

      <title>Cavity-Quantum Electrodynamics with Moir\'e Flatband Photonic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moir\'e patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moir\'e photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moir\'e cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moir\'e cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moir\'e flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.</description>

      <title>Anyons on M5-Probes of Seifert 3-Orbifolds via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that there is a rigorous derivation of (abelian) anyonic quantum states, hence of "topological order", on the 1+2-dimensional fixed locus of M5-probes wrapped over a trivially Seifert-fibered 3-orbifold singularity.
  Similar statements have previously been conjectured by appeal to the unknown dynamics of "coincident" M5-branes, but neglecting effects of flux-quantization that, as we highlight, entail anyonic solitons already in the rigorously tractable case of single M5-brane probes.
  This is possible after globally completing the "self-dual" tensor field on probe M5-branes by flux quantization in the non-abelian cohomology theory called equivariant twistorial Cohomotopy, which is admissible by recent results.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium relaxation exponentially delays the onset of quantum diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the exact many-body quantum dynamics of polarons in materials with strong carrier-phonon interactions presents a fundamental challenge, often necessitating one to adopt approximations that sacrifice the ability to predict the transition from nonequilibrium relaxation to thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we exploit a recent breakthrough that generalizes the concept of memory beyond its conventional temporal meaning to also encompass space. Specifically, we leverage our discovery that the dynamics of observables in systems with local couplings satisfy Green's functions with kernels that are local in time and space. This enables us to employ the dynamics of small lattices over short times to predict the dynamics of thermodynamically large lattices over arbitrarily long timescales while circumventing the deleterious impacts of finite-size effects. We thus interrogate the \textit{exact} nonequilibrium formation and migration of polarons in one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems, revealing that their motion approaches diffusive transport only asymptotically in time and system size. We also compare transport in 1D and 2D systems to investigate the effect of dimension in polaron migration physics, illustrating how energy variations can cause localization -- a phenomenon observable via current microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Topological domain-wall pump with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A domain-wall pump by an extended cluster model of $S=1/2$ spins is proposed with local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. Its snapshot ground state is gapped and doubly degenerated due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariance, which is broken by an infinitesimal boundary magnetic field. The ground state associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is still symmetry-protected with additional spatial inversion that is characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry phase. We investigate the topological domain-wall pump with/without boundaries. The topological pump associated with the inversion symmetry-breaking path induces a non-trivial Chern number of bulk and a singular behavior of edge states of the domain-wall. Generalization to the multi-spin interaction is also explicitly given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data processing inequality is central to information theory and motivates the study of monotonic divergences. However, it is not clear operationally we need to consider all such divergences. We establish a simple method for Pinsker inequalities as well as general bounds in terms of $\chi^{2}$-divergences for twice-differentiable $f$-divergences. These tools imply new relations for input-dependent contraction coefficients. We use these relations to show for many $f$-divergences the rate of contraction of a time homogeneous Markov chain is characterized by the input-dependent contraction coefficient of the $\chi^{2}$-divergence. This is efficient to compute and the fastest it could converge for a class of divergences. We show similar ideas hold for mixing times. Moreover, we extend these results to the Petz $f$-divergences in quantum information theory, albeit without any guarantee of efficient computation. These tools may have applications in other settings where iterative data processing is relevant.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic field and chemical potential induced anisotropy and frame dependent chaos of a $Q\bar{Q}$ pair in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. We further analyse the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>

      <title>Singly poled thin film lithium niobate waveguide as a tunable source of photon pairs across telecom band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), especially in non-linear waveguides, serves as an important process to generate quantum states of light with desired properties. In this work, we report on a design of a strongly dispersive, singly poled thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) waveguide geometry which acts as a convertible source of photon pairs across telecom band with tunable spectral properties. Through our simulations, we demonstrate that by using this optimized waveguide geometry, two completely different yet desirable type II phase-matched SPDC processes are enabled using a single poling period. One process generates spectrally correlated non-degenerate photon pairs with one photon at 1310 nm (telecom O band) and the other at 1550 nm (telecom C band). The second SPDC process results in spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs in telecom C band at 1533 nm and 1567 nm respectively.We attribute this versatility of TFLN waveguide to its strong dispersion properties and make a comparative study with the existing weakly dispersive waveguide platforms. We believe that such a versatile source of photon pairs will serve as an important ingredient in various quantum optical tasks which require photons at different telecom bands and desired spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Impact of Scalar NSI on Spatial and Temporal Correlations in Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments are gradually approaching an era of precision, where subleading effects can also be tested. One such subleading effect is Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), which can play a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. Various works have typically discussed vector NSI in the context of quantum correlations. Recently, there have been improvements in the bounds on scalar NSI as well. In light of these developments, we aim to examine the impact of scalar NSI on quantum correlation measures. To analyze this impact, we are considering the strongest measure of quantum correlation, i.e., non-locality. Our study will encompass both spatial and temporal non-locality measures.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulation of the Fokker-Planck Equation applied to Quantum Radiation Reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-future experiments with Petawatt class lasers are expected to produce a high flux of gamma-ray photons and electron-positron pairs through Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamical processes. Simulations of the expected regime of laser-matter interaction are computationally intensive due to the disparity of the spatial and temporal scales and because quantum and classical descriptions need to be accounted for simultaneously (classical for collective effects and quantum for nearly-instantaneous events of hard photon emission and pair creation). A typical configuration for experiments is a scattering of an electron and a laser beam which can be mapped to an equivalent problem with constant magnetic field. We study the stochastic cooling of an electron beam in a strong constant uniform magnetic field, both its particle distribution functions and their energy momenta. We start by obtaining approximate closed-form analytical solutions to the relevant observables. Then, we apply the quantum-hybrid Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing this process, and compare against theory and results from Particle-In-Cell simulations and classical Partial Differential Equation solvers, showing good agreement. This work will be useful as a first step towards quantum simulation of plasma physics scenarios where diffusion processes are important, in particular in strong electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in the Hayden-Preskill protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time. This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanished entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of semidefinite programs for generalised Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlations in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) scenarios, captured by \textit{assemblages} of unnormalised quantum states, have recently caught the attention of the community, both from a foundational and an information-theoretic perspective. The set of quantum-realisable assemblages, or abbreviated to quantum assemblages, are those that arise from multiple parties performing local measurements on a shared quantum system. In general, deciding whether or not a given assemblage is a quantum assemblage, i.e. membership of the set of quantum assemblages, is a hard problem, and not always solvable. In this paper we introduce a hierarchy of tests where each level either determines non-membership of the set of quantum assemblages or is inconclusive. The higher the level of the hierarchy the better one can determine non-membership, and this hierarchy converges to a particular set of assemblages. Furthermore, this set to which it converges contains the quantum assemblages. Each test in the hierarchy is formulated as a semidefinite program. This hierarchy allows one to upper bound the quantum violation of a steering inequality and the quantum advantage provided by quantum EPR assemblages in a communication or information-processing task.</description>

      <title>Indefinite causal key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol that is carried out in an indefinite causal order (ICO). In QKD, one considers a setup in which two parties, Alice and Bob, share a key with one another in such a way that they can detect whether an eavesdropper, Eve, has learnt anything about the key. To our knowledge, in all QKD protocols proposed until now, Eve is detected by publicly comparing a subset of Alice and Bob's key and checking for errors. We find that a consequence of our protocol is that it is possible to detect eavesdroppers without publicly comparing any information about the key. Indeed, we prove that it is not possible for eavesdroppers, performing any individual attack, to extract useful information about the shared key without inducing a nonzero probability of being detected. We also prove the security of this protocol against a class of individual eavesdropping attacks. The role ICO plays in causing unusual phenomena in quantum technologies is an important question. By considering it we find a two-way QKD protocol that exhibits a similar private detection feature, albeit with some interesting differences. After noting some implications of these differences and discussing some of the practicalities of our protocol, we conclude that this work is best considered as a first step in applying quantum cryptographic ideas in an ICO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the stabilizer fidelity is multiplicative for the tensor product of an arbitrary number of single-qubit states. We also show that the relative entropy of magic becomes additive if all the single-qubit states but one belong to a symmetry axis of the stabilizer octahedron. We extend the latter results to include all the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropy of magic. This allows us to identify a continuous set of magic monotones that are additive for single-qubit states. We also show that all the monotones mentioned above are additive for several standard two and three-qubit states subject to depolarizing noise. Finally, we obtain closed-form expressions for several states and tighter lower bounds for the overhead of probabilistic one-shot magic state distillation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the incompatibility of a set of measurements cannot be increased by subjecting them to a filter, namely, by combining them with a device that post-selects the incoming states on a fixed outcome of a stochastic transformation. This result holds for several measures of incompatibility, such as those based on robustness and convex weight. Expanding these ideas to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering experiments, we are able to solve the problem of the maximum steerability obtained with respect to the most general local filters in a way that allows for an explicit calculation of the filter operation. Moreover, our results generalize to nonphysical maps, i.e., positive but not completely positive linear maps.</description>

      <title>Wigner's Phase Space Current for Variable Beam Splitters -Seeing Beam Splitters in a New Light-</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06706v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beam splitters allow us to superpose two continuous single mode quantum systems. To study the behaviour of their strongly mode mixing dynamics we consider variable beam splitters and their dynamics using Wigner's phase space distribution, W, the evolution of which is governed by the continuity-equation $ \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} W = - {\nabla } \cdot {J}$. We derive the form of the corresponding Wigner current, J, of each outgoing mode after tracing out the other. The influence of the modes on each other is analyzed and visualized using their respective Wigner distributions and Wigner currents. This allows us to perform geometrical analyses of the mode interactions, casting new light on beam splitter behaviour. Several of the presented results should be immediately testable in experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient MPS representations and quantum circuits from the Fourier modes of classical image data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning tasks are an exciting application for quantum computers, as it has been proven that they can learn certain problems more efficiently than classical ones. Applying quantum machine learning algorithms to classical data can have many important applications, as qubits allow for dealing with exponentially more data than classical bits. However, preparing the corresponding quantum states usually requires an exponential number of gates and therefore may ruin any potential quantum speedups. Here, we show that classical data with a sufficiently quickly decaying Fourier spectrum after being mapped to a quantum state can be well-approximated by states with a small Schmidt rank (i.e., matrix-product states) and we derive explicit error bounds. These approximated states can, in turn, be prepared on a quantum computer with a linear number of nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates. We confirm our results numerically on a set of $1024\times1024$-pixel images taken from the `Imagenette' and DIV2K datasets. Additionally, we consider different variational circuit ans\"atze and demonstrate numerically that one-dimensional sequential circuits achieve the same compression quality as more powerful ans\"atze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A full-fledged quantum network relies on the formation of entangled links between remote location with the help of quantum repeaters. The famous Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller quantum repeater protocol is based on long distance single-photon interference, which not only requires high phase stability but also cannot generate maximally entangled state. Here, we propose a quantum repeater protocol using the idea of post-matching, which retains the same efficiency as the single-photon interference protocol, reduces the phase-stability requirement and can generate maximally entangled state in principle. We also outline an implementation of our scheme based on the Kerr nonlinear resonator. Numerical simulations show that our protocol has its superiority by comparing with existing protocols under a generic noise model and show the feasibility of building a large-scale quantum communication network with our scheme. We believe our work represents a crucial step towards the construction of a fully-connected quantum network.</description>

      <title>Towards early fault tolerance on a 2$\times$N array of qubits equipped with shuttling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well understood that a two-dimensional grid of locally-interacting qubits is a promising platform for achieving fault tolerant quantum computing. However in the near-future, it may prove less challenging to develop lower dimensional structures. In this paper, we show that such constrained architectures can also support fault tolerance; specifically we explore a 2$\times$N array of qubits where the interactions between non-neighbouring qubits are enabled by shuttling the logical information along the rows of the array. Despite the apparent constraints of this setup, we demonstrate that error correction is possible and identify the classes of codes that are naturally suited to this platform. Focusing on silicon spin qubits as a practical example of qubits believed to meet our requirements, we provide a protocol for achieving full universal quantum computation with the surface code, while also addressing the additional constraints that are specific to a silicon spin qubit device. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of this architecture using a realistic noise model, demonstrating that both surface code and more complex qLDPC codes efficiently suppress gate and shuttling noise to a level that allows for the execution of quantum algorithms within the classically intractable regime. This work thus brings us one step closer to the execution of quantum algorithms that outperform classical machines.</description>

Abstract: Striving for higher gate fidelity is crucial not only for enhancing existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices but also for unleashing the potential of fault-tolerant quantum computation through quantum error correction. A recently proposed theoretical scheme, the double-transmon coupler (DTC), aims to achieve both suppressed residual interaction and a fast high-fidelity two-qubit gate simultaneously, particularly for highly detuned qubits. Harnessing the state-of-the-art fabrication techniques and a model-free pulse-optimization process based on reinforcement learning, we translate the theoretical DTC scheme into reality, attaining fidelities of 99.90% for a CZ gate and 99.98% for single-qubit gates. The performance of the DTC scheme demonstrates its potential as a competitive building block for superconducting quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for solving noisy linear problems are reexamined, under the same assumptions taken from the existing literature. The findings of this work include on the one hand extended applicability of the quantum Fourier transform to the ring learning with errors problem which has been left open by Grilo et al., who first devised a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving noisy linear problems with quantum samples. On the other hand, this paper also shows there exist efficient classical algorithms for short integer solution and size-reduced learning with errors problems if the quantum samples used by the previous studies are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an iterative optimal control method of quantum systems, aimed at an implementation of a desired operation with optimal fidelity. The update step of the method is based on the linear response of the fidelity to the control operators, and its projection onto the mode functions of the corresponding operator. Our method extends methods such as gradient ascent pulse engineering and variational quantum algorithms, by determining the fidelity gradient in a hyperparameter-free manner, and using it for a multi-parameter update, capitalizing on the multi-mode overlap of the perturbation and the mode functions. This directly reduces the number of dynamical trajectories that need to be evaluated in order to update a set of parameters. We demonstrate this approach, and compare it to the standard GRAPE algorithm, for the example of a quantum gate on two qubits, demonstrating a clear improvement in convergence and optimal fidelity of the generated protocol.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Barriers in Dual-Unitary Clifford Circuits with Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study temporal entanglement in dual-unitary Clifford circuits with probabilistic measurements preserving spatial unitarity. We exactly characterize the temporal entanglement barrier in the measurement-free regime, exhibiting ballistic growth and decay and a volume-law peak. In the presence of measurements, we relate the temporal entanglement to the scrambling properties of the circuit. For "good scramblers" measurements do not qualitatively change the temporal entanglement profile but only result in a reduced entanglement velocity, whereas for "poor scramblers" the initial ballistic growth of temporal entanglement with bath size is modified to diffusive. This difference is understood through a mapping of the underlying operator dynamics to a biased and an unbiased persistent random walk respectively. In the latter case measurements additionally modify the ballistic decay to the perfect dephaser limit, with vanishing temporal entanglement, to an exponential decay, which we describe through a spatial transfer matrix method. This spatial dynamics is shown to be described by a non-Hermitian hopping model, exhibiting a PT-breaking transition at a critical measurement rate $p=1/2$. In all cases the peak value of the temporal entanglement barrier exhibits volume-law scaling for all measurement rates.</description>

      <title>Cyclic measurements and simplified quantum state tomography</title>

Abstract: Tomographic reconstruction of quantum states plays a fundamental role in benchmarking quantum systems and retrieving information from quantum computers. Among the informationally complete sets of quantum measurements the tight ones provide a linear reconstruction formula and minimize the propagation of statistical errors. However, implementing tight measurements in the lab is challenging due to the high number of required measurement projections, involving a series of experimental setup preparations. In this work, we introduce the notion of cyclic tight measurements, that allow us to perform full quantum state tomography while considering only repeated application of a single unitary-based quantum device during the measurement stage process. This type of measurements significantly simplifies the complexity of the experimental setup required to retrieve the quantum state of a physical system. Additionally, we design feasible setup preparation procedure that produce well-approximated cyclic tight measurements, in every finite dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum versus classical $P$-divisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $P$-divisibility is a central concept in both classical and quantum non-Markovian processes; in particular, it is strictly related to the notion of information backflow. When restricted to a fixed commutative algebra generated by a complete set of orthogonal projections, any quantum dynamics naturally provides a classical stochastic process. It is indeed well known that a quantum generator gives rise to a $P$-divisible quantum dynamics if and only if all its possible classical reductions give rise to divisible classical stochastic processes. Yet, this property does not hold if one operates a classical reduction of the quantum dynamical maps instead of their generators: as an example, for a unitary dynamics, $P$-divisibility of its classical reduction is inevitably lost, which thus exhibits information backflow. Instead, for some important classes of purely dissipative qubit evolutions, quantum $P$-divisibility always implies classical $P$-divisibility and thus lack of information backflow both in the quantum and classical scenarios. On the contrary, for a wide class of orthogonally covariant qubit dynamics, we show that loss of classical $P$-divisibility can originate from the classical reduction of a purely dissipative $P$-divisible quantum dynamics as in the unitary case. Moreover, such an effect can be interpreted in terms of information backflow, the information coming in being stored in the coherences of the time-evolving quantum state.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a universal logical gate set in error-detecting surface codes on a superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is essential for achieving large-scale practical quantum computation. Implementing arbitrary FTQC requires the execution of a universal gate set on logical qubits, which is highly challenging. Particularly, in the superconducting system, two-qubit gates on surface code logical qubits have not been realized. Here, we experimentally implement a logical CNOT gate along with arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates on distance-2 surface codes using the superconducting quantum processor \textit{Wukong}, thereby demonstrating a universal logical gate set. In the experiment, we demonstrate the transversal CNOT gate on a two-dimensional topological processor based on a tailored encoding circuit, at the cost of removing the ancilla qubits required for stabilizer measurements. Furthermore, we fault-tolerantly prepare logical Bell states and observe a violation of CHSH inequality, confirming the entanglement between logical qubits. Using the logical CNOT gate and an ancilla logical state, arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates are realized through gate teleportation. All logical gates are characterized on a complete state set and their fidelities are evaluated by logical Pauli transfer matrices. The demonstration of a universal logical gate set and the entangled logical states highlights significant aspects of FTQC on superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Charging a Quantum Battery Mediated by Parity-Deformed Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of parity deformation of the environmental field modes on the wireless charging performance of a qubit-based open quantum battery (QB) consisting of a qubit-battery and a qubit-charger, where there is no direct interaction between the qubits and battery is charged by the mediation of the environment. The parity deformation introduces field nonlinearities as well as qubit-environment intensity-dependent couplings. We analyze in detail charging characteristics, including the charging energy, efficiency and ergotropy in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, and show that the memory effects of mediator environment are critical in enhancing the charging performance. In the strong coupling regime, parity deformation of the environment fields can further trigger non-Markovian quantum memory of the charger-battery system, thereby enhancing the QB charging performance based on the non-Markovianity. Surprisingly, if the charging process is Markovian in the absence of the parity deformation, parity deformation is able to induce memory effects in the charger-battery dynamics and transforms the Markovian process to the non-Markovian one. This work highlights that proper engineering of the coupling to an environment can introduce an extra quantum memory source to the underlying charging process in favor of environment-mediated charging of the battery.</description>

      <title>Dynamical suppression of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect in Anyonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a fascinating phenomenon in nonequilibrium systems where eigenstates massively localize at the systems' boundaries, pumping (quasi-)particles loaded in these systems unidirectionally to the boundaries. Its interplay with many-body effects have been vigorously studied recently, and inter-particle repulsion or Fermi degeneracy pressure have been shown to limit the boundary accumulation induced by the NHSE both in their eigensolutions and dynamics. However, in this work we found that anyonic statistics can even more profoundly affect the NHSE dynamics, suppressing or even reversing the state dynamicss against the localizing direction of the NHSE. This phenomenon is found to be more pronounced when more particles are involved.The spreading of quantum information in this system shows even more exotic phenomena, where NHSE affects only the information dynamics for a thermal ensemble, but not that for a single initial state. Our results open up a new avenue on exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena arisen from the interplay between NHSE and anyonic statistics, and can potentially be demonstrated in ultracold atomic quantum simulators and quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum compilation is the process of converting a target unitary operation into a trainable unitary represented by a quantum circuit. It has a wide range of applications, including gate optimization, quantum-assisted compiling, quantum state preparation, and quantum dynamic simulation. Traditional quantum compilation usually optimizes circuits for a single target. However, many quantum systems require simultaneous optimization of multiple targets, such as thermal state preparation, time-dependent dynamic simulation, and others. To address this, we develop a multi-target quantum compilation algorithm to improve the performance and flexibility of simulating multiple quantum systems. Our benchmarks and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, highlighting the importance of multi-target optimization in advancing quantum computing. This work lays the groundwork for further development and evaluation of multi-target quantum compilation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement in Monitored Random Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the standard monitored random Clifford circuits from the perspective of $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ($\text{GHZ}_n$) entanglement, and find a series of new results about steady-state phase transitions, critical properties, and entanglement dynamics. For $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement, we identify a measurement-induced transitions between a phase with finite amount of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement and a phase with no such entanglement. This transition also depends on how the system is divided into three parties: A partitioning-induced phase transition is observed in circuits with open boundary condition. For multipartite $\text{GHZ}_{n\geq 4}$ entanglement, we find that they emerge exclusively at the measurement-induced criticality. For the dynamical aspect, we find that $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement does not grow gradually as the case of bipartite entanglement. Instead, it appears suddenly via a dynamical phase transition (DPT). Moreover, in some situations without measurements, it persists for a while and then dies through another DPT. These DPTs are not in the scope of standard formalism based on Loschmidt amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a neural-network architecture based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to find the ground states of quantum long-range models, specifically the transverse-field Ising model for spin-1/2 chains across different interaction regimes. Harnessing the transformer's capacity to capture long-range correlations, we compute the full phase diagram and critical properties of the model, in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. Our findings show that the ViT maintains high accuracy across the full phase diagram. We compare these results with previous numerical studies in the literature and, in particular, show that the ViT has a superior performance than a restricted-Boltzmann-machine-like ansatz.</description>

      <title>Optimal Mechanisms for Quantum Local Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework is still in its early stages, primarily conceptual, which poses challenges for its practical implementation in safeguarding quantum state privacy. This paper initiates a comprehensive algorithmic exploration of QLDP to establish a practical and viable QLDP framework for safeguarding quantum state privacy. QLDP utilizes a parameter $\epsilon$ to manage privacy leaks and ensure the privacy of individual quantum states. The optimization of the QLDP value $\epsilon$, denoted as $\epsilon^*$, for any quantum mechanism is addressed as an optimization problem. The introduction of quantum noise is shown to provide privacy protections similar to classical scenarios, with quantum depolarizing noise identified as the optimal unital privatization mechanism within the QLDP framework. Unital mechanisms represent a diverse set of quantum mechanisms that encompass frequently employed quantum noise types. Quantum depolarizing noise optimizes both fidelity and trace distance utilities, which are crucial metrics in the field of quantum computation and information, and can be viewed as a quantum counterpart to classical randomized response methods.
  Furthermore, a composition theorem is presented for the application of QLDP framework in distributed (spatially separated) quantum systems, ensuring the validity (additivity of QLDP value) irrespective of the states' independence, classical correlation, or entanglement (quantum correlation). The study further explores the trade-off between utility and privacy across different quantum noise mechanisms, including unital and non-unital quantum noise mechanisms, through both analytical and numerically experimental approaches. Meanwhile, this highlights the optimization of quantum depolarizing noise in QLDP framework.</description>

      <title>NetQIR: An Extension of QIR for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing has highlighted the need for scalable and efficient software infrastructures to fully exploit its potential. Current quantum processors face significant scalability constraints due to the limited number of qubits per chip. In response, distributed quantum computing (DQC) -- achieved by networking multiple quantum processor units (QPUs) -- is emerging as a promising solution. To support this paradigm, robust intermediate representations (IRs) are needed to translate high-level quantum algorithms into executable instructions suitable for distributed systems. This paper presents NetQIR, an extension of Microsoft's Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR), specifically designed to facilitate DQC by incorporating new instruction specifications. NetQIR was developed in response to the lack of abstraction at the network and hardware layers identified in the existing literature as a significant obstacle to effectively implementing distributed quantum algorithms. Based on this analysis, NetQIR introduces new essential abstraction features to support compilers in DQC contexts. It defines network communication instructions independent of specific hardware, abstracting the complexities of inter-QPU communication. Leveraging the QIR framework, NetQIR aims to bridge the gap between high-level quantum algorithm design and low-level hardware execution, thus promoting modular and scalable approaches to quantum software infrastructures for distributed applications.</description>

      <title>Modified Recursive QAOA for Exact Max-Cut Solutions on Bipartite Graphs: Closing the Gap Beyond QAOA Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm proposed with the goal of approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the MAX-CUT problem. It has been considered a potential candidate for achieving quantum advantage in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and has been extensively studied. However, the performance limitations of low-level QAOA have also been demonstrated across various instances. In this work, we first analytically prove the performance limitations of level-1 QAOA in solving the MAX-CUT problem on bipartite graphs. To this end, we derive an upper bound for the approximation ratio based on the average degree of bipartite graphs. Second, we demonstrate that Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), which recursively reduces graph size using QAOA as a subroutine, outperforms the level-1 QAOA. However, the performance of RQAOA exhibits limitations as the graph size increases. Finally, we show that RQAOA with a restricted parameter regime can fully address these limitations. Surprisingly, this modified RQAOA always finds the exact maximum cut for any bipartite graphs and even for a more general graph with parity-signed weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computation of \(\operatorname{tr}(AB)\) is essential in quantum science and artificial intelligence, yet classical methods for \( d \)-dimensional matrices \( A \) and \( B \) require \( O(d^2) \) complexity, which becomes infeasible for exponentially large systems. We introduce a quantum approach based on qudit shadow tomography that reduces both computational and storage complexities to \( O(\text{poly}(\log d)) \) in specific cases. This method is applicable to quantum density matrices \( A \) and Hermitian matrices \( B \) with given \(\operatorname{tr}(B)\) and \(\operatorname{tr}(B^2)\) bounded by a constant (referred to as BN-observables). We prove that this method guarantees at least a quadratic speedup for any quantum state \(\rho\) and BN-observable \( O \) in the worst case, and an exponential speedup in the approximately average case. For any \( n \)-qubit stabilizer state \(\rho\) and arbitrary BN-observable \( O \), we show that \(\operatorname{tr}(\rho O)\) can be efficiently estimated with \(\text{poly}(n)\) computations. Moreover, our approach significantly reduces the post-processing complexity in shadow tomography using random Clifford measurements, and it is applicable to arbitrary dimensions \( d \). These advances open new avenues for efficient high-dimensional data analysis and modeling.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is currently gaining significant attention, not only from the academic community but also from industry, due to its potential applications across several fields for addressing complex problems. For any practical problem which may be tackled using quantum computing, it is imperative to represent the data used onto a quantum computing system. Depending on the application, many different types of data and data structures occur, including regular numbers, higher-dimensional data structures, e.g., n-dimensional images, up to graphs. This report aims to provide an overview of existing methods for representing these data types on gate-based quantum computers.</description>

The mapping is exact in the one dimensional hard core limit, and for non-interacting particles in both one and two dimensions. The gate sequence has other applications, such as being used as part of a many-body interferometer which probes the existence of doublons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a compelling platform for both classical and quantum technologies. In particular, the past decade has witnessed a surge of novel ideas and developments, which may be overwhelming for newcomers to the field. This review provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and key applications of hBN, including quantum sensing, quantum key distribution, quantum computing, and quantum memory. Additionally, we highlight critical experimental and theoretical advances that have expanded the capabilities of hBN, in a cohesive and accessible manner. The objective is to equip readers with a comprehensive understanding of the diverse applications of hBN, and provide insights into ongoing research efforts.</description>

      <title>From Uncertainty Relations to Quantum Acceleration Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of quantum acceleration limit has been recently introduced for any unitary time evolution of quantum systems under arbitrary nonstationary Hamiltonians. While Alsing and Cafaro [Int. J. Geom. Methods Mod. Phys. 21, 2440009 (2024)] used the Robertson uncertainty relation in their derivation, Pati [arXiv:quant-ph/2312.00864 (2023)] employed the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relation to find the upper bound on the temporal rate of change of the speed of quantum evolutions. In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of these two alternative derivations for quantum systems specified by an arbitrary finite-dimensional projective Hilbert space. Furthermore, focusing on a geometric description of the quantum evolution of two-level quantum systems on a Bloch sphere under general time-dependent Hamiltonians, we find the most general conditions needed to attain the maximal upper bounds on the acceleration of the quantum evolution. In particular, these conditions are expressed explicitly in terms of two three-dimensional real vectors, the Bloch vector that corresponds to the evolving quantum state and the magnetic field vector that specifies the Hermitian Hamiltonian of the system. For pedagogical reasons, we illustrate our general findings for two-level quantum systems in explicit physical examples characterized by specific time-varying magnetic field configurations. Finally, we briefly comment on the extension of our considerations to higher-dimensional physical systems in both pure and mixed quantum states.</description>

      <title>QMA vs. QCMA and Pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a longstanding question of Aaronson and Kuperberg on whether there exists a classical oracle separating $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$. Settling this question in either direction would yield insight into the power of quantum proofs over classical proofs. We show that such an oracle exists if a certain quantum pseudorandomness conjecture holds. Roughly speaking, the conjecture posits that quantum algorithms cannot, by making few queries, distinguish between the uniform distribution over permutations versus permutations drawn from so-called "dense" distributions.
  Our result can be viewed as establishing a "win-win" scenario: either there is a classical oracle separation of $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$, or there is quantum advantage in distinguishing pseudorandom distributions on permutations.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Quantum Harmonic Otto Engine Under Hot Squeezed Thermal Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quantum harmonic Otto engine under a hot squeezed thermal reservoir with asymmetry between the two adiabatic branches introduced by considering different speeds of the driving protocols. In the first configuration, the driving protocol for the expansion stroke is sudden-switch in nature and compression stroke is driven adiabatically, while the second configuration deals with the converse situation. In both cases, we obtain analytic expressions for the upper bound on efficiency and efficiency at optimal work output, which reveals a significant difference between the two configurations. Additionally, we find that the maximum achievable efficiency in sudden expansion case is 1/2 only while it approaches unity for the sudden compression stroke. Further, we study the effect of increasing degree of squeezing on the efficiency and work output of the engine and indicate the optimal operational regime for both configurations under consideration. Finally, by studying the full phase-diagram of the Otto cycle we observe that the operational region of the engine mode grows with increasing squeezing at the expense of refrigeration regime.</description>

      <title>A Dequantized Algorithm for the Guided Local Hamiltonian Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local Hamiltonian (LH) problem, the quantum analog of the classical constraint satisfaction problem, is a cornerstone of quantum computation and complexity theory. It is known to be QMA-complete, indicating that it is challenging even for quantum computers. Interestingly, the guided local Hamiltonian (GLH) problem -- an LH problem with a guiding state that has a non-trivial overlap with the ground state -- can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer and is proved to be BQP-complete. This makes the GLH problem a valuable framework for exploring the fundamental separation between classical and quantum computation. Remarkably, the quantum algorithm for solving the GLH problem can be `dequantized' (i.e., made classically simulatable) under certain conditions, such as when only constant accuracy is required and when the Hamiltonian satisfies an unrealistic constant operator norm constraint. In this work, we relieve these restrictions by introducing a dequantized classical algorithm for a randomized quantum imaginary-time evolution quantum algorithm. We demonstrate that it achieves either limited or arbitrary constant accuracy, depending on whether the guiding state's overlap is general or exceeds a certain threshold. Crucially, our approach eliminates the constant operator norm constraint on the Hamiltonian, opening its applicability to realistic problems. Our results advance the classical solution of the GLH problem in practical settings and provide new insights into the boundary between classical and quantum computational power.</description>

      <title>Implementing transferable annealing protocols for combinatorial optimisation on neutral atom quantum processors: a case study on smart-charging of electric vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quantum optimisation paradigm, variational quantum algorithms face challenges with hardware-specific and instance-dependent parameter tuning, which can lead to computational inefficiencies. However, the promising potential of parameter transferability across problem instances with similar local structures has been demonstrated in the context of the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm. In this paper, we build on these advancements by extending the concept to annealing-based protocols, employing Bayesian optimisation to design robust quasi-adiabatic schedules. Our study reveals that, for Maximum Independent Set problems on graph families with shared geometries, optimal parameters naturally concentrate, enabling efficient transfer from smaller to larger instances. Experimental results on the Orion Alpha platform validate the effectiveness of our approach, scaling to problems with up to $100$ qubits. We apply this method to address a smart-charging optimisation problem on a real dataset. These findings highlight a scalable, resource-efficient path for hybrid optimisation strategies applicable in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Magnetization and Polarization of Coupled Nuclear Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the bulk magnetization of a sample is commonly assumed to be proportional to spin polarization, with each spin of the same type contributing equally to the measured signal. In this work, we prove the high-field theorem for general spin-I systems (where I is the spin quantum number): the total measurable NMR signal remains unaffected by the grouping of spins into equivalent units (e.g., molecules), provided the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium in the high field limit (hbar\omega_0 &gt;&gt; |H_spin-spin|, where \omega_0 is the Larmor frequency and |H_spin-spin| characterizes internal spin-spin interactions). The results are derived using both magnetization equations and density matrix formalism. The theorem, however, does not extend to conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium or such as zero- to ultralow-field NMR. We also present three educational problems designed to deepen understanding of the material in classroom settings. This work reinforces established principles in magnetic resonance but also highlights areas for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory for non-Hermitian continuum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most pronounced non-Hermitian phenomena is the non-Hermitian skin effect, which refers to the exponential localization of bulk eigenstates near the boundaries of non-Hermitian systems. Whereas non-Bloch band theory has been developed to describe the non-Hermitian skin effect in lattice systems, its counterpart in continuum systems still lacks a quantitative characterization. Here, we generalize the non-Bloch band theory to non-Hermitian continuum systems. In contrast to lattice systems for which the bulk Hamiltonian alone determines the non-Hermitian skin effect and energy spectrum, we find for continuum systems that the number of boundary conditions, i.e., the number of independent differential equations satisfied by wavefunctions at two boundaries, must also be included as essential information. We show that the appropriate discretization of continuum systems into lattice models requires matching the hopping range of the latter with the number of boundary conditions in the former. Furthermore, in periodic non-Hermitian continuum systems, we highlight the application of the transfer matrix in determining the generalized Brillouin zone. Our theory serves as a useful toolbox for investigating the rich non-Bloch physics in non-Hermitian continuum systems, such as photonic crystals, elastic media, and certain cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of non-Hermitian BCS superfluids in a dissipative asymmetric Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping and complex-valued interactions, which can be realized by collective one-body loss and two-body loss. By means of the NH BCS theory, we find that the weak asymmetry of the hopping does not affect the BCS superfluidity since it only affects the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the BdG Hamiltonian. Systematic analysis in the d-dimensional hypercubic lattices clarifies that the singularity in the density of states affects the phase boundary between the normal and dissipation-induced superfluid states. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by using the photoassociation techniques and a nonlocal Rabi coupling with local losses and postselecting null measurement outcomes with the use of the quantum-gas microscope.</description>

      <title>Imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. In the context of field theory, it is more appropriate to obtain the timelike entanglement entropy through the Wick rotation of the twist operators. It is found that, in certain special cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is related to the commutator of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. To evaluate these commutators, we employ the operator product expansion of the twist operators, revealing that the commutator is generally universal across most scenarios. However, in more general cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy proves to be more complex. We compute the commutator of the twist operators along with its higher-order temporal derivatives. Utilizing these results, we derive a modified formula for the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extend this formula to the case of strip subregion in higher dimensions. Our analysis shows that for the strip geometry, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is solely related to the commutators of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. The findings presented in this paper provide valuable insights into the imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy and its physical significance.</description>
