      <title>An efficient algorithm to compute the minimum free energy of interacting nucleic acid strands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information-encoding molecules RNA and DNA form a combinatorially large set of secondary structures through nucleic acid base pairing. Thermodynamic prediction algorithms predict favoured, or minimum free energy (MFE), secondary structures, and can assign an equilibrium probability to any structure via the partition function: a Boltzman-weighted sum over the set of secondary structures. MFE is NP-hard in the presence pseudoknots, base pairings that violate a restricted planarity condition. However, unpseudoknotted structures are amenable to dynamic programming: for a single DNA/RNA strand there are polynomial time algorithms for MFE and partition function. For multiple strands, the problem is more complicated due to entropic penalties. Dirks et al [SICOMP Review; 2007] showed that for O(1) strands, with N bases, there is a polynomial time in N partition function algorithm, however their technique did not generalise to MFE which they left open. We give the first polynomial time (O(N^4)) algorithm for unpseudoknotted multiple (O(1)) strand MFE, answering the open problem from Dirks et al. The challenge lies in considering rotational symmetry of secondary structures, a feature not immediately amenable to dynamic programming algorithms. Our proof has two main technical contributions: First, a polynomial upper bound on the number of symmetric secondary structures to be considered when computing rotational symmetry penalties. Second, that bound is leveraged by a backtracking algorithm to find the MFE in an exponential space of contenders. Our MFE algorithm has the same asymptotic run time as Dirks et al's partition function algorithm, suggesting efficient handling of rotational symmetry, although higher space complexity. It also seems reasonably tight in the number of strands since Codon, Hajiaghayi &amp; Thachuk [DNA27, 2021] have shown that unpseudoknotted MFE is NP-hard for O(N) strands.</description>

      <title>Structural Dynamics of Contractile Injection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of many macromolecular machines is characterized by chemically-mediated structural changes that achieve large scale functional deployment through local rearrangements of constitutive protein sub-units. Motivated by recent high resolution structural microscopy of a particular class of such machines, contractile injection systems (CIS), we construct a coarse grained semi-analytical model that recapitulates the geometry and bistable mechanics of CIS in terms of a minimal set of measurable physical parameters. We use this model to predict the size, shape and speed of a dynamical actuation front that underlies contraction. Scaling laws for the velocity and physical extension of the contraction front are consistent with our numerical simulations, and may be generally applicable to related systems.</description>

      <title>DiffBP: Generative Diffusion of 3D Molecules for Target Protein Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11214v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating molecules that bind to specific proteins is an important but challenging task in drug discovery. Previous works usually generate atoms in an auto-regressive way, where element types and 3D coordinates of atoms are generated one by one. However, in real-world molecular systems, the interactions among atoms in an entire molecule are global, leading to the energy function pair-coupled among atoms. With such energy-based consideration, the modeling of probability should be based on joint distributions, rather than sequentially conditional ones. Thus, the unnatural sequentially auto-regressive modeling of molecule generation is likely to violate the physical rules, thus resulting in poor properties of the generated molecules. In this work, a generative diffusion model for molecular 3D structures based on target proteins as contextual constraints is established, at a full-atom level in a non-autoregressive way. Given a designated 3D protein binding site, our model learns the generative process that denoises both element types and 3D coordinates of an entire molecule, with an equivariant network. Experimentally, the proposed method shows competitive performance compared with prevailing works in terms of high affinity with proteins and appropriate molecule sizes as well as other drug properties such as drug-likeness of the generated molecules.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>

Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The evolution of configurations is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids at extreme pressure-temperature conditions</title>

Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the building blocks of biomolecules may have originated in early Earth and other planets. Our findings contribute to an evolving understanding of the fundamental conditions necessary for life to arise.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for Machine Learning Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. It introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs.</description>

      <title>Any-Property-Conditional Molecule Generation with Self-Criticism using Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating novel molecules is challenging, with most representations leading to generative models producing many invalid molecules. Spanning Tree-based Graph Generation (STGG) is a promising approach to ensure the generation of valid molecules, outperforming state-of-the-art SMILES and graph diffusion models for unconditional generation. In the real world, we want to be able to generate molecules conditional on one or multiple desired properties rather than unconditionally. Thus, in this work, we extend STGG to multi-property-conditional generation. Our approach, STGG+, incorporates a modern Transformer architecture, random masking of properties during training (enabling conditioning on any subset of properties and classifier-free guidance), an auxiliary property-prediction loss (allowing the model to self-criticize molecules and select the best ones), and other improvements. We show that STGG+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditional generation, and reward maximization.</description>
