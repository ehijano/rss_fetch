      <title>Scaling of Computational Order Parameters in Rydberg Atom Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph states are computationally powerful quantum states with many applications including use as resource states for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC). We demonstrate construction of graph states on a Rydberg atom quantum analogue simulator. We show how an always-on interaction can be used to simultaneously entangle all Rydberg atoms into a graph state. We construct and implement many-body computational order parameters for graph states using non-local measurement-based logic operations in the Clifford group. The order parameters measure the efficacy of entanglement to allow MBQC on graph states of any size. We parameterize finite-size scaling of these order parameters. Our results define a route to efficiently build and test computational order in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Interference of longitudinal and transversal fragmentations in the Josephson tunneling dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of bosons in Josephson junctions have drawn much attention where the bosons are initially condensed. When interacting bosons tunnel back and forth along the junction, depletion and eventually fragmentation develop. Here, we pose the question how do fragmented bosons tunnel in a bosonic Josephson junction? To this end, we exploit the transverse degree-of-freedom of the junction to encode initial fragmentation to the bosonic cloud. We analyze the survival probability along the junction, fluctuations of particle positions across the junction, and the occupancy of the lowest single-particle states. The dynamics found is rich and includes the speed up of the collapse of density oscillations and slow down of the revival process. It is found that a fully fragmented state significantly accelerates the revival process compared to the conventional Bose-Einstein condensate. To explain the underlying many-body mechanism, we show that the initial fragmentation in the transverse direction interferes with the development of fragmentation in time along the junction. The dynamics of occupation in the first excited single-particle state defines whether interference of fragmentations occurs in the junction. The interference mechanism is a purely many-body effect that does not occur in the mean-field dynamics. All in all, we show that the interference of longitudinal and transversal fragmentations leads to new rules for macroscopic tunneling phenomena of interacting bosons in traps.</description>

      <title>Loop current states and their stability in small fractal lattices of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of interacting Bose-Einstein condensates on small Sierpinski gaskets. We study eigenstates which are characterised by cyclic supercurrents per each triangular plaquette ("loop" states). For noninteracting systems we find at least three classes of loop eigenmodes: standard; chaotic and periodic. Standard modes are those inherited from the basic three-site ring of condensates with phase differences locked to $2\pi/3$. Standard modes become unstable in the interacting system but only when the interaction exceeds a certain critical value $u_c$. Chaotic modes are characterised by very different circular currents per plaquette, so that the usual symmetry of loop currents is broken. Circular supercurrents associated with chaotic modes become chaotic for any finite interaction, signalling the loss of coherence between the condensates. Periodic modes are described by alternating populations and two different phase differences. The modes are self-similar and are present in all generations of Sierpinski gasket. When the interaction is included, the circular current of such a mode becomes periodic in time with the amplitude growing linearly with the interaction. Above a critical interaction the amplitude saturates signalling a transition to a macroscopic self-trapping state originally known from a usual Bose Josephson junction. We perform a systematic analysis of this rich physics.</description>

      <title>Modified mean field ansatz for charged polarons in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionic Bose polarons are quantum entities emerging from the interaction between an ion and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), featuring long-ranged interactions that can compete with the gas healing length. This can result in strong interparticle correlations and enhancement of gas density around the ion. One possible approach to describe this complex system with high accuracy relies on numerical treatment such as the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques. Nevertheless, it is computationally very expensive and does not easily allow to study the system dynamics. On the other hand, a mean-field based variational ansatz in the co-moving frame can capture a sizeable change in the gas density. We apply it to the case of regularized ion-atom potential and find that it qualitatively reproduces the full numerical results. In addition, we also study the system of two pinned ions, focusing on their effective interaction induced by the bath. This approach seems to be promising for studying transport and nonequilibrium dynamics of charged (bi)polarons in condensed media.</description>

      <title>Quantum mixtures of ultracold gases of neutral atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After decades of improvements in cooling techniques of several atomic species and in finding methods for the achievement of stable quantum mixtures, the field is now ready for an extensive use of such a versatile experimental platform for the investigation of a variety of physical problems. Among them, relevant examples are the dynamics of impurities in a quantum gas, the miscibility condition of different gases, the study of exotic topological structures, the interplay between magnetism and superfluidity, the formation of artificial molecules, or new few-body states. We illustrate the differences among possible quantum mixtures, be they homonuclear spin mixtures or heteronuclear ones, and show how they can be exploited to investigate a plethora of topics from the few-body to the many-body regime. In particular, we discuss quantum mixtures of ultracold gases under three different perspectives: systems made of a few atoms of different kinds, single impurities immersed in a host quantum gas, and quantum mixtures of two interacting gases. We restrict the discussion to single harmonic or flat traps, predominantly in a three-dimensional configuration. A selection of results on recent experiments and possible interesting future directions are given.</description>

      <title>Observation of magnon bound states in the long-range, anisotropic Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the recent years coherent, time-periodic modulation has been established as a versatile tool for realizing novel Hamiltonians. Using this approach, known as Floquet engineering, we experimentally realize a long-ranged, anisotropic Heisenberg model with tunable interactions in a trapped ion quantum simulator. We demonstrate that the spectrum of the model contains not only single magnon excitations but also composite magnon bound states. For the long-range interactions with the experimentally realized power-law exponent, the group velocity of magnons is unbounded. Nonetheless, for sufficiently strong interactions we observe bound states of these unconventional magnons which possess a non-diverging group velocity. By measuring the configurational mutual information between two disjoint intervals, we demonstrate the implications of the bound state formation on the entanglement dynamics of the system. Our observations provide key insights into the peculiar role of composite excitations in the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent collisional decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decoherence of a system of $N$ non-interacting heavy particles (atoms) due to coherent scattering with a background gas. We introduce a framework for computing the induced phase shift and loss of contrast for arbitrary preparations of $N$-particle quantum states. We find phase shifts that are inherently $(N\geq 2)$-body effects and may be searched for in future experiments. We analyze simple setups, including a two-mode approximation of an interferometer. We study fully entangled $N00N$ states, which resemble the correlated positions in a matter interferometer, as well as totally uncorrelated product states that are representative of a typical state in an atom interferometer. We find that the extent to which coherent enhancements increase the rate of decoherence depends on the observable of interest, state preparation, and details of the experimental design. In the context of future ultralow-recoil (e.g., light dark matter) searches with atom interferometers we conclude that: {\it i}) there exists a coherently enhanced scattering phase which can be searched for using standard (i.e., contrast/visibility and phase) interferometer observables; {\it ii}) although decoherence rates of one-body observables are {\it not} coherently enhanced, a coherently enhanced loss of contrast can still arise from dephasing; and {\it iii}) higher statistical moments (which are immediately accessible in a counting experiment) {\it are} coherently enhanced and may offer a new tool with which to probe the soft scattering of otherwise undetectable particles in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explore the influence of quantum-geometric effects on the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor, we adopt a BCS-BEC crossover approach to the multiband pyrochlore-Hubbard model near the critical temperature for superconductivity. Our self-consistent formulation for this three-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called zero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the coherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally, we show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper pairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in the dilute flat-band limit.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered Emergent Massive Nambu-Goldstone Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>
