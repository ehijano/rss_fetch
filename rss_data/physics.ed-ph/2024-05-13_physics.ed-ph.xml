      <title>Exploring Motion: Integrating Arduino in Physics Education for 21st Century Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study, analyzes were made for one-dimensional constant acceleration motion using the Arduino microcontroller and distance sensor, using the position and time values obtained for the movement of an object thrown from bottom to top until it falls to the ground. Within the scope of the study, the concepts of displacement, distance traveled, average speed and their relationships, position-time and speed-time graphs and kinematic equations were analyzed respectively. It was observed that all the results obtained from the analyzes were compatible with the theoretical results obtained using the equations. This study, in which innovative experimental activities and comprehensive analyzes for both constant acceleration motion and motion graphs and flight movements are carried out at a very low cost, has a high reproducibility potential as it contains easily accessible materials. With this type of study, it is very important and necessary to add training for 21st century skills such as material development, programming, and data analysis to physics teaching processes in the age of technology.</description>

      <title>AI and Machine Learning for Next Generation Science Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in science assessments. The paper begins with a discussion of the Framework for K-12 Science Education, which calls for a shift from conceptual learning to knowledge-in-use. This shift necessitates the development of new types of assessments that align with the Framework's three dimensions: science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts. The paper further highlights the limitations of traditional assessment methods like multiple-choice questions, which often fail to capture the complexities of scientific thinking and three-dimensional learning in science. It emphasizes the need for performance-based assessments that require students to engage in scientific practices like modeling, explanation, and argumentation. The paper achieves three major goals: reviewing the current state of ML-based assessments in science education, introducing a framework for scoring accuracy in ML-based automatic assessments, and discussing future directions and challenges. It delves into the evolution of ML-based automatic scoring systems, discussing various types of ML, like supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. These systems can provide timely and objective feedback, thus alleviating the burden on teachers. The paper concludes by exploring pre-trained models like BERT and finetuned ChatGPT, which have shown promise in assessing students' written responses effectively.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Simulation of Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes an algorithmic system called SQT for the computer simulation of a wide class of quantum experiments on entangled particles. SQT provides an initialization process and measurement processes with visual outputs and a means of connecting these in software to make the simulator for a given experiment in Quantum Mechanics. The statistical behavior of the Quantum Mechanical system is replicated by incorporating the probabilities that are observed in real world quantum experiments. SQT is thus a tool to provide educational understanding of quantum systems and this tool removes the mystery surrounding entangled particles. It shows that only initial measurement probabilities and conditional probabilities of transition from the previous state and no earlier to the next state are sufficient inputs for the simulator to replicate all Quantum Mechanical experiments in the simulator and no complex numbers must be entered into the simulator. The simulator, unlike the real world quantum system, can display the hidden sub-quantum state after which it can be seen that there is no spooky interaction between entangled particles at all. SQT therefore provides a new interpretation of quantum phenomena that may well replace the Copenhagen interpretation founded by Niels Bohr and it answers Einsteins final question regarding whether Quantum Mechanics can be considered a complete theory or not.</description>

      <title>A computational model for the evolution of learning physical micro-contents in peer instruction methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important active methodologies for physics learning developed in recent years is peer instruction. Its technique has allowed, among other things, to monitor students' conceptual learning. In this sense, \textcite{PhysRevSTPER.6.020105} has proposed a model that seeks to understand the dynamics of this methodology. However, her model is very phenomenological and overlooks fundamental aspects such as the cognitive process that students follow during interaction with their peers, the role of the instructor, the connection between content and student characteristics, and long-term learning. The objective of this thesis was to develop a computational model based on neurocognitive principles that aimed to address the shortcomings found in Nitta's work. The model was formulated, simulated, and validated based on several field studies on the learning of one-dimensional graphical interpretation and the falling of bodies among science and engineering students in Bogot\'a, Colombia</description>

      <title>Realizing Visual Question Answering for Education: GPT-4V as a Multimodal AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educational scholars have analyzed various image data acquired from teaching and learning situations, such as photos that shows classroom dynamics, students' drawings with regard to the learning content, textbook illustrations, etc. Unquestioningly, most qualitative analysis of and explanation on image data have been conducted by human researchers, without machine-based automation. It was partially because most image processing artificial intelligence models were not accessible to general educational scholars or explainable due to their complex deep neural network architecture. However, the recent development of Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques is accomplishing usable visual language models, which receive from the user a question about the given image and returns an answer, both in natural language. Particularly, GPT-4V released by OpenAI, has wide opened the state-of-the-art visual langauge model service so that VQA could be used for a variety of purposes. However, VQA and GPT-4V have not yet been applied to educational studies much. In this position paper, we suggest that GPT-4V contributes to realizing VQA for education. By 'realizing' VQA, we denote two meanings: (1) GPT-4V realizes the utilization of VQA techniques by any educational scholars without technical/accessibility barrier, and (2) GPT-4V makes educational scholars realize the usefulness of VQA to educational research. Given these, this paper aims to introduce VQA for educational studies so that it provides a milestone for educational research methodology. In this paper, chapter II reviews the development of VQA techniques, which primes with the release of GPT-4V. Chapter III reviews the use of image analysis in educational studies. Chapter IV demonstrates how GPT-4V can be used for each research usage reviewed in Chapter III, with operating prompts provided. Finally, chapter V discusses the future implications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction for Kids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No one should wait until college to get acquainted with core concepts of quantum information. Given the human bias of favouring the familiar over the unknown, early exposure to concepts of quantum information helps learners build stronger appetence for the field, as well as allowing them to develop an intuitive approach to it. In this work, I present an intuitive gamified approach to one of the core concepts in quantum error correction: the stabiliser formalism.</description>
