      <title>Observation of prethermalization in weakly nonintegrable unitary maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate prethermalization by studying the statistical properties of the time-dependent largest Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda(t)$ for unitary-circuit maps upon approaching integrability. We follow the evolution of trajectories for different initial conditions and compute the mean $\mu(t)$ and standard deviation $\sigma(t)$ of $\Lambda(t)$. Thermalization implies a temporal decay $\sigma \sim t^{-1/2}$ at a converged finite value of $\mu$. We report prethermalization plateaus that persist for long times where both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ appear to have converged to finite values, seemingly implying differing saturated Lyapunov exponent values for different trajectories. The lifetime of such plateaus furnishes a novel time scale characterizing the thermalization dynamics of many-body systems close to integrability. We also find that the plateaus converge to their respective thermal values for long enough times.</description>

      <title>Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Non-autonomous standard nontwist map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Area-preserving nontwist maps locally violate the twist condition, giving rise to shearless curves. Nontwist systems appear in different physical contexts, such as plasma physics, climate physics, classical mechanics, etc. Generic properties of nontwist maps are captured by the standard nontwist map, which depends on a convection parameter $a$ and a modulation coefficient $b$. In the spirit of non-autonomous systems, we consider the standard nontwist map (SNM) with a linearly increasing modulation coefficient, and we investigate the evolution of an ensemble of points on the phase space that initially lies on the shearless invariant curve in the initial state, called shearless snapshot torus. Differently from the SNM with constant parameters -- where we can see different scenarios of collision/annihilation of periodic orbits leading to global transport, depending on the region in the parameter space -- for the SNM with time-dependent parameters, the route to chaos is not only related to the path in the $(a, b)$ parameter space, but also to the scenario of the evolution of parameter $b_n$. In this work, we identify power-law relationships between key parameters for the chaotic transition and the iteration time. Additionally, we analyze system reversibility during the chaotic transition and demonstrate an extra transport, where parameter variation modifies the diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <title>Multiple Local and Global Bifurcations and Their Role in Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quorum sensing governs bacterial communication, playing a crucial role in regulating population behaviour. We propose a mathematical model that uncovers chaotic dynamics within quorum sensing networks, highlighting challenges to predictability. The model explores interactions between autoinducers and two bacterial subtypes, revealing oscillatory dynamics in both a constant autoinducer sub-model and the full three-component model. In the latter case, we find that the complicated dynamics can be explained by the presence of homoclinic Shilnikov bifurcations. We employed a combination of normal form analysis and numerical continuation methods to analyse the system.</description>

      <title>Explicit dynamical properties of the Pelikan random map in the chaotic region and at the intermittent critical point towards the non-chaotic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pelikan random trajectories $x_t \in [0,1[$ are generated by choosing the chaotic doubling map $x_{t+1}=2 x_t [mod 1]$ with probability $p$ and the non-chaotic half-contracting map $x_{t+1}=\frac{x_t}{2}$ with probability $(1-p)$. We compute various dynamical observables as a function of the parameter $p$ via two perspectives. In the first perspective, we focus on the closed dynamics within the subspace of probability densities that remain constant on the binary-intervals $x \in [ 2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}[$ partitioning the interval $x \in [0,1[$ : the dynamics for the weights $\pi_t(n)$ of these intervals corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $n \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ with resetting occurring with probability $p$ from the origin $n=0$ towards any site $n$ drawn with the distribution $2^{-n-1}$. In the second perspective, we study the Pelikan dynamics for any initial condition $x_0$ via the binary decomposition $x_t = \sum_{l=1}^{+\infty} \frac{\sigma_l (t)}{2^l} $, where the dynamics for the half-infinite lattice $l=1,2,..$ of the binary variables $\sigma_l(t) \in \{0,1\}$ can be reformulated in terms of two global variables : $z_t$ corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $z \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ that may remain at the origin $z=0$ with probability $p$, while $F_t \in \{0,1,2,..t\}$ counts the number of time-steps $\tau \in [0,t-1]$ where $z_{\tau+1}=0=z_{\tau}$ and represents the number of the binary coefficients of the initial condition that have been erased. We discuss typical and large deviations properties in the chaotic region $\frac{1}{2}&lt;p&lt;1 $ as well as at the intermittent critical point $p_c=\frac{1}{2}$ towards the non-chaotic region $0&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>
