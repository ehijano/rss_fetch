      <title>Dispersion on Time-Varying Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion involves the coordination of $k \leq n$ agents on a graph of size $n$ to reach a configuration where at each node at most one agent can be present. It is a well-studied problem. Also, this problem is studied on dynamic graphs with $n$ nodes where at each discrete time step the graph is a connected sub-graph of the complete graph $K_n$. An optimal algorithm is provided assuming global communication and 1-hop visibility of the agents. How this problem pans out on Time-Varying Graphs (TVG) is an open question in the literature. In this work we study this problem on TVG where at each discrete time step the graph is a connected sub-graph of an underlying graph $G$ (known as a footprint) consisting of $n$ nodes. We have the following results even if only one edge from $G$ is missing in the connected sub-graph at any time step and all agents start from a rooted initial configuration. Even with unlimited memory at each agent and 1-hop visibility, it is impossible to solve dispersion for $n$ co-located agents on a TVG in the local communication model. Furthermore, even with unlimited memory at each agent but without 1-hop visibility, it is impossible to achieve dispersion for $n$ co-located agents in the global communication model. From the positive side, the existing algorithm for dispersion on dynamic graphs with the assumptions of global communication and 1-hop visibility works on TVGs as well. This fact and the impossibility results push us to come up with a modified definition of the dispersion problem on TVGs, as one needs to start with more than $n$ agents if the objective is to drop the strong assumptions of global communication and 1-hop visibility. Then, we provide an algorithm to solve the modified dispersion problem on TVG starting with $n+1$ agents with $O(\log n)$ memory per agent while dropping both the assumptions of global communication and 1-hop visibility.</description>

      <title>Slim-ABC: An Optimized Atomic Broadcast Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem is a fundamental challenge in distributed systems, focusing on achieving reaching an agreement among parties, some of which may behave maliciously. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, there has been significant interest in developing atomic broadcast protocols, which facilitate agreement on a subset of parties' requests. However, these protocols often come with high communication complexity ($O(ln^2 + \lambda n^3 \log n)$, where $l$ is the bit length of the input, $n$ is the number of parties, and $\lambda$ represents the security parameter bit length). This can lead to inefficiency, especially when the requests across parties exhibit little variation, resulting in unnecessary resource consumption. In this paper, we introduce Slim-ABC, a novel atomic broadcast protocol that eliminates the $O(ln^2 + \lambda n^3 \log n)$ term associated with traditional atomic broadcast protocols. While Slim-ABC reduces the number of accepted requests, it significantly mitigates resource wastage, making it more efficient. The protocol leverages the asynchronous common subset and provable-broadcast mechanisms to achieve a communication complexity of $O(ln^2 + \lambda n^2)$. Despite the trade-off in accepted requests, Slim-ABC maintains robust security by allowing only a fraction ($f+1$) of parties to broadcast requests. We present an extensive efficiency analysis of Slim-ABC, evaluating its performance across key metrics such as message complexity, communication complexity, and time complexity. Additionally, we provide a rigorous security analysis, demonstrating that Slim-ABC satisfies the \textit{agreement}, \textit{validity}, and \textit{totality} properties of the asynchronous common subset protocol.</description>

      <title>Multi Armed Bandit Algorithms Based Virtual Machine Allocation Policy for Security in Multi-Tenant Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a secure and dynamic VM allocation strategy for multi-tenant distributed systems using the Thompson sampling approach. The method proves more effective and secure compared to epsilon-greedy and upper confidence bound methods, showing lower regret levels.,Initially, VM allocation was static, but the unpredictable nature of attacks necessitated a dynamic approach. Historical VM data was analyzed to understand attack responses, with rewards granted for unsuccessful attacks and reduced for successful ones, influencing regret levels.,The paper introduces a Multi Arm Bandit-based VM allocation policy, utilizing a Weighted Average Ensemble Learning algorithm trained on known attacks and non-attacks. This ensemble approach outperforms traditional algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, K Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost.,For suspicious activity detection, a Stacked Anomaly Detector algorithm is proposed, trained on known non-attacks. This method surpasses existing techniques such as Isolation Forest and PCA-based approaches.,Overall, this paper presents an advanced solution for VM allocation policies, enhancing cloud-based system security through a combination of dynamic allocation, ensemble learning, and anomaly detection techniques.</description>

      <title>CONFINE: Preserving Data Secrecy in Decentralized Process Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the contemporary business landscape, collaboration across multiple organizations offers a multitude of opportunities, including reduced operational costs, enhanced performance, and accelerated technological advancement. The application of process mining techniques in an inter-organizational setting, exploiting the recorded process event data, enables the coordination of joint effort and allows for a deeper understanding of the business. Nevertheless, considerable concerns pertaining to data confidentiality emerge, as organizations frequently demonstrate a reluctance to expose sensitive data demanded for process mining, due to concerns related to privacy and security risks. The presence of conflicting interests among the parties involved can impede the practice of open data sharing. To address these challenges, we propose our approach and toolset named CONFINE, which we developed with the intent of enabling process mining on process event data from multiple providers while preserving the confidentiality and integrity of the original records. To ensure that the presented interaction protocol steps are secure and that the processed information is hidden from both involved and external actors, our approach is based on a decentralized architecture and consists of trusted applications running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). In this demo paper, we provide an overview of the core components and functionalities as well as the specific details of its application.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Based Scheduling Mechanism for Scalable and Resource-Efficient Centralized Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to address the challenges of deploying complex robotic software in large-scale systems, i.e., Centralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Controllers (CNMPCs) for multi-agent systems. The proposed approach is based on a Kubernetes-based scheduling mechanism designed to monitor and optimize the operation of CNMPCs, while addressing the scalability limitation of centralized control schemes. By leveraging a cluster in a real-time cloud environment, the proposed mechanism effectively offloads the computational burden of CNMPCs. Through experiments, we have demonstrated the effectiveness and performance of our system, especially in scenarios where the number of robots is subject to change. Our work contributes to the advancement of cloud-based control strategies and lays the foundation for enhanced performance in cloud-controlled robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Fast State Restoration in LLM Serving with HCache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of LLM usage today, e.g., multi-round conversation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), makes contextual states (i.e., KV cache) reusable across user requests. Given the capacity constraints of GPU memory, only a limited number of contexts can be cached on GPU for reusing. Existing inference systems typically evict part of the KV cache and restore it by recomputing it from the original tokens or offloading it to host storage for later retrieval, both of which introduce substantial computational or I/O overheads. We propose HCache, a novel LLM state restoration method. Its key idea is to restore LLM states from intermediate activations and thus utilize computational and I/O resources with low overhead. We enhance HCache with two techniques, including i) a bubble-free restoration scheduler that integrates resource-complementary methods to optimize the balance between computation and IO tasks; and ii) a chunk-based storage manager to address the layout mismatch issue (i.e., layer-before-token saving versus token-before-layer restoration). Our evaluations, conducted using real-world tasks, show that HCache reduces the TTFT by up to 1.93X compared to KV offload while consuming 1.92-2.40X less storage space; compared to token recomputation, HCache achieves up to 5.73X reduction in TTFT.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Liquid-cooled Supercomputers as Demonstrated at Exascale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ExaDigiT, an open-source framework for developing comprehensive digital twins of liquid-cooled supercomputers. It integrates three main modules: (1) a resource allocator and power simulator, (2) a transient thermo-fluidic cooling model, and (3) an augmented reality model of the supercomputer and central energy plant. The framework enables the study of "what-if" scenarios, system optimizations, and virtual prototyping of future systems. Using Frontier as a case study, we demonstrate the framework's capabilities by replaying six months of system telemetry for systematic verification and validation. Such a comprehensive analysis of a liquid-cooled exascale supercomputer is the first of its kind. ExaDigiT elucidates complex transient cooling system dynamics, runs synthetic or real workloads, and predicts energy losses due to rectification and voltage conversion. Throughout our paper, we present lessons learned to benefit HPC practitioners developing similar digital twins. We envision the digital twin will be a key enabler for sustainable, energy-efficient supercomputing.</description>

      <title>A Seesaw Model Attack Algorithm for Distributed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Byzantine attack problem within the context of model training in distributed learning systems. While ensuring the convergence of current model training processes, common solvers (e.g. SGD, Adam, RMSProp, etc.) can be easily compromised by malicious nodes in these systems. Consequently, the training process may either converge slowly or even diverge. To develop effective secure distributed learning solvers, it is crucial to first examine attack methods to assess the robustness of these solvers. In this work, we contribute to the design of attack strategies by initially highlighting the limitations of finite-norm attacks. We then introduce the seesaw attack, which has been demonstrated to be more effective than the finite-norm attack. Through numerical experiments, we evaluate the efficacy of the seesaw attack across various gradient aggregation rules.</description>

      <title>Real-World Data and Calibrated Simulation Suite for Offline Training of Reinforcement Learning Agents to Optimize Energy and Emission in Buildings for Environmental Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercial office buildings contribute 17 percent of Carbon Emissions in the US, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), and improving their efficiency will reduce their environmental burden and operating cost. A major contributor of energy consumption in these buildings are the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) devices. HVAC devices form a complex and interconnected thermodynamic system with the building and outside weather conditions, and current setpoint control policies are not fully optimized for minimizing energy use and carbon emission. Given a suitable training environment, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent is able to improve upon these policies, but training such a model, especially in a way that scales to thousands of buildings, presents many practical challenges. Most existing work on applying RL to this important task either makes use of proprietary data, or focuses on expensive and proprietary simulations that may not be grounded in the real world. We present the Smart Buildings Control Suite, the first open source interactive HVAC control dataset extracted from live sensor measurements of devices in real office buildings. The dataset consists of two components: six years of real-world historical data from three buildings, for offline RL, and a lightweight interactive simulator for each of these buildings, calibrated using the historical data, for online and model-based RL. For ease of use, our RL environments are all compatible with the OpenAI gym environment standard. We also demonstrate a novel method of calibrating the simulator, as well as baseline results on training an RL agent on the simulator, predicting real-world data, and training an RL agent directly from data. We believe this benchmark will accelerate progress and collaboration on building optimization and environmental sustainability research.</description>

      <title>180 Days After EIP-4844: Will Blob Sharing Solve Dilemma for Small Rollups?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of blobs through EIP-4844 has significantly reduced the Data Availability (DA) costs for rollups on Ethereum. However, due to the fixed size of blobs at 128 KB, rollups with low data throughput face a dilemma: they either use blobs inefficiently or decrease the frequency of DA submissions. Blob sharing, where multiple rollups share a single blob, has been proposed as a solution to this problem. This paper examines the effectiveness of blob sharing based on real-world data collected approximately six months after the implementation of EIP-4844. By simulating cost changes using a simple blob sharing format, we demonstrate that blob sharing can substantially improve the costs and DA service quality for small rollups, effectively resolving their dilemma. Notably, we observed cost reductions in USD exceeding 90% for most of the rollups when they cooperate, attributable to the smoothing effect of the blob base fee achieved through blob sharing.</description>

      <title>Lazy Qubit Reordering for Accelerating Parallel State-Vector-based Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes two quantum operation scheduling methods for accelerating parallel state-vector-based quantum circuit simulation using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed methods reduce all-to-all communication caused by qubit reordering (QR), which can dominate the overhead of parallel simulation. Our approach eliminates redundant QRs by introducing intentional delays in QR communications such that multiple QRs can be aggregated into a single QR. The delays are carefully introduced based on the principles of time-space tiling, or a cache optimization technique for classical computers, which we use to arrange the execution order of quantum operations. Moreover, we present an extended scheduling method for the hierarchical interconnection of GPU cluster systems to avoid slow inter-node communication. We develop these methods tailored for two primary procedures in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation: quantum state update (QSU) and expectation value computation (EVC). Experimental validation on 32-GPU executions demonstrates acceleration in QSU and EVC -- up to 54$\times$ and 606$\times$, respectively -- compared to existing methods. Moreover, our extended scheduling method further reduced communication time by up to 15\% in a two-layered interconnected cluster system. Our approach is useful for any quantum circuit simulations, including QSU and/or EVC.</description>

      <title>MindFlayer: Efficient Asynchronous Parallel SGD in the Presence of Heterogeneous and Random Worker Compute Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing the expectation of smooth nonconvex functions with the help of several parallel workers whose role is to compute stochastic gradients. In particular, we focus on the challenging situation where the workers' compute times are arbitrarily heterogeneous and random. In the simpler regime characterized by arbitrarily heterogeneous but deterministic compute times, Tyurin and Richt\'arik (NeurIPS 2023) recently designed the first theoretically optimal asynchronous SGD method, called Rennala SGD, in terms of a novel complexity notion called time complexity. The starting point of our work is the observation that Rennala SGD can have arbitrarily bad performance in the presence of random compute times -- a setting it was not designed to handle. To advance our understanding of stochastic optimization in this challenging regime, we propose a new asynchronous SGD method, for which we coin the name MindFlayer SGD. Our theory and empirical results demonstrate the superiority of MindFlayer SGD over existing baselines, including Rennala SGD, in cases when the noise is heavy tailed.</description>

      <title>FedBiP: Heterogeneous One-Shot Federated Learning with Personalized Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL), a special decentralized machine learning paradigm, has recently gained significant attention. OSFL requires only a single round of client data or model upload, which reduces communication costs and mitigates privacy threats compared to traditional FL. Despite these promising prospects, existing methods face challenges due to client data heterogeneity and limited data quantity when applied to real-world OSFL systems. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have shown remarkable advancements in synthesizing high-quality images through pretraining on large-scale datasets, thereby presenting a potential solution to overcome these issues. However, directly applying pretrained LDM to heterogeneous OSFL results in significant distribution shifts in synthetic data, leading to performance degradation in classification models trained on such data. This issue is particularly pronounced in rare domains, such as medical imaging, which are underrepresented in LDM's pretraining data. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Bi-Level Personalization (FedBiP), which personalizes the pretrained LDM at both instance-level and concept-level. Hereby, FedBiP synthesizes images following the client's local data distribution without compromising the privacy regulations. FedBiP is also the first approach to simultaneously address feature space heterogeneity and client data scarcity in OSFL. Our method is validated through extensive experiments on three OSFL benchmarks with feature space heterogeneity, as well as on challenging medical and satellite image datasets with label heterogeneity.

      <title>DIMS: Distributed Index for Similarity Search in Metric Spaces</title>

Abstract: Similarity search finds objects that are similar to a given query object based on a similarity metric. As the amount and variety of data continue to grow, similarity search in metric spaces has gained significant attention. Metric spaces can accommodate any type of data and support flexible distance metrics, making similarity search in metric spaces beneficial for many real-world applications, such as multimedia retrieval, personalized recommendation, trajectory analytics, data mining, decision planning, and distributed servers. However, existing studies mostly focus on indexing metric spaces on a single machine, which faces efficiency and scalability limitations with increasing data volume and query amount. Recent advancements in similarity search turn towards distributed methods, while they face challenges including inefficient local data management, unbalanced workload, and low concurrent search efficiency. To this end, we propose DIMS, an efficient Distributed Index for similarity search in Metric Spaces. First, we design a novel three-stage heterogeneous partition to achieve workload balance. Then, we present an effective three-stage indexing structure to efficiently manage objects. We also develop concurrent search methods with filtering and validation techniques that support efficient distributed similarity search. Additionally, we devise a cost-based optimization model to balance communication and computation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIMS significantly outperforms existing distributed similarity search approaches.</description>

      <title>A Starting Point for Dynamic Community Detection with Leiden Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world graphs often evolve over time, making community or cluster detection a crucial task. In this technical report, we extend three dynamic approaches - Naive-dynamic (ND), Delta-screening (DS), and Dynamic Frontier (DF) - to our multicore implementation of the Leiden algorithm, known for its high-quality community detection. Our experiments, conducted on a server with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, show that ND, DS, and DF Leiden achieve average speedups of 1.37x, 1.47x, and 1.98x on large graphs with random batch updates, compared to the Static Leiden algorithm - while scaling at a rate of 1.6x for every doubling of threads. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply dynamic approaches to the Leiden algorithm. We hope these early results pave the way for further development of dynamic approaches for evolving graphs.</description>

      <title>LayerKV: Optimizing Large Language Model Serving with Layer-wise KV Cache Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.</description>

      <title>Generic Multicast (Extended Version)</title>

Abstract: Communication primitives play a central role in modern computing. They offer a panel of reliability and ordering guarantees for messages, enabling the implementation of complex distributed interactions. In particular, atomic broadcast is a pivotal abstraction for implementing fault-tolerant distributed services. This primitive allows disseminating messages across the system in a total order. There are two group communication primitives closely related to atomic broadcast. Atomic multicast permits targeting a subset of participants, possibly stricter than the whole system. Generic broadcast leverages the semantics of messages to order them only where necessary (that is when they conflict). In this paper, we propose to combine all these primitives into a single, more general one, called generic multicast. We formally specify the guarantees offered by generic multicast and present efficient algorithms. Compared to prior works, our solutions offer appealing properties in terms of time and space complexity. In particular, when a run is conflict-free, that is no two messages conflict, a message is delivered after at most three message delays.</description>

      <title>SeBS-Flow: Benchmarking Serverless Cloud Function Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serverless computing has emerged as a prominent paradigm, with a significant adoption rate among cloud customers. While this model offers advantages such as abstraction from the deployment and resource scheduling, it also poses limitations in handling complex use cases due to the restricted nature of individual functions. Serverless workflows address this limitation by orchestrating multiple functions into a cohesive application. However, existing serverless workflow platforms exhibit significant differences in their programming models and infrastructure, making fair and consistent performance evaluations difficult in practice. To address this gap, we propose the first serverless workflow benchmarking suite SeBS-Flow, providing a platform-agnostic workflow model that enables consistent benchmarking across various platforms. SeBS-Flow includes six real-world application benchmarks and four microbenchmarks representing different computational patterns. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three major cloud platforms, assessing performance, cost, scalability, and runtime deviations. We make our benchmark suite open-source, enabling rigorous and comparable evaluations of serverless workflows over time.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Adaptively Secure Any-Trust Distributed Key Generation and All-hands Checkpointing</title>

Abstract: The classical distributed key generation protocols (DKG) are resurging due to their widespread applications in blockchain. While efforts have been made to improve DKG communication, practical large-scale deployments are still yet to come due to various challenges, including the heavy computation and communication (particularly broadcast) overhead in their adversarial cases. In this paper, we propose a practical DKG for DLog-based cryptosystems, which achieves (quasi-)linear computation and communication per-node cost with the help of a common coin, even in the face of the maximal amount of Byzantine nodes. Moreover, our protocol is secure against adaptive adversaries, which can corrupt less than half of all nodes. The key to our improvements lies in delegating the most costly operations to an Any-Trust group together with a set of techniques for adaptive security. This group is randomly sampled and consists of a small number of individuals. The population only trusts that at least one member in the group is honest, without knowing which one. Moreover, we present a generic transformer that enables us to efficiently deploy a conventional distributed protocol like our DKG, even when the participants have different weights. Additionally, we introduce an extended broadcast channel based on a blockchain and data dispersal network (such as IPFS), enabling reliable broadcasting of arbitrary-size messages at the cost of constant-size blockchain storage.</description>

      <title>Stateful Large Language Model Serving with Pensieve</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are wildly popular today and it is important to serve them efficiently. Existing LLM serving systems are stateless across requests. Consequently, when LLMs are used in the common setting of multi-turn conversations, a growing log of the conversation history must be processed alongside any request by the serving system at each turn, resulting in repeated processing.
  In this paper, we design $Pensieve$, a system optimized for multi-turn conversation LLM serving. $Pensieve$ maintains the conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history to avoid duplicate processing. $Pensieve$'s multi-tier caching strategy can utilize both GPU and CPU memory to efficiently store and retrieve cached data. $Pensieve$ also generalizes the recent PagedAttention kernel to support attention between multiple input tokens with a GPU cache spread over non-contiguous memory. Our evaluation shows that $Pensieve$ can achieve $1.14$-$3.0\times$ the throughput of vLLM and TensorRT-LLM and significantly reduce latency.</description>

      <title>Space-time deterministic graph rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-terminating graph rewriting models, whose local rules are applied non-deterministically -- and yet enjoy a strong form of determinism, namely space-time determinism. Of course in the case of terminating computation it is well-known that the mess introduced by asynchronous rule applications may not matter to the end result, as confluence conspires to produce a unique normal form. In the context of non-terminating computation however, confluence is a very weak property, and (almost) synchronous rule applications is always preferred e.g. when it comes to simulating dynamical systems. Here we provide sufficient conditions so that asynchronous local rule applications conspire to produce well-determined events in the space-time unfolding of the graph, regardless of their application orders. Our first example is an asynchronous simulation of a dynamical system. Our second example features time dilation, in the spirit of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Model-guided Fuzzing of Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a coverage-guided testing algorithm for distributed systems implementations. Our main innovation is the use of an abstract formal model of the system that is used to define coverage. Such abstract models are frequently developed in early phases of protocol design and verification but are infrequently used at testing time. We show that guiding random test generation using model coverage can be effective in covering interesting points in the implementation state space. We have implemented a fuzzer for distributed system implementations and abstract models written in TLA+. Our algorithm shows better coverage over purely random exploration as well as random exploration guided by different notions of scheduler coverage and mutation. In particular, we show consistently higher coverage and detect bugs faster on implementations of distributed consensus protocols such as those in Etcd-raft and RedisRaft. Moreover, we discovered 13 previously unknown bugs in their implementations, four of which could only be detected by model-guided fuzzing.</description>
