      <title>Ginzburg--Landau Functionals in the Large-Graph Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ginzburg--Landau (GL) functionals on graphs, which are relaxations of graph-cut functionals on graphs, have yielded a variety of insights in image segmentation and graph clustering. In this paper, we study large-graph limits of GL functionals by taking a functional-analytic view of graphs as nonlocal kernels. For a graph $W_n$ with $n$ nodes, the corresponding graph GL functional $\GL^{W_n}_\ep$ is an energy for functions on $W_n$. We minimize GL functionals on sequences of growing graphs that converge to functions called graphons. For such sequences of graphs, we show that the graph GL functional $\Gamma$-converges to a continuous and nonlocal functional that we call the \emph{graphon GL functional}. We also investigate the sharp-interface limits of the graph GL and graphon GL functionals, and we relate these limits to a nonlocal total variation. We express the limiting GL functional in terms of Young measures and thereby obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the variational problem in the large-graph limit. Finally, to develop intuition about the graphon GL functional, we compute the GL minimizer for several example families of graphons.</description>

      <title>On norm derivatives and the ball-covering property of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a local version of the ball-covering problem in Banach spaces, and obtain a complete solution to it in terms of the norm derivatives. We illustrate the advantage of the local approach by obtaining substantial refinements of several previously known results on this topic.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality and smoothness induced by the norm derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the concepts of orthogonality and smoothness in normed linear spaces, induced by the derivatives of the norm function. We obtain analytic characterizations of the said orthogonality relations in terms of support functionals in the dual space. We also characterize the related notions of local smoothness and establish its connection with the corresponding orthogonality set, which is analogous to the well-known relation between the Birkhoff-James orthogonality and the classical notion of smoothness. The similarities and the differences between the various notions of smoothness are illustrated by considering some particular examples, including $ \mathbb{K}(\mathbb{H}), $ the Banach space of all compact operators on a Hilbert space $ \mathbb{H}. $</description>

      <title>Hypercyclic subspaces for sequences of finite order differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is proved that, if $(P_n)$ is a sequence of polynomials with complex coefficients having unbounded valences and tending to infinity at sufficiently many points, then there is an infinite dimensional closed subspace of entire functions, as well a dense $\mathfrak{c}$-dimensional subspace of entire functions, all of whose nonzero members are hypercyclic for the corresponding sequence $(P_n(D))$ of differential operators. In both cases, the subspace can be chosen so as to contain any prescribed hypercylic function.</description>

      <title>Operators commuting with complex symmetric weighted composition operators on $H^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we initially study when an anti-linear Toeplitz operator is in the commutant of a composition operator. Primarily, we investigate weighted composition operators $W_{g,\psi}$ commuting with complex symmetric weighted composition operators $W_{f,\varphi}$ on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$. In particular, we give the descriptions of the symbols $g$ and $\psi$ such that the inducing weighted composition operator $W_{g,\psi}$ commutes with the complex symmetric weighted composition operator $W_{f,\varphi}$ with the conjugation $\mathcal{J}$. Furthermore, we subsequently demonstrate that these weighted composition operators are normal and complex symmetric in accordance with the properties of the fixed point of the associated symbol $\varphi$.</description>

      <title>Transference of measures via disintegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact space $K$ and a Banach space $E$ we study the structure of positive measures on the product space $K\times B_{E^*}$ representing functionals on $C(K,E)$, the space of $E$-valued continuous functions on $K$. Using the technique of disintegration we provide an alternative approach to the procedure of transference of measures introduced by Batty (1990). This enables us to substantially strengthen some of his results, to discover a rich order structure on these measures, to identify maximal and minimal elements and to relate them to the classical Choquet order.</description>

      <title>The Surface Signature and Rough Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallel transport, or path development, provides a rich characterization of paths which preserves the underlying algebraic structure of concatenation. The path signature is universal among such maps: any (translation-invariant) parallel transport factors uniquely through the path signature. Furthermore, the path signature is a central object in the theory of rough paths, which provides an integration theory for highly irregular paths. A fundamental result is Lyons' extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough paths, and in turn provides a way to compute parallel transport of arbitrarily irregular paths. In this article, we consider the notion of surface holonomy, a generalization of parallel transport to the higher dimensional setting of surfaces parametrized by rectangular domains, which preserves the higher algebraic structures of horizontal and vertical concatenation. Building on work of Kapranov, we introduce the surface signature, which is universal among surface holonomy maps with respect to continuous 2-connections. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a rough surface and prove a surface extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough surfaces. By exploiting the universal property of the surface signature, this provides a method to compute the surface holonomy of arbitrarily irregular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Fractional maximal operators on weighted variable Lebesgue spaces over the spaces of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,d,\mu)$ is a space of homogeneous type, we establish a new class of fractional-type variable weights $A_{p(\cdot), q(\cdot)}(X)$. Then, we get the new weighted strong-type and weak-type characterizations for fractional maximal operators $M_\eta$ on weighted variable Lebesgue spaces over $(X,d,\mu)$. This study generalizes the results by Cruz-Uribe-Fiorenza-Neugebauer (2012), Bernardis-Dalmasso-Pradolini (2014), Cruz-Uribe-Shukla (2018), and Cruz-Uribe-Cummings (2022).</description>

      <title>The Weighted $L^p$ Minkowski Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem in convex geometry concerns showing a given Borel measure on the unit sphere is, up to perhaps a constant, some type of surface area measure of a convex body. Two types of Minkowski problems in particular are an active area of research: $L^p$ Minkowski problems, introduced by Lutwak and (Lutwak,Yang, and Zhang), and weighted Minkowski problems, introduced by Livshyts. For the latter, the Gaussian Minkowski problem, whose primary investigators were (Huang, Xi and Zhao), is the most prevalent. In this work, we consider weighted surface area in the $L^p$ setting. We propose a framework going beyond the Gaussian setting by focusing on rotational invariant measures, mirroring the recent development of the Gardner-Zvavitch inequality for rotational invariant, log-concave measures. Our results include existence for all $p \in \mathbb R$ (with symmetry assumptions in certain instances). We also have uniqueness for $p \geq 1$ under a concavity assumption. Finally, we obtain results in the so-called $small$ $mass$ $regime$ using degree theory, as instigated in the Gaussian case by (Huang, Xi and Zhao). Most known results for the Gaussian Minkowski problem are then special cases of our main theorems.</description>
