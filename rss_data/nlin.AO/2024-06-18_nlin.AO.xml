      <title>A dynamical system model of gentrification: Exploring a simple rent control strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to understand the factors driving gentrification, we introduce and analyze two simple dynamical systems that model the interplay between three potential drivers of the phenomenon. The constructed systems are based on the assumption that three canonical drivers exist: a subpopulation that increases the desirability of a neighborhood, the desirability of a neighborhood, and the average price of real estate in a neighborhood. The second model modifies the first and implements a simple rent control scheme. For both models, we investigate the linear stability of equilibria and numerically determine the characteristics of oscillatory solutions as a function of system parameters. Introducing a rent control scheme stabilizes the system, in the sense that the parameter regime under which solutions approach equilibrium is expanded. However, oscillatory time series generated by the rent control model are generally more disorganized than those generated by the non-rent control model; in fact, long-term transient chaos was observed under certain conditions in the rent control case. Our results illustrate that even simple models of urban gentrification can lead to complex temporal behavior.</description>

      <title>Vegetation clustering and self-organization in inhomogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to climatic changes, excessive grazing, and deforestation, semi-arid and arid ecosystems are vulnerable to desertification and land degradation. Adversely affected biological productivity has a negative impact on social, economic, and environmental factors. The term 'arid ecosystems' refers not only to water-scarce landscapes but also to nutrient-poor environments. Specifically, the vegetation cover loses spatial homogeneity as aridity increases, and the self-organized heterogeneous vegetation patterns developed could eventually collapse into a bare state. It is still unclear whether this transition would be gradual or abrupt, leading to the often-called catastrophic shift of ecosystems. Several studies suggest that environmental inhomogeneities in time or space can promote a gradual transition to bare soil, thus avoiding catastrophic shifts. Environmental inhomogeneities include non-uniformities in the spatial distribution of precipitation, spatial irregularities in topography and other external factors. Employing a generic mathematical model including environmental inhomogeneities in space, we show how two branches of vegetation patterns create a hysteresis loop when the effective mortality level changes. These two branches correspond to qualitatively distinct vegetation self-organized responses. In an increasing mortality scenario, one observes an equilibrium branch of high vegetation biomass forming self-organized patterns with a well-defined wavelength. However, reversing the mortality trend, one observes a low biomass branch lacking a wavelength. We call this phenomenon the clustering of vegetation patches. This behavior can be connected to historically significant trends of climate change in arid ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto model subject to subsystem resetting: How resetting a part of the system may synchronize the whole of it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate the effects of a new class of stochastic resetting protocol called subsystem resetting, whereby a subset of the system constituents in a many-body interacting system undergoes bare evolution interspersed with simultaneous resets at random times, while the remaining constituents evolve solely under the bare dynamics. We pursue our investigation within the ambit of the well-known Kuramoto model of coupled phase-only oscillators of distributed natural frequencies. Here, the reset protocol corresponds to a chosen set of oscillators being reset to a synchronized state at random times. We find that the mean $\omega_0$ of the natural frequencies plays a defining role in determining the long-time state of the system. For $\omega_0=0$, the system reaches a synchronized stationary state at long times, characterized by a time-independent non-zero value of the synchronization order parameter. Moreover, we find that resetting even an infinitesimal fraction of the total number of oscillators has the drastic effect of synchronizing the entire system, even when the bare evolution does not support synchrony. By contrast, for $\omega_0 \ne 0$, the dynamics allows at long times either a synchronized stationary state or an oscillatory synchronized state, with the latter characterized by an oscillatory behavior as a function of time of the order parameter, with a non-zero time-independent time average. Our results thus imply that the non-reset subsystem always gets synchronized at long times through the act of resetting of the reset subsystem. Our results, analytical using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz as well as those based on numerical simulations, are obtained for two representative oscillator frequency distributions, namely, a Lorentzian and a Gaussian. We discuss how subsystem resetting may be employed as an efficient mechanism to control attainment of global synchrony.</description>
