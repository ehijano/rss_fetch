      <title>Particle Systems and McKean--Vlasov Dynamics with Singular Interaction through Local Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of reflecting Brownian motions on the positive half-line in which each particle has a drift toward the origin determined by the local times at the origin of all the particles. We show that if this local time drift is too strong, such systems can exhibit a breakdown in their solutions in that there is a time beyond which the system cannot be extended. In the finite particle case we give a complete characterization of the finite time breakdown, relying on a novel dynamic graph structure. We consider the mean-field limit of the system in the symmetric case and show that there is a McKean--Vlasov representation. If the drift is too strong, the solution to the corresponding Fokker--Planck equation has a blow up in its solution. We also establish the existence of stationary and self-similar solutions to the McKean--Vlasov equation in the case where there is no breakdown of the system. This work is motivated by models for liquidity in financial markets, the supercooled Stefan problem, and a toy model for cell polarization.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of Pfaffian point process to the Airy line ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of Pfaffian Schur processes whose first coordinate marginal relates to the half--space geometric last passage percolation. We show that the line ensembles corresponding to the Pfaffian Schur processes with geometric weights converge uniformly over compact sets to the Airy line ensemble. By detailed asymptotic analysis of the kernels, we can verify the conditions for the finite dimensional weak convergence introduced in arXiv:2408.08445. By utilizing the tightness criteria of the line ensembles established in arXiv:2410.23899, we can further improve the finite dimensional convergence to the uniform convergence over compact sets. Moreover, using the same methodology we also show that sequences of spiked Pfaffian Schur processes converge uniformly over compact sets to the Airy wanderer line ensembles constructed in arXiv:2408.08445.</description>

      <title>Mobility Edge for the Anderson Model on the Bethe Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pinpoint the spectral decomposition for the Anderson tight-binding model with an unbounded random potential on the Bethe lattice of sufficiently large degree. We prove that there exist a finite number of mobility edges separating intervals of pure-point spectrum from intervals of absolutely continuous spectrum, confirming a prediction of Abou-Chacra, Thouless, and Anderson. A central component of our proof is a monotonicity result for the leading eigenvalue of a certain transfer operator, which governs the decay rate of fractional moments for the tight-binding model's off-diagonal resolvent entries.</description>

      <title>Multiple SLE$_\kappa$ from CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa \in (4,8)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define multichordal CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa \in (4,8)$ as the conditional law of the remainder of a partially explored CLE$_\kappa$. The strands of a multichordal CLE$_\kappa$ have a random link pattern, and their law conditionally on the linking pattern is a (global) multichordal SLE$_\kappa$. The multichordal CLE$_\kappa$ are the conjectural scaling limits of FK and loop $O(n)$ models with some wiring patterns of the boundary arcs.
  We also explain how CLE$_\kappa$ configurations can be locally resampled, and show that the partially explored strands can be relinked in any possible way with positive probability. We will also establish several other estimates for partially explored CLE$_\kappa$. Altogether, these relationships and results serve to provide a toolbox for studying CLE$_\kappa$ and global multiple SLE$_\kappa$.</description>

      <title>"All-Something-Nothing" Phase Transitions in Planted k-Factor Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of inferring a $k$-factor, specifically a spanning $k$-regular graph, planted within an Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,\lambda/n)$. We uncover an interesting "all-something-nothing" phase transition. Specifically, we show that as the average degree $\lambda$ surpasses the critical threshold of $1/k$, the inference problem undergoes a transition from almost exact recovery ("all" phase) to partial recovery ("something" phase). Moreover, as $\lambda$ tends to infinity, the accuracy of recovery diminishes to zero, leading to the onset of the "nothing" phase. This finding complements the recent result by Mossel, Niles-Weed, Sohn, Sun, and Zadik who established that for certain sufficiently dense graphs, the problem undergoes an "all-or-nothing" phase transition, jumping from near-perfect to near-zero recovery. In addition, we characterize the recovery accuracy of a linear-time iterative pruning algorithm and show that it achieves almost exact recovery when $\lambda &lt; 1/k$. A key component of our analysis is a two-step cycle construction: we first build trees through local neighborhood exploration and then connect them by sprinkling using reserved edges. Interestingly, for proving impossibility of almost exact recovery, we construct $\Theta(n)$ many small trees of size $\Theta(1)$, whereas for establishing the algorithmic lower bound, a single large tree of size $\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n})$ suffices.</description>

      <title>A Fourier approach to Levine's hat puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Lionel Levine's notorious hat puzzle with two players. Each player has a stack of hats on their head, and each hat is chosen independently to be either black or white. After observing only the other player's hats, players simultaneously choose one of their own hats. The players win if both chosen hats are black. In this note, we observe an upper bound on the probability of success, using Chang's lemma, a result in Boolean harmonic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes present an alternative approach to the asymptotic stability of stochastic partial differential equations driven by multiplicative noise, applicable to a wide range of dissipative systems. The method builds on general criteria established in \cite{GLLL2024b,L2023}, utilizing the eventual continuity and generalized coupling techniques.</description>

      <title>One-point large deviations of the directed landscape geodesic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directed landscape, the central object in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, is shown to be the scaling limit of various models by Dauvergne and Vir\'ag (2022) and Dauvergne, Ortmann and Vir\'ag (2018). In his study of geodesics in upper tail deviations of the directed landscape, Liu (2022) put forward a conjecture about the rate of the lowest rate metric under which a geodesic between two points passes through a particular point between them. Das, Dauvergne and Vir\'ag (2024) disproved his conjecture, and made a conjecture of their own. This paper disproves that conjecture and puts the question to rest with an answer and a proof.</description>

      <title>Thorin processes and their subordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Thorin process is a stochastic process with independent and stationary increments whose time marginal laws are weak limits of finite convolutions of gamma distributions. Many popular L\'evy processes fall under this class. Thorin processes can be characterized by a representing Thorin triplet that conveys more information on the process properties compared to the L\'evy triplet. In this paper we investigate some relationships between the Thorin structure and the process, and find that the support of the Thorin measure characterizes the existence of the critical exponential moment, as well as the asymptotic equivalence between the L\'evy tail function and the complementary distribution function. Furthermore, Brownian subordination with respect to Thorin subordinators produces Thorin processes whose representing measure is given by a pushforward with respect to a hyperbolic function, leading to arguably easier formulae compared to the Bochner integral determining the L\'evy measure. We provide a full account of the theory of multivariate Thorin processes, starting from the Thorin-Bondesson representation for the characteristic function, and highlight the roles of the Thorin measure in the analysis of density functions, moments, path variation and subordination. Various old and new examples of Thorin processes are discussed. We finally detail a treatment of subordination of gamma processes with respect to negative binomial subordinators which is made possible by the Thorin-Bondesson representation.</description>

      <title>Star decompositions and independent sets in random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $k$-star decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into $k$-stars (i.e., $k$ edges with a common vertex). The paper studies the following problem: for what values of $k&gt;d/2$ does the random $d$-regular graph have a $k$-star decomposition (asymptotically almost surely, provided that the number of edges is divisible by $k$)?
  Delcourt, Greenhill, Isaev, Lidick\'y, and Postle proposed the following conjecture. It is easy to see that a $k$-star decomposition necessitates the existence of an independent set of density $1-d/(2k)$. So let $k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$ be the largest $k$ for which the random $d$-regular graph a.a.s.~contains an independent set of this density. Clearly, $k$-star decompositions cannot exist for $k&gt;k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$. The conjecture suggests that this is essentially the only restriction: there is a threshold $k^\star_d$ such that $k$-star decompositions exist if and only if $k \leq k^\star_d$, and it (basically) coincides with the other threshold, i.e., $k^\star_d \approx k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$.
  We confirm this conjecture for sufficiently large $d$ by showing that a $k$-star decomposition exists if $d/2&lt; k &lt; k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$. In fact, we even prove the existence of a $k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$-star decomposition for degrees $d$ with asymptotic density $1$.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation for the stochastic Burgers equation driven by white noise from local measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For one dimensional stochastic Burgers equation driven by space-time white noise we consider the problem of estimation of the diffusivity parameter in front of the second-order spatial derivative. Based on local observations in space, we study the estimator derived in [Altmeyer, Rei{\ss}, Ann. Appl. Probab.(2021)] for linear stochastic heat equation that has also been used in [Altmeyer, Cialenco, Pasemann, Bernoulli (2023)] to cover large class of semilinear SPDEs and has been examined for the stochastic Burgers equation driven by trace class noise. We extend the achieved results by considering the space-time white noise case which has also relevant physical motivations. After we establish new regularity results for the solution, we are able to show that our proposed estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.11380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove universality of a macroscopic behavior of solutions of a large class of semi-linear parabolic SPDEs on $\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{T}$ with fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}$, additive noise and polynomial non-linearity, where $\mathbb{T}$ is the $d$-dimensional torus. We consider the weakly non-linear regime and not necessarily Gaussian noises which are stationary, centered, sufficiently regular and satisfy some integrability and mixing conditions. We prove that the macroscopic scaling limit exists and has a universal law characterized by parameters of the relevant perturbations of the linear equation. We develop a new solution theory for singular SPDEs of the above-mentioned form using the Wilsonian renormalization group theory and the Polchinski flow equation. In particular, in the case of $d=4$ and the cubic non-linearity our analysis covers the whole sub-critical regime $\sigma&gt;2$. Our technique avoids completely all the algebraic and combinatorial problems arising in different approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competing and Complementary risk (CCR) problems are often modelled using a class of distributions of the maximum, or minimum, of a random number of i.i.d. random variables; we call this class the CCR class of distributions. While the CCR distributions generally do not have an easy-to-calculate density or probability mass function, two special cases, namely the Poisson-exponential and the exponential geometric distributions, can easily be calculated. Hence, it is of interest to approximate CCR distributions with these simpler distributions. In this paper, we develop Stein's method for the CCR class of distributions to provide a general comparison approach to bound the distance between two CCR distributions and contrast this approach to bounds obtained using a Lindeberg argument. We detail the comparison for Poisson-exponential and exponential-geometric distributions.</description>

      <title>On the tradeoff between almost sure error tolerance and mean deviation frequency in martingale convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09055v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we quantify almost sure martingale convergence theorems in terms of the tradeoff between asymptotic almost sure rates of convergence (error tolerance) and the respective modulus of convergence. For this purpose we generalize {an} elementary quantitative version of the first Borel-Cantelli lemma on the statistics of the deviation frequencies (error incidence), which was recently established by the authors. First we study martingale convergence in $L^2$, and in the setting of the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality. In a second step we study the strong law of large numbers for martingale differences in two settings: uniformly bounded increments in $L^p$, $p\geq 2$, using the respective Baum-Katz-Stoica theorems, and uniformly bounded exponential moments with the help of the martingale estimates by Lesigne and Voln\'y. We also present applications for the tradeoff for the multicolor generalized P\'olya urn process, the Generalized Chinese restaurant process, statistical M-estimators, as well as the a.s.~excursion frequencies of the Galton-Watson branching process. Finally, we relate the tradeoff concept to the convergence in the Ky Fan metric.</description>

      <title>Stationary Measure of the Open KPZ Equation through the Enaud-Derrida Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works of Barraquand and Le Doussal and Bryc, Kuznetsov, Wang, and Wesolowski gave a description of the open KPZ stationary measure as the sum of a Brownian motion and a Brownian motion reweighted by a Radon-Nikodym derivative. Subsequent work of Barraquand and Le Doussal used the Enaud-Derrida representation of the DEHP algebra to formulate the open ASEP stationary measure in terms of the sum of a random walk and a random walk reweighted by a Radon-Nikodym derivative. They show that this Radon-Nikodym derivative converges pointwise to the Radon-Nikodym derivative that characterizes the open KPZ stationary measure. This article proves that the corresponding sequence of measures converges weakly to the open KPZ stationary measure. This provides an alternative proof of the probabilistic formulation of the open KPZ stationary measure, which avoids dealing explicitly with finite dimensional distributions. We also provide the first construction of the measure on intervals of a general length and for the full range of parameters in the fan region $(u+v&gt;0)$.</description>

      <title>The Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem for SPDEs in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a unified proof of the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem for various notions of solutions for SPDEs in Banach spaces with cylindrical Wiener noise. We use Kurtz' generalization of the theorems of Yamada, Watanabe and Engelbert. In addition, we deduce the classical Yamada-Watanabe theorem for SPDEs, with a slightly different notion of `unique strong solution' than that corresponding to the result of Kurtz. Our setting includes analytically strong solutions, analytically weak solutions and mild solutions. Moreover, our approach offers flexibility with regard to the function spaces and integrability conditions that are chosen in the solution notion (and affect the meaning of existence and uniqueness). All results hold in Banach spaces which are either martingale type 2 or UMD. For analytically weak solutions, the results hold in arbitrary Banach spaces. In particular, our results extend the Yamada-Watanabe theorems of Ondrej\'at for mild solutions in 2-smooth Banach spaces, of R\"ockner et al. for the variational framework and of Kunze for analytically weak solutions, and cover many new settings. As a tool, and of interest itself, we construct a measurable representation $I$ of the stochastic integral in a martingale type 2 or UMD Banach space, in the sense that for any stochastically integrable process $f$ and cylindrical Brownian motion $W$, we have $I(f(\omega),W(\omega),\mathrm{Law}(f,W)) = (\int_0^{\cdot} f\, \mathrm{d}W)(\omega)$ for almost every $\omega$.</description>

      <title>The largest subcritical component in inhomogeneous random graphs of preferential attachment type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the size of the largest connected component in a subcritical inhomogeneous random graph with a kernel of preferential attachment type. The component is polynomial in the graph size with an explicitly given exponent, which is strictly larger than the exponent for the largest degree in the graph. This is in stark contrast to the behaviour of inhomogeneous random graphs with a kernel of rank one. Our proof uses local approximation by branching random walks going well beyond the weak local limit and novel results on subcritical killed branching random walks.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for semilinear partial integro-differential equations and its complexity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09639v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for semilinear parabolic partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). We prove that the numerical approximation scheme converges to the unique viscosity solution of the PIDE under consideration. To that end, we derive a Feynman-Kac representation for the unique viscosity solution of the semilinear PIDE, extending the classical Feynman-Kac representation for linear PIDEs. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. the computational complexity of the algorithm is bounded polynomially in the dimension $d$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. We also provide a numerical example in up to 10'000 dimensions to demonstrate its applicability.</description>

      <title>State-space systems as dynamic generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic framework to study the dependence structure induced by deterministic discrete-time state-space systems between input and output processes is introduced. General sufficient conditions are formulated under which output processes exist and are unique once an input process has been fixed, a property that in the deterministic state-space literature is known as the echo state property. When those conditions are satisfied, the given state-space system becomes a generative model for probabilistic dependences between two sequence spaces. Moreover, those conditions guarantee that the output depends continuously on the input when using the Wasserstein metric. The output processes whose existence is proved are shown to be causal in a specific sense and to generalize those studied in purely deterministic situations. The results in this paper constitute a significant stochastic generalization of sufficient conditions for the deterministic echo state property to hold, in the sense that the stochastic echo state property can be satisfied under contractivity conditions that are strictly weaker than those in deterministic situations. This means that state-space systems can induce a purely probabilistic dependence structure between input and output sequence spaces even when there is no functional relation between those two spaces.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a multi-target linear shrinkage covariance estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-target linear shrinkage is an extension of the standard single-target linear shrinkage for covariance estimation. We combine several constant matrices - the targets - with the sample covariance matrix. We derive the oracle and a \textit{bona fide} multi-target linear shrinkage estimator with exact and empirical mean. In both settings, we proved its convergence towards the oracle under Kolmogorov asymptotics. Finally, we show empirically that it outperforms other standard estimators in various situations.</description>

      <title>Parallel Backpropagation for Inverse of a Convolution with Application to Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse of Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use the Inverse of Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm to optimize the inverse of the convolution layer, resulting in fast training times. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</description>

      <title>The Uniformly Rotated Mondrian Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random feature maps are used to decrease the computational cost of kernel machines in large-scale problems. The Mondrian kernel is one such example of a fast random feature approximation of the Laplace kernel, generated by a computationally efficient hierarchical random partition of the input space known as the Mondrian process. In this work, we study a variation of this random feature map by applying a uniform random rotation to the input space before running the Mondrian process to approximate a kernel that is invariant under rotations. We obtain a closed-form expression for the isotropic kernel that is approximated, as well as a uniform convergence rate of the uniformly rotated Mondrian kernel to this limit. To this end, we utilize techniques from the theory of stationary random tessellations in stochastic geometry and prove a new result on the geometry of the typical cell of the superposition of uniformly rotated Mondrian tessellations. Finally, we test the empirical performance of this random feature map on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its improved performance over the Mondrian kernel on a dataset that is debiased from the standard coordinate axes.</description>
