      <title>Enhanced Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Ultrasound Propagation in Transit-Time Flow Meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate a time and memory efficient application of Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods for the simulation of the ultrasounds advection in moving fluids. In particular, this study addresses to the analysis of transit-time ultrasonic meters which rely on the propagation of acoustic waves to measure fluids flow rate. Accurate and efficient simulations of the physics related to the transport of ultrasounds are therefore crucial for studying and enhancing these devices. Starting from the description of the linearized Euler equations (LEE) model and presenting the general theory of explicit-time DG methods for hyperbolic systems, we then motivate the use of a spectral basis and introduce a novel high-accuracy method for the imposition of absorbing and resistive walls which analyses the incident wave direction across the boundary surface. The proposed implementation is both accurate and efficient, making it suitable for industrial applications of acoustic wave propagation.</description>

      <title>NoX: a Compact Open-Source RISC-V Processor for Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IoT applications are one of the driving forces in making systems energy and power-efficient, given their resource constraints. However, because of security, latency, and transmission, we advocate for local computing through multi-processor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) for edge computing. The RISC-V ISA has grown in academia and industry due to its flexibility. Still, available open-source cores cannot be seamlessly integrated into MPSoCs for a fast time to market. This paper presents NoX, a compact open-source plug-and-play 32-bit RISC-V core designed in System Verilog for efficient data processing in MPSoCs. NoX has a 4-stage single-issue in-order pipeline with full bypass, providing an efficient resource-constrained architecture. Compared to industry and academia resource-constrained RISC-V cores, NoX offers a better resource usage and performance trade-off.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Based Reduced-Order Models for Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the construction of non-intrusive Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) for plasma turbulence simulations. In particular, we propose using Operator Inference (OpInf) to build low-cost physics-based ROMs from data for such simulations. As a representative example, we focus on the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations used for modeling two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence. For a comprehensive perspective of the potential of OpInf to construct accurate ROMs, we consider three setups for the HW equations by varying a key model parameter, namely the adiabaticity coefficient. These setups lead to the formation of complex and nonlinear dynamics, which makes the construction of accurate ROMs of any kind challenging. We generate the training datasets by performing direct numerical simulations of the HW equations and recording the computed state data and outputs the over a time horizon of 100 time units in the turbulent phase. We then use these datasets to construct OpInf ROMs for predictions over 400 additional time units. Our results show that the OpInf ROMs capture the important features of the turbulent dynamics and generalize beyond the training time horizon while reducing the computational effort of the high-fidelity simulation by up to five orders of magnitude. In the broader context of fusion research, this shows that non-intrusive SciML ROMs have the potential to drastically accelerate numerical studies, which can ultimately enable tasks such as the design of optimized fusion devices.</description>
