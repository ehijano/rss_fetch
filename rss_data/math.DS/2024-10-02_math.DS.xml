      <title>Rate-induced biosphere collapse in the Daisyworld model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is much interest in the phenomenon of rate-induced tipping, where a system changes abruptly when forcings change faster than some critical rate. Here, we demonstrate and analyse rate-induced tipping in the classic "Daisyworld" model. The Daisyworld model considers a hypothetical planet inhabited only by two species of daisies with different reflectivities, and is notable because the daisies lead to an emergent "regulation" of the planet's temperature. The model serves as a useful thought experiment regarding the co-evolution of life and the global environment, and has been widely used in the teaching of Earth system science.
  We show that sufficiently fast changes in insolation (i.e. incoming sunlight) can cause life on Daisyworld to go extinct, even if life could in principle survive at any fixed insolation value among those encountered. Mathematically, this occurs due to the fact that the solution of the forced (nonautonomous) system crosses the stable manifold of a saddle point for the frozen (autonomous) system. The new discovery of rate-induced tipping in such a classic, simple, and well-studied model provides further supporting evidence that rate-induced tipping -- and indeed, rate-induced collapse -- may be common in a wide range of systems.</description>

      <title>Non-leading eigenvalues of the Perron-Frobenius operators for beta-maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Perron-Frobenius operator defined on the space of functions of bounded variation for the beta-map $\tau_\beta(x)=\beta x$ (mod $1$), for $\beta\in(1,\infty)$, and investigate its isolated eigenvalues except $1$, called non-leading eigenvalues in this paper. We show that the set of $\beta$'s such that the corresponding Perron-Frobenius operator has at least one non-leading eigenvalue is open and dense in $(1,\infty)$. Furthermore, we establish the H\"older continuity of each non-leading eigenvalue as a function of $\beta$ and show in particular that it is continuous but non-differentiable, whose analogue was conjectured by Flatto et.al. in \cite{Fl-La-Po}. In addition, for an eigenfunctional of the Perron-Frobenius operator corresponding to an isolated eigenvalue, we give an explicit formula for the value of the functional applied to the indicator function of every interval. As its application, we provide three results related to non-leading eigenvalues, one of which states that an eigenfunctional corresponding to a non-leading eigenvalue can not be expressed by any complex measure on the interval, which is contrast to the case of the leading eigenvalue $1$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce distinct definitions of local stable/unstable sets for flows without fixed points, namely, kinematic, geometric, and sectionally geometric, and discuss relations between them. We prove the existence of continua with a uniform diameter within each sectionally geometric local stable/unstable set for cw-expansive flows defined on Peano continua.</description>

      <title>An Extended Admittance Modeling Method with Synchronization Node for Stability Assessment of Converters-Interlinked System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse synchronization dynamics within the grid-following (GFL)/grid-forming (GFM) converters-interlinked system are prone to induce oscillatory instabilities. To quantify their stability influences, frequency-domain modal analysis (FMA) method based on the impedance network can serve as a good reference. However, since the adopted impedance network only retains electrical nodes, oscillation information provided by the FMA method is mainly concerned with circuits (e.g., participation of nodes), which is not convenient for an intuitive probe of sync loops' participations. To address this issue, this paper proposes an extended admittance modeling method for FMA, the basis of which is the explicit characterization of GFL/GFM sync loops. First, a four-port extended impedance model (EIM) of converter with one virtual sync node is proposed. Its resulting extended impedance network (EIN) is formed for the converters-interlinked system. Then, the FMA method can be directly applied to those virtual sync nodes/branches, so as to realize an intuitive evaluation of sync dynamics' effects on oscillations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by the frequency scanning and time domain simulations in a typical point-to-point HVDC system.</description>

      <title>Practical identification approach for the actuation dynamics of autonomous surface vehicles with minimal instrumentation: extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A practical method for identifying the propeller model and inertia matrix of a marine Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) is proposed in this work. Special attention is paid to limiting the instrumentation requirements. In particular, an input gain considering the conditioning interface of the propellers input signals is estimated using only the measurements of the position and heading of the vessel and the pulse width modulation (PWM) signals of the propellers. This scheme eliminates the need for acceleration measurements. Using either second-order static or first-order dynamic models, the proposed approach not only provides insights into propeller behaviour but also into vessel inertia characteristics, which aids in the development of automated navigation and control systems. Model validation was performed using experimental data from a catamaran-shaped ASV. Precise metrics are used to evaluate and compare model prediction errors related to both linear velocities and yaw rate. The results underscore the robustness and accuracy of the identified models in capturing the essential dynamics of the autonomous surface vehicle, with a determination coefficient that consistently exceeds 0.94 for all estimated velocities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a result of Lopes and Thieullen on sub-actions for smooth Anosov flows to the setting of geodesic flow on locally CAT(-1) spaces. This allows us to use arguments originally due to Croke and Dairbekov to prove a volume rigidity theorem for some interesting locally CAT(-1) spaces, including quotients of Fuchsian buildings and surface amalgams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global rigidity results for actions of higher rank lattices on nilmanifolds containing a partially hyperbolic element. We consider actions of higher rank lattices on tori or on $2-$step nilpotent nilmanifolds, such that the actions contain a partially hyperbolic element with $1-$dimensional center. In this setting we prove, under a technical assumption on the partially hyperbolic element, that any such action must be by affine maps. This extends results by Brown, Rodriguez Hertz, and Wang to certain lattice actions that are not Anosov.</description>

      <title>Fast-and-flexible decision-making with modulatory interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems in biology, society, and engineering are capable of making decisions through the dynamic interaction of their elements. Nonlinearity of the interactions is key for the speed, robustness, and flexibility of multi-agent decision-making. In this work we introduce modulatory, that is, multiplicative, in contrast to additive, interactions in a nonlinear opinion dynamics model of fast-and-flexible decision-making. The original model is nonlinear because network interactions, although additive, are saturated. Modulatory interactions introduce an extra source of nonlinearity that greatly enriches the model decision-making behavior in a mathematically tractable way. Modulatory interactions are widespread in both biological and social decision-making networks; our model provides new tools to understand the role of these interactions in networked decision-making and to engineer them in artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Hybridized Projected Differential Transform Method For collisional-breakage equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-linear collision induced fragmentation plays a crucial role in modeling several engineering and physical problems. In contrast to linear breakage, it has not been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. This study introduces an innovative method that leverages the Elzaki integral transform as a preparatory step to enhance the accuracy and convergence of domain decomposition, used alongside the projected differential transform method to obtain closed-form or series approximations of solutions for the collisional breakage equation (CBE). A significant advantages of this technique is its capability to directly address both linear and nonlinear differential equations without the need for discretization or linearization. The mathematical framework is reinforced by a thorough convergence analysis, applying fixed point theory within an adequately defined Banach space. Additionally, error estimates for the approximated solutions are derived, offering more profound insights into the accuracy and dependability of the proposed method. The validity of this approach is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with exact or finite volume approximated solutions considering several physical examples. Interestingly, the proposed algorithm yields accurate approximations for the number density functions as well as moments with fewer terms and maintains higher precision over extended time periods.</description>

      <title>Koopman Operator in the Weighted Function Spaces and its Learning for the Estimation of Lyapunov and Zubov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mathematical properties and data-driven learning of the Koopman operator, which represents nonlinear dynamics as a linear mapping on a properly defined functional spaces, have become key problems in nonlinear system identification and control. However, Koopman operators that are approximately learned from snapshot data may not always accurately predict the system evolution on long horizons. In this work, by defining the Koopman operator on a space of weighted continuous functions and learning it on a weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the Koopman operator is guaranteed to be contractive and the accumulation learning error is bounded. The weighting function, assumed to be known a priori, has an exponential decay with the flow or decays exponentially when compensated by an exponential factor. Under such a construction, the Koopman operator learned from data is used to estimate (i) Lyapunov functions for globally asymptotically stable dynamics, and (ii) Zubov-Lyapunov functions that characterize the domain of attraction. For these estimations, probabilistic bounds on the errors are derived.</description>

      <title>Tipping mechanisms in a carbon cycle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs when a ramp parameter changes rapidly enough to cause the system to tip between co-existing, attracting states, while noise-induced tipping (N-tipping) occurs when there are random transitions between two attractors of the underlying deterministic system. This work investigates R-tipping and N-tipping events in a carbonate system in the upper ocean, in which the key objective is understanding how the system undergoes tipping away from a stable fixed point in a bistable regime. While R-tipping away from the fixed point is straightforward, N-tipping poses challenges due to a periodic orbit forming the basin boundary for the attracting fixed point of the underlying deterministic system. Furthermore, in the case of N-tipping, we are interested in the case where noise is away from the small noise limit, as it is more appropriate for the application. We compute the most probable escape path (MPEP) for our system, resulting in a firm grasp on the least action path in an asymmetric system of higher scale. Our analysis shows that the carbon cycle model is susceptible to both tipping mechanisms when using the standard formulations.</description>

      <title>Attractors for weak and strong solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the existence of global attractors for the dynamical systems generated by weak solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with damping. We consider two cases, depending on the values of the parameters \b{eta},{\alpha} controlling the damping term and the viscosity {\mu}. First, for \b{eta} we define a multivalued dynamical systems and prove the existence of the global attractor as well. Second, for either \b{eta}&gt;3 or \b{eta}=3, 4{\alpha}{\mu}&gt;1 the weak solutions are unique and we prove that the global attractor for the corresponding semigroup is more regular. Also, we prove in this case that it is the global attractor for the semigroup generated by the strong solutions. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyapunov functions with exponential weights have been used successfully as a powerful tool for the stability analysis of hyperbolic systems of balance laws. In this paper we extend the class of weight functions to a family of hyperbolic functions and study the advantages in the analysis of $2\times 2$ systems of balance laws. We present cases connected with the study of the limit of stabilizability where the new weights provide Lyapunov functions that show exponential stability for a larger set of problem parameters than classical exponential weights.
  Moreover, we show that sufficiently large time-delays influence the limit of stabilizability in the sense that the parameter set where the system can be stabilized becomes substantially smaller.
  We also demonstrate that the hyperbolic weights are useful in the analysis of the boundary feedback stability of systems of balance laws that are governed by quasilinear hyperbolic partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Koopman Spectral Analysis from Noisy Measurements based on Bayesian Learning and Kalman Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman spectral analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems as it reveals key system behaviors and long-term dynamics. However, the presence of measurement noise poses a significant challenge to accurately extracting spectral properties. In this work, we propose a robust method for identifying the Koopman operator and extracting its spectral characteristics in noisy environments. To address the impact of noise, our approach tackles an identification problem that accounts for both systematic errors from finite-dimensional approximations and measurement noise in the data. By incorporating Bayesian learning and Kalman smoothing, the method simultaneously identifies the Koopman operator and estimates system states, effectively decoupling these two error sources. The method's efficiency and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments, showcasing its accuracy across varying noise levels.</description>

      <title>The proportion of $k$-cycles for polynomials modulo primes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f(x) \in \mathbb{F}_p[x]$, and define the orbit of $x\in \mathbb{F}_p$ under the iteration of $f$ to be the set \[ \mathcal{O}(x):=\{x,f(x),(f\circ f)(x),(f\circ f\circ f)(x),\dots\}. \] An orbit is a $k$-cycle if it is periodic of length $k$. In this paper we fix a polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients and for each prime $p$ we consider $f(x) \pmod p$ obtained by reducing the coefficients of $f(x)$ modulo $p$. We ask for the density of primes $p$ such that $f(x)\pmod p$ has a $k$-cycle in $\mathbb{F}_p$. We prove that in many cases the density is at most $1/k$. We also give an infinite family of polynomials in each degree with this property.</description>

      <title>Internal noise interference to warnings of tipping points in generic multi-dimensional dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A deterministic dynamical system that slowly passes through a generic fold-type (saddle-node) bifurcation can be reduced to one-dimensional dynamics close to the bifurcation because of the centre manifold theorem. It is often tacitly assumed that the same is true in the presence of stochasticity or noise so that, for example, critical slowing down (CSD) indicators can be applied as if the system were one-dimensional. In this work, we show that this is only true when given suitable system observables; specifically, we demonstrate that noise in other dimensions may interfere with indicators of CSD, also referred to as early warning signals (EWS). We point out a generic mechanism by which both variance and lag-1 autocorrelation [AC(1)], as well as other EWS, can fail to signal an approaching bifurcation. This can, in principle, occur whenever one noise source drives multiple system components simultaneously. Even under the favourable assumptions of uncoupled deterministic dynamics and stationary noise, some system observables can then exhibit false negative or false positive CSD indications. We isolate this phenomenon in an example that represents a generic two-dimensional fold-type bifurcation setting.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of renormalization of critical quasicircle maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a well developed renormalization theory of real analytic critical circle maps by de Faria, de Melo, and Yampolsky. In this paper, we extend Yampolsky's result on hyperbolicity of renormalization periodic points to a larger class of dynamical objects, namely critical quasicircle maps, i.e. analytic self homeomorphisms of a quasicircle with a single critical point. Unlike critical circle maps, the inner and outer criticalities of critical quasicircle maps can be distinct. We develop a compact analytic renormalization operator called Corona Renormalization with a hyperbolic fixed point whose stable manifold has codimension one and consists of critical quasicircle maps of the same criticality and periodic type rotation number. Our proof is an adaptation of Pacman Renormalization Theory for Siegel disks as well as rigidity results on the escaping dynamics of transcendental entire functions.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}(n)$ be the maximum number of limit cycles that a planar polynomial vector field of degree $n$ can have. In this paper we prove that $\mathcal{H}(n)$ is realizable by structurally stable vector fields with only hyperbolic limit cycles and that it is a strictly increasing function whenever it is finite.</description>

      <title>Exponential stability of linear periodic difference-delay equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the stability of linear periodic difference delay systems, where the value at time $t$ of a solution is a linear combination with periodic coefficients of its values at finitely many delayed instants $t-\tau_1,\ldots,t-\tau_N$. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for exponential stability of such systems when the coefficients have H\"older-continuous derivative, that generalizes the one obtained for difference delay systems with constant coefficients by Henry and Hale in the 1970s. This condition may be construed as analyticity, in a half plane, of the (operator valued) harmonic transfer function of an associated linear control system.</description>

      <title>Coherent set identification via direct low rank maximum likelihood estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze connections between two low rank modeling approaches from the last decade for treating dynamical data. The first one is the coherence problem (or coherent set approach), where groups of states are sought that evolve under the action of a stochastic transition matrix in a way maximally distinguishable from other groups. The second one is a low rank factorization approach for stochastic matrices, called Direct Bayesian Model Reduction (DBMR), which estimates the low rank factors directly from observed data. We show that DBMR results in a low rank model that is a projection of the full model, and exploit this insight to infer bounds on a quantitative measure of coherence within the reduced model. Both approaches can be formulated as optimization problems, and we also prove a bound between their respective objectives. On a broader scope, this work relates the two classical loss functions of nonnegative matrix factorization, namely the Frobenius norm and the generalized Kullback--Leibler divergence, and suggests new links between likelihood-based and projection-based estimation of probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>MEV Sharing with Dynamic Extraction Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has emerged as a new frontier in the design of blockchain systems. In this paper, we propose making the MEV extraction rate as part of the protocol design space. Our aim is to leverage this parameter to maintain a healthy balance between block producers (who need to be compensated) and users (who need to feel encouraged to transact). We follow the approach introduced by EIP-1559 and design a similar mechanism to dynamically update the MEV extraction rate with the goal of stabilizing it at a target value. We study the properties of this dynamic mechanism and show that, while convergence to the target can be guaranteed for certain parameters, instability, and even chaos, can occur in other cases. Despite these complexities, under general conditions, the system concentrates in a neighborhood of the target equilibrium implying high long-term performance. Our work establishes, the first to our knowledge, dynamic framework for the integral problem of MEV sharing between extractors and users.</description>

      <title>FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fast simulation of dynamical systems is a key challenge in many scientific and engineering applications, such as weather forecasting, disease control, and drug discovery. With the recent success of deep learning, there is increasing interest in using neural networks to solve differential equations in a data-driven manner. However, existing methods are either limited to specific types of differential equations or require large amounts of data for training. This restricts their practicality in many real-world applications, where data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal foundation model, named \textbf{FMint} (\textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel based on \textbf{In}i\textbf{t}ialization), to bridge the gap between human-designed and data-driven models for the fast simulation of dynamical systems. Built on a decoder-only transformer architecture with in-context learning, FMint utilizes both numerical and textual data to learn a universal error correction scheme for dynamical systems, using prompted sequences of coarse solutions from traditional solvers. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 40K ODEs, and we perform extensive experiments on challenging ODEs that exhibit chaotic behavior and of high dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared to classical numerical solvers, highlighting FMint's potential as a general-purpose solver for dynamical systems. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms. The code for FMint is available at \url{https://github.com/margotyjx/FMint}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a new scheme for studying the dynamics of a quintic wave equation with nonlocal weak damping in a 3D smooth bounded domain. As an application, the existence and structure of weak, strong, and exponential attractors for the solution semigroup of this equation are obtained. The investigation sheds light on the well-posedness and long-time behavior of nonlinear dissipative evolution equations with nonlinear damping and critical nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Rotating Wall-Mode Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, Ra ~ 31.8 Ta^(1/2) - 4.43 Ta^(5/12) for no-slip boundaries. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>
