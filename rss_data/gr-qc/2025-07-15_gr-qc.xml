      <title>Observational signatures of scalar field dynamics in modified $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of a tanh-parametrized scalar field model in the framework of modified $f(Q, L_{m})$ gravity by adopting the form $f(Q, L_{m})=\beta Q+\delta L_{m}$ along with a scalar field energy density $\rho_\phi = \rho_{c0} \tanh(A + Bz)$. Using MCMC methods and combining $31$ cosmic chronometer data points, $15$ BAO, DESI DR2 BAO and $1701$ Pantheon+ samples, we constrain the model parameters and obtain $H_{0}=74.284^{+4.155}_{-4.275}$, $\Omega_{m0}=0.326^{+0.093}_{-0.072}$ and $B=-0.001^{+0.030}_{-0.030}$. The model predicts a transition redshift $z_{tr}=0.5914$ and a present deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.5167$, consistent with a Universe transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. We further analyze the evolution of the EoS parameter, density components and statefinder diagnostics in which all parameters show asymptotic convergence to a de Sitter phase. Additionally, we study black hole mass accretion, showing its dependence on the scalar field dynamics. This work highlights the compatibility of tanh-scalar field forms with $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity in describing cosmic acceleration and gravitational phenomena.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Energy Extraction from Kerr Black Holes: Ab-Initio Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism represents a cornerstone of relativistic astrophysics. We present general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres covering a wide range in the black-hole spin. Considering a classical split-monopole magnetic field, we can reproduce with these ab-initio calculations the force-free electrodynamics of rotating black holes and measure the power of the jet launched as a function of the spin. The Blandford-Znajek luminosity we find is in very good agreement with analytic calculations and compatible with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations via a simple rescaling. These results provide strong evidence of the robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and accurate estimates of the electromagnetic luminosity to be expected in those scenarios involving rotating black holes across the mass scale.</description>

      <title>Frozen states of charged boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study frozen states of charged boson stars. These solutions are globally regular and exist in a U(1) gauged scalar field model minimally coupled to gravity for suitable choices of the coupling constants. These configurations are field theoretical realizations of the Mazur-Mottola solution with a de Sitter interior, a black hole exterior and a thin shell that interpolates between the two and replaces the event horizon. We demonstrate that standard electrodynamics is sufficient to find these frozen states, but that the self-interaction of the scalar field is crucial. Adding Horndeski vector-tensor gravity to the model allows the frozen states to exist without self-interaction though. The frozen states possess one stable and one unstable lightring, the former inside the thin shell, the latter in the black hole exterior.</description>

      <title>Topological dressing method for the Einstein-Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regular method is proposed that makes it possible to obtain a new exact solution with a wormhole from any topologically trivial exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations in an electrovacuum (topological dressing method). This solution has a structure similar to that of a thin-shell wormhole, but unlike it, it is exact and, therefore, does not require the presence of any other field sources. The wormhole itself is shown to create both gravitational and electromagnetic fields. The corresponding effective mass and effective charge are distributed over the surface of its throat and around it. The topological dressing of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution with zero effective mass and non-zero effective charge gives a new solution describing a traversable wormhole. This solution is shown to be stable in the presence of external pressure.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Kerr with approximate Killing spinors -- Part 1: Wave version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a new framework for non-linear perturbations of the Kerr spacetime. This is based on a characterization of the Kerr spacetime in terms of a Killing spinor. On the perturbed spacetime, one can construct an approximation of the Killing spinor. Based on this, a number of quantities are constructed measuring the deviation from Kerr. Evolution equations for these quantities are derived. Approximations of the Killing vectors, the mass and angular momentum parameters etc., are constructed along with a full set of equations for their derivatives. In this setting, we don't need a reference background solution. Instead, we covariantly construct the relevant structures on the perturbed spacetime itself. This can eliminate many issues and allow for a cleaner analysis.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive dynamical and phenomenological analysis of structure growth in curvature-modulated coupled quintessence scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa \rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R^2/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa \phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable, non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by $\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast $\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus $\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable approach to interacting dark energy.</description>

      <title>Combining (post-)Newtonian ideas with quasi-equilibrium (QE) sequence analysis for black hole-neutron star (BHNS) gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present quasi equilibrium models of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries with mass and spin values compatible with parameter estimates derived from gravitational radiation events GW200105 and GW200115, events consistent with the merger of BHNSs. Using the FUKA initial data framework, we determine the location of ISCO (Innermost Stable Circular Orbit) and radius of mass shedding. In most of the cases studied here the innermost stable orbit is located at larger separations. This is consistent with the fact that for those two events no electromagnetic counterparts have been observed since it is believed that the NS will enter into the plunge phase in a short time once the separation of the components of the binary will be smaller of ISCO. In analogy with classical binaries, we have associated to these QE sequences a Newtonian and Post Newtonian Roche Lobe analysis to verify whether the NS is filling its Roche Lobe before approaching the ISCO. For selected configurations explored here, the location of ISCO and of the orbit at which mass shedding occurs are at separation smaller than the last converged solution of our sequences. Our analysis shows that in such cases the neutron star is filling its Roche lobe suggesting that mass transfer might occur well before encountering the last stable orbit, and this should happen in catastrophic way in order to prevent any electromagnetic emissions. If this is the case, we are suggestion a third fate of the neutron star beyond the plunge or tidal disruption ones.</description>

      <title>Static Spherically Symmetric Solutions in General Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering an action in F(G) modified gravity, the static spherically symmetric solutions are investigated. Introducing the Lagrangian multipliers {\alpha} we obtain the Lagrangian and equations of motion. we obtain two type solutions for these models. The first case leads to Schwarzschild-de Sitter (anti de Sitter) solution and the other one, results in a new metric. At last, the event horizon, the Hawking temperature and the generalized second law of thermodynamics in the framework of the modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity for this solution as a black hole are investigated.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmological dynamics of scalar-tensor models of dark energy in teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scalar-tensor theory in teleparallel gravity where a general function of the scalar field, f(phi), is non-minimally coupled to the torsion scalar T. First, we derive the field equations in this framework. Then, we study the cosmological evolution in a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe described by the FRW metric, containing radiation and non-relativistic matter with energy densities rho_r and rho_m, respectively. We analyze the system as an autonomous dynamical model of dark energy. The cosmological behavior depends on the coupling function sigma = f'(phi)/sqrt(f(phi)) and the potential parameter lambda = [V'(phi) * f(phi)] / [V(phi) * f'(phi)]. A constant coupling sigma leads to a quadratic form f(phi) proportional to (phi + c)^2, while a constant lambda results in a power-law potential V(phi) proportional to f(phi)^lambda. These forms are supported by mathematical and physical considerations. We perform phase space analysis and show that lambda much greater than 1 is a necessary condition to obtain a radiation-dominated era with effective equation of state w_eff approximately 1/3 and a matter-dominated era with w_eff approximately 0. Moreover, small sigma^2 ensures radiation and matter dominance in the respective eras. Finally, we derive the necessary conditions for a viable cosmological trajectory in this setting.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Proca-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity with Primary Hair: Particle Motion, Shadows, and Grey-Body Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate classical and semiclassical signatures of black holes in a recently proposed Proca-Gauss-Bonnet gravity model that admits asymptotically flat solutions with primary hair. Two distinct classes of spherically symmetric metrics arise from different relations between the coupling constants of scalar-tensor and vector-tensor Gauss-Bonnet interactions. For each geometry, we examine the range of parameters permitting horizon formation and analyze the motion of test particles and light rays. We compute characteristic observables including the shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) frequency, and binding energy. Additionally, we study scalar and Dirac field perturbations, derive the corresponding effective potentials, and calculate the grey-body factors (GBFs) using both the sixth-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method and their correspondence with quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our results show that the QNM-based approximation of GBFs is accurate for sufficiently large multipole numbers and that deviations from Schwarzschild geometry become pronounced for large values of the Proca hair and Gauss-Bonnet couplings.</description>

      <title>Solving an Interacting Quintessence Model with a Sound Horizon Initial Condition and its Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical observations suggest that the current standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model in modern cosmology has some discrepancies when fitting the data during the whole expansion history of the universe. To solve the Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, usually an unknown mechanism is considered that shifts the sound horizon at the decoupling era. On the other hand, dynamical dark energy models are also considered to resolve the problems of the cosmological constant, and the additional degrees of freedom require initial conditions for a solution. In this article we have considered a coupled quintessence dark energy model with a special focus on its early-time behaviour. In our solution the initial conditions are naturally decided by setting the value of the sound horizon at the recombination time, $\theta^*$. We find that during this process, $H_0$ could be derived and its value rises with the coupling strength of the interaction. We also performed the background and cosmic microwave background power spectrum analysis, and find that the existence of the interaction term affects the energy density during a narrow time interval range and shifts the early cosmic microwave background spectrum. We also constrained the parameter space of the underlying scenario using the markov chain monte carlo analysis. We find that the best-fit values of $H_0$ and $S_8$ are improved slightly for the interacting model, but not enough to release the tensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently unveiled deep-field images from the James Webb Space Telescope have renewed interest in what we can and cannot see of the universe. Answering these questions requires understanding the so-called "cosmological horizons" and the "Hubble sphere". Here we review the topic of cosmological horizons in a form that university physics teachers can use in their lessons, using the latest data about the so-called standard "Lambda Cold Dark Matter" ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Graphical representations are plotted in terms of both conformal and proper coordinates as an aid to understanding the propagation of light in the expanding universe at various epochs.</description>

      <title>Possible Formation of Traversable Wormholes and Their Thermodynamic Analysis in $\mathcal{F}(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m},\mathcal{T})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate static and spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of the extended symmetric teleparallel gravity, specifically the $\mathcal{F}(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m},\mathcal{T})$ gravity theory, where $Q$, $\mathcal{L}_{m}$, and $\mathcal{T}$ are the respective representations of the non-metricity scalar, the matter Lagrangian, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. By employing a specific redshift function and deriving the shape function through the Karmarkar condition, we examine the fundamental geometric features required for a viable wormhole structure. The analysis confirms the satisfaction of key conditions such as the throat condition, flaring-out condition, and asymptotic flatness. A detailed study of energy conditions for various values of model parameters reveals that the null energy condition and averaged null energy condition are violated near the throat, indicating the presence of exotic matter. Additionally, thermodynamic quantities such as temperature, pressure, specific heat, work density, and energy flux are analyzed, all of which support the thermal and equilibrium stability of the wormhole. Our findings demonstrate that even in extended theories like $\mathcal{F}(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m},\mathcal{T})$ gravity, exotic matter remains essential for sustaining traversable wormholes. This work lays the foundation for further investigations into their stability under dynamical perturbations and potential astrophysical implications.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing gravity theories with networks of space-based gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for separating and detecting the non-tensor modes of stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) using networks of space-based gravitational-wave detectors. We consider four distinct data-reconstruction schemes for the co-inclination and anti-inclination orbital configurations of the LISA-Taiji network. We find that the co-inclination configuration offers its advantages over the anti-inclination one and can achieve signal-to-noise ratios up to 17.3 for the vector modes and 10.4 for the scalar modes with the energy density spectrum as $\Omega_{GW}^p(f)=10^{-12}$. Our method can be used to measure beyond-general-relativity polarization modes of SGWBs at mHz frequency band, opening a new avenue for testing alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes and reductions of thermodynamic phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic inconsistency observed in regular black holes is resolved through the framework of reduced thermodynamic phase spaces. We demonstrate that regular black holes are essentially induced from singular black holes by adding an extra requirement, which imposes a constraint among black hole parameters. This constraint reduces the thermodynamic phase space, rendering the standard form of the first law of black hole thermodynamics inapplicable. Accordingly, we propose a novel methodology to study the thermodynamic properties of regular black holes. Thermodynamic quantities must be defined in the full, unconstrained thermodynamic phase space of the underlying singular black holes, only afterward is the constraint imposed to derive the consistent and meaningful thermodynamic quantities of the regular black holes. Crucially, this framework extends beyond regular black holes and applies universally to any black hole with this kind of constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the amplitude of electromagnetic memory can be significantly enhanced in comparison to known estimates. In a Lorentz breaking phase of lowered phase velocity of light, there exist critical spacetime directions of memory-source emission along the effective light cone, about which the total memory offset receives order of magnitude increases. The same amplification is already present in the Lorentz preserving case by considering ultra-relativistic memory-source charges. These observations may pave the way for a first observation of the phenomenon of memory and laboratory tests of the concepts of asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems.</description>

      <title>Light Rings, Accretion Disks and Shadows of Hayward Boson Stars in asymptotically AdS Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ numerical methods to investigate the fundamental properties of Hayward boson stars and the optical appearance of their accretion disks in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Our results show that variations in the negative cosmological constant significantly affect the relationship between ADM mass and frequency, the critical magnetic monopole charge, the size of the photon ring, and the kinematic characteristics of particles at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Through ray-tracing studies of the accretion disk's appearance, we find that for non-frozen boson stars, the absence of an event horizon leads to multiple photon rings appearing within the central shadow region. In contrast, for frozen boson stars, the presence of a critical event horizon causes their images to resemble those of Schwarzschild black holes, with no additional photon rings appearing within the shadow region. Furthermore, the negative cosmological constant significantly alters the image structure: a smaller ISCO radius leads to photon rings being obscured at specific viewing angles, preventing their appearance within the shadow region.</description>

      <title>Matter power spectrum in a power-law $f(G)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological models based on $f(G)$ gravity are efficient in fitting different observational datasets at both background and perturbation levels. This motivates the current study to take into account dynamical system analysis to investigate the matter power spectrum within the framework of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity. After defining the dimensionless dynamical system variables for a power-law $f(G)$ model, We derive the full system of equations governing the energy density perturbations for both matter and Gauss-Bonnet fluids using the $1+3$ covariant formalism. After solving the energy density perturbation equations, we compute the matter power spectrum. The importance of studying first order perturbations for the defined $f(G)$ model and the relevance of different initial conditions in computing the matter power spectrum are also stressed. It is reported that matter power spectrum for $f(G)$ gravity, for a particular functional form of $f(G)$ model considered is not scale invariant as the case for General Relativity.</description>

      <title>A minisuperspace approach for the Supersymmetric Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a supersymmetric extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime in the framework of quantum cosmology. We achieve this by supersymmetrizing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model defined in the interior region between the event and Cauchy horizons. We carry out this analysis following the Dirac and the reduced phase space quantization approaches and compare them. In the quantum regime we describe the novelties introduced by supersymmetry and highlight the differences with the pure bosonic case. At the classical level we analyse some limits that lead to metrics which are different than the usual Reissner-Nordstr\"om form. We show that in some regions of the spacetime, true singularities arise. In addition, we study the geodesics equation of a massive particle moving in the region where supersymmetry contributions are dominant.</description>

      <title>Penrose hypothesis and instability of naked singularities in static spherically symmetric systems with scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativistic static spherically symmetric (SSS) asymptotically flat configurations with scalar fields typically contain naked singularities at the center. We consider minimally coupled scalar fields with power-law potentials leading to the Coulomb asymptotic of the field $\phi(r)\approx Q/r$ for large values of the radial variable r. The configurations are uniquely defined by total mass and a Q-parameter characterizing the strength of the scalar field at spatial infinity. The focus is on the linear stability against radial (monopole) perturbations of the SSS configurations satisfying conditions of asymptotic flatness. Our numerical investigations show the existence of divergent modes of small perturbations against the static background, at least for sufficiently small values of Q. This means instability of the configurations, confirming the well-known Penrose conjecture about the nonexistence of naked singularities - in this particular case. On the other hand, we have not found divergent modes of linear radial perturbations for sufficiently large Q.</description>

      <title>Constraints on parity and Lorentz violations from gravitational waves: a comparison between single-parameter and multi-parameter analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing catalog of gravitational wave (GW) detections by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration enables increasingly stringent tests of general relativity, particularly regarding possible parity and Lorentz violations. While most current analyses employ single-parameter methods, varying one deformation parameter at a time, modified gravity theories often predict multiple, coexisting deviations. In this work, we construct four specific multi-parameter GW waveform models incorporating parity- and Lorentz-violating effects and perform full Bayesian parameter estimation to compare multi-parameter and single-parameter constraints. We find that including multiple deformation parameters yields constraints on individual parameters that are generally comparable to those from single-parameter analyses, despite one specific model showing a degeneracy between the deformation parameters. Our results support the robustness of single-parameter tests for parity and Lorentz symmetry of gravity in current and future GW observations.</description>

      <title>On the Infeasibility of Low-Energy Warp Drive via Metamaterial Gravitational Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent ``low-energy'' warp-drive concepts propose replacing the constant gravitational coupling $\kappa_0$ with a spatially varying scalar field $\kappa(x)$ set by an engineered metamaterial's electromagnetic response. We show that the idea fails on both theoretical and experimental grounds. A prescribed, non-dynamical $\kappa(x)$ in the field equation $G^{\mu\nu} = \kappa(x)T^{\mu\nu}$ clashes with the contracted Bianchi identity, $\nabla_\mu G^{\mu\nu} \equiv 0$, forcing $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} \neq 0$ and thus violating local energy-momentum conservation. Making $\kappa(x)$ dynamical yields a scalar-tensor theory in which the scalar mediates a new long-range force that breaks the strong equivalence principle; Solar-System and pulsar-timing experiments already restrict $|\gamma - 1| \lesssim 10^{-5}$, excluding any technologically useful coupling. Junction-condition analysis further shows that any interface where $\kappa$ changes demands a $\delta$-function layer of stress-energy, while even steep continuous profiles are ruled out by torsion-balance, lunar-laser, and spacecraft Doppler measurements. Hence the concept is untenable: a non-dynamical scheme violates conservation laws, and its scalar-tensor completion is falsified by existing data..</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-like structure of the four-dimensional asymptotically flat Horndeski black holes is studied in detail. Focusing on the motion of massive neutral test particles, we construct the corresponding effective potential and classify the admissible types of orbits. The equations of motion are solved analytically, yielding trajectories expressed in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions and elementary functions. As an application, we compute the perihelion precession as a classical test of gravity within the Solar System and use it to place observational constraints on the coupling parameter between the scalar field and gravity.</description>

      <title>Evolution of superhorizon perturbations in early Universe with anisotropic solid remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study effects of presence of a small amount of so-called anisotropic solid remnant in the early post-inflationary Universe dominated by radiation. This model is inspired by solid inflation and its generalizations with matter described through a triplet of fields. In our model, the internal full global Euclidean symmetry of this triplet is broken, which leads to an anisotropic expansion of the Universe. Superhorizon scalar and vector perturbations grow, while behavior of tensor perturbations remains the same as in the standard case with Universe filled with only radiation. We also find a very interesting case within the limit of a very small amount of the anisotropic solid remnant and the longest possible duration of its presence, where size of vector perturbations decreases with a different power of scale factor as in the standard scenario. The obtained results improve agreement between the observational data and the theoretical predictions of solid inflation in a case with suppressed non-linear effects.</description>

      <title>Multi-shell Dirac fermions in the Einstein--Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-fermions in the spherically symmetric Einstein--Dirac system. Dirac fermions are self-localized within a spherically symmetric Einstein gravity, i.e., the Schwarzschild-like space-time metric. Most of previous studies of the Einstein--Dirac system are restricted to two neutral fermions or to many fermions with the same high-angular momentum filling a single shell. Our model considers full-filling of fermions in multiple shells, similarly to the conventional nuclear shell model. We solve the model for fermion numbers $N_\textrm{f}=2,6,12$ and $20$, which can realize a spherically-symmetric system. Even single-shell multi-fermions exhibit a multi-peak structure and fragmentation in the high redshift region. The behavior observed in our multi-shell model can be explained by interactions between the shells and resulting delocalization. We also investigate the pressure of the solutions which defines the existence (or absence) of inter-shell interactions. The radial pressure is attractive, supporting compactness of the solutions. Finally, we show the correlations between the nontrivial changes in the Shannon entropy (a logarithmic measure of information content) and the structural deformations of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the universal thermodynamic characteristics of black hole phase transitions in the low-temperature limit. Our results reveal that, far below the critical point, the near zero-temperature region also exhibits universal properties. By employing the Maxwell equal area law and analyzing the coexistence curve of black hole phase transitions, we derive three universal exponents: $\alpha=1$, $\beta=2$, and $\gamma=d-3$, where $d$ represents the spacetime dimension number. Furthermore, additional studies show that these exponents remain unchanged regardless of the black hole's charge and spin. These universal exponents provide valuable insights into enhancing our understanding of black hole thermodynamic phase transitions in low temperature and shed light on the fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on the thermodynamics of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black holes. A modified mass-temperature relation is derived under the assumption of local equilibrium, revealing that the black hole evolves into a stable remnant with a finite temperature, rather than completely evaporating. The corrected entropy, obtained within this framework, deviates from the commonly expected logarithmic form and aligns with similar findings in higher-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetimes. Our results support the argument that the GUP-induced corrections to the black hole entropy are sensitive to the dimension of spacetime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, we attempted to over-spin Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes with test fields satisfying the null energy condition. We derived that a non-generic over-spinning could be achieved with strict restrictions on the test field modes and the initial space-time parameters. Here, we incorporate the effect of the second order variations by evaluating the Sorce-Wald condition for Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes. We calculate the second variation of the area for the sub-collection of Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes for which over-spinning is possible due to first order perturbations. We carry out an analysis to second order, avoiding the common order of magnitude problems where the second order variations appear in the form of a product with the square of an additional small parameter. We derive that the contribution of the second order variations fix the final state of the space-time parameters driving the Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole away from extremality. The event horizon is preserved in accord with the cosmic censorship conjecture and the laws of black hole dynamics.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Joint Multiband Detection of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes by LGWA and the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band, making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs. We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers. Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$. The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.</description>

      <title>Epicyclic oscillations and accretion disk around a special Buchdahl-inspired spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime metric and investigate its aspects using the quasiperiodic oscillations and the accretion disk due to the accreting matter. First, we focus on analyzing the geodesics of particles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime, together with the conserved quantities such as specific energy and angular momentum for massive particles orbiting on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). We show that the effect of the Buchdahl parameter $\tilde{k}$ increases as the radii of the ISCO orbits decrease, resulting in shifting orbits toward the central object compared to the Schwarzschild black hole case. We also consider astrophysical epicyclic oscillations and derive their general expressions using implications of circular motion of massive particles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime. Further, we explore the astrophysical implications of observational higher-frequency QPOs of the selected galactic microquasars of X-ray binary systems to obtain the best-fit constraints on the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime parameters. Finally, we consider the accretion disk around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime using implications of the ISCO parameters that define the accretion disk's inner edge. We explore radiation properties of the accretion disk and redshifted image and intensity of a lensed accretion disk around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime.</description>

      <title>Note on identifying four-dimensional vacuum solutions from Weyl invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffeomorphism covariance is a fundamental property of General Relativity which leads to the fact that the same solution of Einstein equation can be given in completely distinct forms in different coordinates system. Distinguishing or identifying two metrics as solutions of Einstein equation is particularly challenging. In a recent paper arXiv:2503.14586 [hep-th], it is proposed to apply the relations of different Weyl invariants to distinguish solutions. In this note, we present a complementary application of the Weyl invariants. We verify from Weyl invariants that two metrics with completely different forms are the same solution. We also present the coordinates transformation that connects the two metrics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the FLRW apparent horizon in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the apparent horizon of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We use the generalized definition of entropy for gravity theories in higher dimensions to determine the main thermodynamic variables and to compare their behavior with the corresponding quantities in Einstein's theory, emphasizing the role of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and the dimension number. By imposing the validity of the laws of thermodynamics, we show that the apparent horizon can be interpreted thermodynamically as a dark energy fluid, independently of the coupling constant and the dimension number. Using the response functions, we determine the adiabatic index and the number of thermally accesible degrees of freedom of the apparent horizon and argue that this leads to a discretization of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Overlapping signals in next-generation gravitational wave observatories: A recipe for selecting the best parameter estimation technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable. The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps, where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify how much the overlapping signals affect it.We show it has 99% accuracy for zero noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.</description>

      <title>Algebraically special perturbations of the Kerr black hole: a metric formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbations of the Kerr black hole are notoriously difficult to describe in the metric formalism and are usually studied in terms of perturbations of the Weyl scalars. In this work, we focus on the algebraically special linear perturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr geometry and show how one can describe this subsector of the perturbations solely using the metric formulation. To that end, we consider the most general twisting algebraically special solution space of vacuum General Relativity. By linearizing around the Kerr solution, we obtain two coupled partial differential wave equations describing the dynamics of the Kerr ASLP. We provide an algorithm to solve them analytically in the small spin approximation up to third order, providing the first exact solution of this kind in the metric formulation. Then, we use this framework to study the zero modes of the Kerr geometry. We present the exact analytical form of the shifts in mass and spin together with the required change of coordinates needed to identify them. Finally, we also provide for the first time closed expressions for the solution-generating perturbations generating the NUT and acceleration charges, thus deforming the Kerr solution to the linearized Kerr-NUT and spinning C-metric. These results provide a first concrete and rare example of perturbations of the Kerr black hole which can be treated entirely in the metric formulation. They can serve as a useful testbed to search for hidden symmetries of the Kerr perturbations.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship with spinning particles in Kerr-(A)dS spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture by analyzing the dynamics of spinning timelike particles dropped along the rotational axis of an extremal Kerr (anti)de Sitter black hole. This idea was first considered in a seminal paper by Wald and later by Needham but both analyses were restricted to asymptotically flat spacetimes. We generalize these studies, involving spinning particles, to rotating spacetimes with non vanishing cosmological constant. We examine whether the absorption of such particles can overspin the black hole beyond extremality, potentially leading to the formation of a naked singularity. In asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, we find that particles that are captured cannot overspin the black hole. For generic initial conditions, similar conclusions hold also with anti-de Sitter asymptotics. However, in this case, we identify a narrow set of finely tuned trajectories, corresponding to particles injected very close to the horizon, that lead to the disruption of the event horizon.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction via Magnetic Reconnection in Kerr-Sen-AdS$_{4}$ Black Hole: Circular Plasma and Plunging Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the power and efficiency of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in the Kerr-Sen-AdS$_{4}$ black hole, focusing primarily on the circular orbit region and the plunging region. After introducing the black hole event horizon, boundary of the ergosphere, and photon sphere radius, we first study the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in circular orbit region. We plot the allowed regions for energy extraction and present the energy extraction power and efficiency, comparing them with the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. It was found that energy extraction is still possible even at a spin parameter of 0.5, which is lower than previous results, and the power can be higher than the BZ process in certain regions. In addition, we find the dilatonic scalar charge $b$ and the AdS radius $l$ contribute to lowering the spin threshold required for energy extraction. We also study the energy extraction in the plunging region by analyzing the allowed regions for energy extraction, and the power as well as efficiency. It was found that the energy extraction is possible even at a spin as low as 0.25. Especially, we find that parameter $b$ promotes lowering the energy extraction spin threshold while $l$ suppresses it, which is different from the circular orbit case. Moreover, the power and efficiency of energy extraction in the plunging region are higher than in the circular orbit region, indicating a stronger energy extraction capability in the plunging region.</description>

      <title>The thermal backreaction of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime should feel explicit thermal effects associated with its curvature. Starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum and a scalar field with small mass compared to the de Sitter curvature, we use the thermo-field dynamics formalism in order to expose these thermal effects. We compute the thermal Wightman function connecting two spacetime points and from it, via the point-splitting regularization technique, the renormalized thermal energy-momentum tensor. We then check how these corrections affect the de Sitter geometry by solving for the semi-classical backreaction and in order to put our result in a context, we compare it to the corresponding 2-loop quantum gravity correction to the cosmological constant derived in [1].</description>

      <title>Hiding Out at the Low End: No Gap and a Peak in the Black-Hole Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the existence of a gap in the mass spectrum of compact objects formed from stellar collapse, between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes, has been a matter of significant debate. The presence or absence of a mass gap has implications for the supernova mechanism, as well as being a fundamental property of the compact object mass function. In X-ray binaries containing black holes a gap is observed, but it is not known whether this is representative of a true gap in the mass function or due to selection effects or systematic biases in mass estimation. Binary black hole mergers detected from gravitational waves in the GWTC-3 transient catalog furnish a large sample of several tens of low-mass black holes with a well-understood selection function. Here we analyze the \nevts{} GWTC-3 merger events (along with GW230529\_181500) with at least one black hole ($3 \, M_\odot &lt; m_1$) and chirp masses below those of a $20\,M_\odot$--$20\,M_\odot$ merger ($\mathcal{M} &lt; 17.41 M_{\odot}$) to uncover the structure of the low-mass black hole mass function. Using flexible parameterized models for the mass function, we find, similar to existing studies, a sharp peak in the mass function at $m \simeq (8-10 M_{\odot})$. We observe a steady decline in the merger rate to lower masses, but by less than an order of magnitude in total, and find that the first percentile of black hole masses in our most flexible model is $m_{1\%} =3.13^{+0.18}_{-0.04}$. In other words, this sample of low-mass black holes is not consistent with the existence of a mass gap.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation for a massive charged field in a uniform electric field has a symmetry of two-dimensional global de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the in-out formalism the mean numbers of spinors (spin-1/2 fermions) and scalars (spin-0 bosons) spontaneously produced by the uniform electric field are exactly found from the Bogoliubov relations both in the global and planar coordinates of (A)dS$_2$ space. We show that the uniform electric field enhances the production of charged spinor and scalar pairs in the planar and global dS space while the AdS space reduces the pair production in which weak electric fields below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound prohibits pair production. The leading Boltzmann factor in dS space can be written as the Gibbons-Hawking radiation or Schwinger effect with e-folding factors less than one that give the QED effect or the curvature effect. We observe that dS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ spaces are connected by QED, such as a reciprocal relation between the mean number of spinors and scalars provided that the spacetime curvature is analytically continued. The leading behavior of the mean numbers for spinors and scalars is explained as a sum of contour integrals of the frequency in the phase-integral formulation.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Structure Formation, Recombination, and Matter--Radiation Equality in \textbf{$f(R, L_m)$} Gravity and \textbf{$\Lambda$}CDM Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of three pivotal epochs in cosmic history: structure formation, recombination, and matter-radiation equality, within the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity and the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using a nonlinear evolution equation for density perturbations, we determine the collapse redshift ($z_c$), showing that cosmic structures form earlier in $f(R, L_m)$ gravity due to enhanced effective gravitational coupling. Recombination is studied via the visibility function $g(z)$, peaking at $z_{\mathrm{rec}} \approx 1092.6$ in both models, consistent with Planck 2018 data. We compute the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $g(z)$ and find a slightly extended decoupling duration in $f(R, L_m)$. Finally, we analyze the evolution of energy densities and determine the matter-radiation equality redshift as $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 4203$ in $f(R, L_m)$ and $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 2779$ in $\Lambda$CDM, with corresponding cosmic times of approximately $67{,}756$ and $67{,}232$ years, respectively. These results confirm that $f(R, L_m)$ gravity retains key cosmological landmarks while introducing testable deviations from the standard paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the highest weight representation (HWR) of the three and four-dimensional Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra realized on the codimension-two boundary of asymptotic flat spacetime (AFS). In such a realization, the action of supertranslation shifts the conformal weight of the highest-weight states. As a result, there is no extra quantum number relating to the supertranslation. We construct the highest-weight BMS modules and compute their characters. We show that the vacuum character of BMS$_3$ exactly agrees with the 1-loop partition function of three-dimensional asymptotic flat gravity. We expect the vacuum character of BMS$_4$ may shed light on the flat holography in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Gravity and Gravitational Waves with Radio Pulsars: Advances and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsars, the cosmic lighthouses, are strongly self-gravitating objects with core densities significantly exceeding nuclear density. Since the discovery of the Hulse--Taylor pulsar 50 years ago, binary pulsar studies have delivered numerous stringent tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime as well as its radiative properties -- gravitational waves (GWs). These systems also enable high-precision neutron star mass measurements, placing tight constraints on the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. In addition, pulsars act as natural detectors for nanohertz GWs, primarily from supermassive black hole binaries, culminating in the first reported evidence of a stochastic GW background in 2023. In this article, I review key milestones in pulsar research and highlight some of contributions from my own work. After a brief overview of the gravity experiments in \S 1, I review the discovery of pulsars -- particularly those in binaries -- and their critical role in gravity experiments (\S 2) that laid the foundation for recent advances. In \S 3, I present the latest efforts on GR tests using the Double Pulsar and a pioneer technique to constrain the dense matter equation of state. \S 4 demonstrates the potential of binary pulsars on testing alternative theories to GR. Advances in nanohertz GW detection with pulsar timing arrays are discussed in \S 5. I outline some of the current challenges in \S 6 and conclude with final remarks in \S 7.</description>

      <title>The multiplicity distributions of the high frequency gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the gravitons are created thanks to the variation of the space-time curvature the multiplicity distributions quantify the probability of producing a given number of species around the average occupation numbers of the underlying multiparticle states. The multiplicities of the relic gravitons are infinitely divisible and their analytical expressions encompass, in different regions of the physical parameters, the Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma and Pascal probability distributions. Depending upon the post-inflationary timelines, the averaged multiplicities are controlled by the range of the comoving frequencies and they can be much larger in the GHz region than in the aHz domain where the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the microwave background set strict limits on the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons. Thanks to the absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency of the gravitons we can acknowledge that the averaged multiplicities are exponentially suppressed above the THz, where only few pairs of gravitons are independently created from the vacuum. The statistical properties of the produced particles can be finally interpreted in the light of the second-order interference effects and this perspective is quantitatively scrutinized by analyzing the associated quantum sensitivities. For putative instruments reaching spectral amplitudes ${\mathcal O}(10^{-35})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the MHz or GHz bands, the Bose-Einstein correlations could be used to probe the properties of cosmic gravitons and their super-Poissonian statistics. Both from the theoretical and observational viewpoint it is unjustified to require the same sensitivities (e.g. ${\mathcal O}(10^{-21})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$) in the kHz and GHz domains.</description>

      <title>Negative entropy and non-equilibrium Euclidean shell</title>

Abstract: The Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) approach is traditionally developed for a Euclidean path integral derivation of black hole entropy. In this work, we extend this approach to a static model of thin shell fixed outside a black hole. We compute the Euclidean action shift from a static thin shell outside the black hole, and find exact agreement with Casini's version of Bekenstein bound. We find a negative entropy deficit corresponding precisely to the apparent horizon area perturbation, which provides a holographic interpretation in terms of extremal surfaces.
  Therefore, we develop a Euclidean framework in which gravity emerges from a negative entropy gradient. This setup allows us to treat the configuration as a near-equilibrium steady state (NESS). Thus, we introduce Onsager reciprocity and a linear-response relation to clarify the entropic force conjecture. A dissipating external force is necessary in this setup and it generates a Hawking temperature gradient which encoding information responsible for entropy gradient. This confirms that the gravitational potential plays the role of an informational and ordering agent, rather than just driven by chaotic and disordering.</description>

      <title>The Toll of the Tolman Effect: On the Status of Classical Temperature in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tolman effect is well-known in relativistic cosmology but rarely discussed outside it. That is surprising because the effect -- that systems extended over a varying gravitational potential exhibit temperature gradients while in thermal equilibrium -- conflicts with ordinary classical thermodynamics. In this paper we try to better understand this effect from a foundational perspective. We make five claims. First, as Tolman knew, it was Einstein who first discovered the effect, and furthermore, Einstein's derivation helps us appreciate how robust it is. Second, the standard interpretation of the effect in terms of 'local temperature' leads to the breakdown of much of classical thermodynamics. Third, one can rescue thermodynamics by using Einstein's preferred interpretation in terms of the 'wahre Temperatur' -- what we'll call global temperature -- but it too has some costs. Fourth, the effect is perhaps best understood in terms of clocks as opposed to energy loss. Fifth, inspired by a proposal of Einstein's elsewhere, we sketch an interpretation of the effect in terms of a third novel temperature, which we call the 'wahre-local temperature'. On this view, temperature -- and thermodynamics -- is defined only in relation to local clocks. In sum, we view the fragmentation of temperature in thermodynamics as a natural and expected result of the fragmentation of time in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Resolving Degeneracies in Complex $\mathbb{R}\times S^3$ and $\theta$-KSW</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentzian gravitational path integral for the Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $4D$ is studied in the mini-superspace ansatz for metric. The gauge-fixed path-integral for Robin boundary choice is computed exactly using {\it Airy}-functions, where the dominant contribution comes from No-boundary geometries. The lapse integral is further analysed using saddle-point methods to compare with exact results. Picard-Lefschetz methods are utilized to find the {\it relevant} complex saddles and deformed contour of integration thereby using WKB methods to compute the integral along the deformed contour in the saddle-point approximation. However, their successful application is possible only when system is devoid of degeneracies, which in present case appear in two types: {\bf type-1} where the flow-lines starting from neighbouring saddles overlap leading to ambiguities in deciding the {\it relevance} of saddles, {\bf type-2} where saddles merge for specific choices of boundary parameters leading to failure of WKB. Overcoming degeneracies using artificial {\it defects} introduces ambiguities due to choice of {\it defects} involved. Corrections from quantum fluctuations of scale-factor overcome degeneracies only partially (lifts {\bf type-2} completely with partial resolution of {\bf type-1}), with the residual lifted fluently by complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$. {\it Anti-linear} symmetry present in various forms in the lapse action is the reason behind all the {\bf type-1} degeneracies. Any form of {\it defect} or {\it deformation} breaking anti-linearity resolves {\bf type-1} degeneracies, indicating complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$ as an ideal choice. Compatibility with the KSW criterion is analyzed after symmetry breaking. Complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$ modifies the KSW criterion, imposing a strong constraint on the deformation if No-boundary geometries are required to be always KSW-allowed.</description>

      <title>Stability of relativistic tidal response against small potential modification</title>

Abstract: The tidal response of compact objects in an inspiraling binary system is measured by a set of tidal Love and dissipation numbers imprinted in the gravitational waveforms. While a four-dimensional black hole in vacuum within General Relativity has vanishing Love numbers, a black hole in alternative theories of gravity can acquire non-vanishing Love numbers. The dissipation numbers may quantify Planckian corrections at the horizon scale. These properties will allow a test of classical theories of gravity in the strong-field regime with gravitational-wave observation. Since black holes are not in the exact vacuum environment in astrophysical situations, the following question arises: can the environment affect the tidal response? In this paper, we investigate the stability of the tidal response of a Schwarzschild black hole for frequency-dependent tidal-field perturbations against a small modification of the background. Our analysis relies on the scattering theory, which overcomes difficulties in computing the relativistic tidal Love numbers. The tidal Love and dissipation numbers can be understood from the property of sufficiently low-frequency scattering waves. We show that the tidal Love numbers are sensitive to the property of the modification. Therefore, we need careful consideration of the environment around the black hole in assessing the deviation of the underlying theory of gravity from General Relativity with the Love numbers. The modification has less impact on the dissipation numbers, indicating that quantifying the existence of the event horizon with them is not spoiled. We also demonstrate that in a composite system, i.e., a compact object with environmental effects, the Love and dissipation numbers are approximately determined by the sum of the numbers of each component.</description>

      <title>Extracting linear and nonlinear quasinormal modes from black hole merger simulations</title>

Abstract: In general relativity, when two black holes merge they produce a rotating (Kerr) black hole remnant. According to perturbation theory, the remnant emits "ringdown" radiation: a superposition of exponentials with characteristic complex frequencies that depend only on the remnant's mass and spin. While the goal of the black hole spectroscopy program is to measure the quasinormal mode frequencies, a knowledge of their amplitudes and phases is equally important to determine which modes are detectable, and possibly to perform additional consistency checks. Unlike the complex frequencies, the amplitudes and phases depend on the properties of the binary progenitors, such as the binary mass ratio and component spins. In this paper we develop a fitting algorithm designed to reliably identify the modes present in numerical simulations and to extract their amplitudes and phases. We apply the algorithm to over 500 binary black hole simulations from the public SXS numerical relativity simulation catalog, and we present fitting formulas for the resulting mode amplitudes and phases as functions of the properties of the progenitors. Crucially, our algorithm allows for the extraction of not only prograde fundamental modes and overtones, but also retrograde modes and second-order modes. We unveil interesting relations for the amplitude ratios of different modes. The fitting code and interactive versions of some of the plots are publicly available. The results presented in this paper can be updated as more and better simulations become available.</description>

      <title>Inferred Hubble Parameter from Gravitational Waves in a Perturbative Bianchi I Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is straightforward to take the gravitational wave solution to first order in $v/c$ far from a binary source in a Minkowski background and adapt it to the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, representing an expanding isotropic and homogeneous universe. We find the analogous solution for a slightly anisotropic background, which may be a more accurate description of our late universe through which gravitational waves propagate, and implications from tight CMB anisotropy constraints may not necessarily determine the level of anisotropy in the late universe in light of modified gravity models as well as the Hubble tension. We use a perturbative form of the Bianchi I metric and demonstrate how the waveform differs. Using supernova anisotropy data as a reference, we show that the assumption of a Bianchi I background could imply on average a 2.1\% difference in inferred luminosity distance compared to what would be inferred under the assumption of the FLRW background. This difference can be as high as 5.9\% depending on the observation direction. Therefore, the background spacetime used for the inference of the Hubble parameter from gravitational wave data should be considered carefully.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group improved cosmology in the presence of a stiff matter era</title>

Abstract: In \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.103004}{Phys. Rev. D 92 (2015) 103004}, simple analytical solutions of the Friedman equations were obtained for a universe having stiff matter component in the early universe together with a dark matter, and a dark energy component. In this analysis, the universe is considered to be made of a dark fluid which behaves as a stiff matter in the early phase of the universe (when the internal energy dominates). It is also more logical to consider quantum gravitational effects in the early phase of the cosmological evolution. In this analysis, following \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508}{Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 043508}, we consider renormalization group improved modified Friedmann equations where the Newton's gravitational constant (G) and the cosmological constant (\Lambda) flows with the momentum scale of the universe. It is observed that for a universe undergoing a stiff matter era, radiation era, and matter era, inflation is absent in the early time regime of the universe when the flow of the Newton's gravitational constant and cosmological constant is under consideration. Using the identification of the momentum scale with the scale factor of the universe, we then explore the era $t&gt;t_{\text{Pl}}$ which indicates a primarily matter dominated era with accelerated expansion due to the presence of dark energy. Finally, considering the total equation of state as a combination of linear equation of state along with a polytropic equation of state, we observe that after the Planck-time the universe can undergo an inflationary phase and we find out that the inflation is enhanced by quantum gravitational effects arising due to the consideration of renormalization group approach to quantum gravity</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the cosmic expansion scenarios in the $f(R, L_m)$ gravity studied by using the dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameters. We proceed with the specific form of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity termed as $f(R, L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_{m}^{\alpha}$. We derive the expansion rate in terms of the red-shift for two different forms of EoS parameter. In first model, EoS parameter varies inversely with the redshift and in second model, it involves the exponential form with the redshift. By using the Bayesian methods based on the $\chi^{2}$-minimization technique, the median values of model parameters are determined for the cosmic chronometer(CC) and Joint (CC+Pantheon) data sets. The behavior of fundamental cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, energy density and pressure are thoroughly examined. Additionally, the nature of Statefinder diagnostics and the present age of universe exemplifies the compatibility with the late-time astronomical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog gravity systems have the unique opportunity to probe theoretical aspects of black hole physics in a controlled laboratory environment that one cannot easily observe for astrophysical black holes. In this work, we address the question of whether one could use controlled initial perturbations to excite the black hole ringdown and infer the effective black hole metric. Using a theory-agnostic ansatz for the effective metric described by the Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric and evolving perturbations on that background, we quantify with Bayesian analysis what regions of the effective spacetime could be constrained in experiments. In contrast to standard ringdown analyses based on quasi-normal mode extraction, a laboratory-controlled setup, in combination with our framework, allows one to model the entire signal, including the prompt response and possible effects of late-time tails. Therefore, it has the intriguing advantage of not relying on start and end times when the superposition of quasi-normal modes is a good signal approximation. It also avoids the non-trivial question of how many modes are present. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible in principle and discuss opportunities beyond this study.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of Einstein equations in the Fully Constrained Formulation: local-uniqueness, post-Newtonian expansion and initial data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein equations can be written in the so-called Fully Constrained Formulation (FCF). This formulation has two different sectors: the elliptic sector, formed by the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints together with the equations derived from the gauge choice; and the hyperbolic sector, formed by the evolution of the rest of the spacetime metric variables, which encodes the gravitational radiation. In this work, we present a modification of both sectors that keeps local uniqueness properties of the elliptic system of equations and includes a hierarchical post-Newtonian structure of all the elliptic and hyperbolic equations. This reformulation can have potential applications in cosmology and relativistic astrophysics. Moreover, we show how initial stationary data can be computed numerically using this formulation without assuming a conformally flat spatial metric, with the illustrative example of a rotating neutron star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note includes results of a study of stationary spherically symmetric ``dark holes'', objects merging central black holes and peripheral scalar graviton dark haloes arising in the framework of the modified gravity -- the quartet-metric, or more appropriately, multiscalar-metric gravity with spontaneously broken relativity as a gauge symmetry [1]. An exact solution to be considered as a basic one for the dark holes is presented. This solution may, in principle, be used for a qualitative description of the effect of asymptotically flat rotation curves in galaxies. To convert the basic solution into a more realistic one suitable for astrophysical applications, a family of modified solutions is considered. These solutions are studied numerically for representative set of free parameters.
  These results were reported in the talk [2] but not included into the proceedings [3] due to article length limitations. The note can be considered as a supplement to this reference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution embedded within a dark matter (DM) halo, formulated as a non-vacuum extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical density profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60), incorporating Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, stellar velocity dispersion data, and globular cluster dynamics. The resultant spacetime metric depends on three independent parameters: the black hole mass $M$, the asymptotic circular velocity $V_c$, and the halo scale radius $a$, and smoothly reduces to the Schwarzschild limit as $V_c \to 0$ and $a \to 0$. We analyze the influence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the event horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The Kretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced modifications, particularly in the near-horizon regime. Thermodynamic properties of the solution are also examined. In the extremal limit, characterized by a vanishing surface gravity, the model supports a finite tangential pressure, implying a non-trivial extension of standard black hole thermodynamics. These results highlight the relevance of incorporating astrophysical environments into BH modeling and offer new avenues for testing strong-field gravity through precision observational data.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian renormalisation IX. U(1)**3 quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormalisation of free field theories in all spacetime dimensions or interacting theories in spacetime dimensions lower than four. In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the U(1)**3 model for Euclidian general relativity in four spacetime dimensions which is self-interacting.
  The Hamiltonian flow needs as an input a choice of *-algebra and corresponding representation thereof or state on it at each resolution scale. If one uses as input the algebras and states that were used in the recent exact solutions of this model, then one finds that the flow finds as fixed point those exact solution theories.</description>

      <title>Constraining a $f(R, L_m)$ Gravity Cosmological Model with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a spatially flat FLRW cosmological model in the framework of modified gravity described by the function \( f(R, L_m) = \alpha R + L_m^\beta + \gamma \), where \( L_m \) is the matter Lagrangian density. The modified Friedmann equations yield the Hubble parameter as $ H(z) = H_0 \sqrt{(1 - \lambda) + \lambda (1 + z)^{3(1 + w)}},$
  with the parameters \( \lambda = \frac{\gamma}{6\alpha H_0^2} + 1 \) and \( w = \frac{\beta(n - 2) + 1}{2\beta - 1} \). Using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we constrain the model parameters with recent observational data, including cosmic chronometers, the Pantheon+ Supernovae dataset, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters. The best-fit values are found to be \( H_0 = 72.773^{+0.148}_{-0.152} \) km/s/Mpc, \( \lambda = 0.289^{+0.007}_{-0.007} \), and \( w = -0.002^{+0.002}_{-0.002} \), all quoted at the 1\(\sigma\) confidence level.This model predicts a transition redshift of \( z_t \approx 0.76 \) for the onset of cosmic acceleration and an estimated universe age of 13.21 Gyr. The higher inferred value of \( H_0 \) compared to the Planck 2018 result offers a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Additionally, using \( \rho_0 = 0.534 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{g/cm}^3 \) and assuming \( n = 1 \), we derive the model constants as \( \beta = 1.00201 \), \( \alpha = 512247 \), and \( \gamma = -1.215 \times 10^{-29} \). We also evaluate the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to compare the model's performance with that of the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model. The small BIC difference (\( \Delta \text{BIC} = 0.16 \)) indicates comparable statistical support for both models. Thus, the \( f(R, L_m) \) gravity scenario serves as a consistent and viable alternative to \(\Lambda\)CDM, potentially addressing open questions in late-time cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the difference between the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}$ attributed to the Hawking radiation from the de Sitter cosmological horizon and the twice as high local temperature of the de Sitter state, $T=H/\pi=2T_{\rm GH}$, has been discussed by Hughes and Kusmartsev from the topological point of view (see arXiv:2505.05814). According to their approach, this difference is determined by the Euler characteristic $\chi({\cal M})$ of the considered spacetime with Euclidean time. The invariant $\chi({\cal M})$ is different for the global spacetime ${\cal M}=S^4$ and for the manifold limited to a region near the horizon, ${\cal M}=D^2\times S^2$. Here we consider the application of the topological approach to Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes with two horizons. Both the outer and inner horizons are characterized by their near-horizon topology, which determines the corresponding horizon temperatures. As a result of the correlation between the horizons, the entropy of the RN black hole is independent of its electric charge, being completely determined by the mass of the black hole. This demonstrates the applicability of the topological approach to the multi-horizon systems.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the bright ring-like features and polarization structures
  in the Kerr-Sen black hole's images based on general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, which are illuminated by the 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Using the REx method, we extracted the bright ring from the black hole images and found that both the bright ring and black hole shadow shrink as the dilation parameter increases. Combing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters for different observed inclinations and disk thicknesses. Our results show that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observed inclination. We also probe the rotational symmetry of EVPA in the polarization structure of the black hole images by analyzing the coefficient $\beta_2$. The dilaton parameter results in that the real part $Re\beta_2$ increases and the imaginary part $Im\beta_2$ decreases, but the magnitude $|\beta_2|$ generally exhibits a declining trend. Finally, we find that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.03780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study aspects of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) quantum gravity in two-dimensional nearly de Sitter (dS) spacetime, as well as pure de Sitter quantum gravity in three dimensions. These are each theories of boundary modes, which include a reparameterization field on each connected component of the boundary as well as topological degrees of freedom. In two dimensions, the boundary theory is closely related to the Schwarzian path integral, and in three dimensions to the quantization of coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group. Using these boundary theories we compute loop corrections to the wavefunction of the universe, and investigate gravitational contributions to scattering. Along the way, we show that JT gravity in dS$_2$ is an analytic continuation of JT gravity in Euclidean AdS$_2$, and that pure gravity in dS$_3$ is a continuation of pure gravity in Euclidean AdS$_3$. We define a genus expansion for de Sitter JT gravity by summing over higher genus generalizations of surfaces used in the Hartle-Hawking construction. Assuming a conjecture regarding the volumes of moduli spaces of such surfaces, we find that the de Sitter genus expansion is the continuation of the recently discovered AdS genus expansion. Then both may be understood as coming from the genus expansion of the same double-scaled matrix model, which would provide a non-perturbative completion of de Sitter JT gravity.</description>

      <title>Emergent unitarity in de Sitter from matrix integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.12358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with positive cosmological constant as a model for de Sitter quantum gravity. We focus on the quantum mechanics of the model at past and future infinity. There is a Hilbert space of asymptotic states and an infinite-time evolution operator between the far past and far future. This evolution is not unitary, although we find that it acts unitarily on a subspace up to non-perturbative corrections. These corrections come from processes which involve changes in the spatial topology, including the nucleation of baby universes. There is significant evidence that this 1+1 dimensional model is dual to a 0+0 dimensional matrix integral in the double-scaled limit. So the bulk quantum mechanics, including the Hilbert space and approximately unitary evolution, emerge from a classical integral. We find that this emergence is a robust consequence of the level repulsion of eigenvalues along with the double scaling limit, and so is rather universal in random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from random entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct entangled microstates of a pair of holographic CFTs whose dual semiclassical description includes big bang-big crunch AdS cosmologies in spaces without boundaries. The cosmology is supported by inhomogeneous heavy matter and it partially purifies the bulk entanglement of two disconnected auxiliary AdS spacetimes. We show that the island formula for the fine grained entropy of one of the CFTs follows from a standard gravitational replica trick calculation. In generic settings, the cosmology is contained in the entanglement wedge of one of the two CFTs. We then investigate properties of the cosmology-to-boundary encoding map, and in particular, its non-isometric character. Restricting our attention to a specific class of states on the cosmology, we provide an explicit, and state-dependent, boundary representation of operators acting on the cosmology. Finally, under genericity assumptions, we argue for a non-isometric to approximately-isometric transition of the cosmology-to-boundary map for ``simple'' states on the cosmology as a function of the bulk entanglement, with tensor network toy models of our setup as a guide.</description>

      <title>Magnets are Weber Bar Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave (GW) passes through a DC magnetic field, it couples to the conducting wires carrying the currents which generate the magnetic field, causing them to oscillate at the GW frequency. The oscillating currents then generate an AC component through which the GW can be detected - thus forming a resonant mass detector or a Magnetic Weber Bar. We quantify this claim and demonstrate that magnets can have exceptional sensitivity to GWs over a frequency range demarcated by the mechanical and electromagnetic resonant frequencies of the system; indeed, we outline why a magnetic readout strategy can be considered an optimal Weber bar design. The concept is applicable to a broad class of magnets, but can be particularly well exploited by the powerful magnets being deployed in search of axion dark matter, for example by DMRadio and ADMX-EFR. Explicitly, we demonstrate that the MRI magnet that is being deployed for ADMX-EFR can achieve a broadband GW strain sensitivity of $\sim$$10^{-20}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ from a few kHz to about 10 MHz, with a peak sensitivity down to $\sim$$10^{-22}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at a kHz exploiting a mechanical resonance.</description>

      <title>Pure geometric $f(R)$ branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate pure geometric $f(R)$ cosmology branes embedded in five-dimensional spacetime. The form of $f(R)$ is chosen as a polynomial. The Five-dimensional scalar curvature $R$ is assumed to be constant. Based on the value of the four-dimensional cosmological constant $\lambda_4$, the branes can be classified into Minkowski, de Sitter, and de anti-de Sitter cases. Solutions for each case can be calculated. These solutions are stable against linear tensor perturbations in all cases. In the Minkowski brane case, the zero mode of gravity can be localized on the brane. In the de Sitter brane case, the zero mode and one massive Kaluza-Klein mode can be localized on the brane. In the anti-de Sitter brane case, all massive Kaluza-Klein modes can be localized on the brane. The results of the analysis of tensor fluctuations are the same in both the Einstein frame and the Jordan frame.</description>

      <title>Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter space. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubbled-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time-scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions have emerged as compelling candidates for describing the dark sector of the Universe. In this work, we explore quintessence models inspired by axion-like potentials as a dynamical alternative to the cosmological constant. These models naturally exhibit a tracking behaviour, reducing the need for fine-tuned initial conditions. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on a complete cosmological dataset of Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB), DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, low-$z$ Cepheid anchors, and DES Y1 large scale structure measurement. Unfortunately, neither the Hubble tension nor the $S_8$ tension is eased. The model does reach parity with $\Lambda$CDM model statistically according to DIC, WAIC and Bayesian ratio, suggesting that a quintessence model may still help with the cosmic tension by further extending the model we have investigated.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Ricci-flat metrics in four dimensions that are stationary and algebraically special, together with the locally asymptotically flat conditions in the generalized Bondi-Sachs framework. We show that the Einstein equation is reduced to Laplacian equation on the celestial sphere. The solutions consist of two pairs of arbitrary holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions analogous to the Virasoro modes. We prove that the higher modes of one pair of the (anti-)holomorphic function contain an infinite tower of soft hairs from the perspectives of the asymptotic supertranslation charges. We verify that different modes of the soft hairs are distinct solutions which cannot be connected by diffeomorphism from the Weyl invariants associated to the solutions.</description>

      <title>Accelerating LISA inference with Gaussian processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Source inference for deterministic gravitational waves is a computationally demanding task in LISA. In a novel approach, we investigate the capability of Gaussian Processes to learn the posterior surface in order to reconstruct individual signal posteriors. We use GPry, which automates this reconstruction through active learning, using a very small number of likelihood evaluations, without the need for pretraining. We benchmark GPry against the cutting-edge nested sampler nessai, by injecting individually three signals on LISA noisy data simulated with Balrog: a white dwarf binary (DWD), a stellar-mass black hole binary (stBHB), and a super-massive black hole binary (SMBHB). We find that GPry needs $\mathcal O(10^{-2})$ fewer likelihood evaluations to achieve an inference accuracy comparable to nessai, with Jensen-Shannon divergence $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.01$ for the DWD, and $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.05$ for the SMBHB. Lower accuracy is found for the less Gaussian posterior of the stBHB: $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.2$. Despite the overhead costs of GPry, we obtain a speed-up of $\mathcal O(10^2)$ for the slowest cases of stBHB and SMBHB. In conclusion, active-learning Gaussian process frameworks show great potential for rapid LISA parameter inference, especially for costly likelihoods, enabling suppression of computational costs without the trade-off of approximations in the calculations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from primordial black hole dominance: The effect of inflaton decay rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario during the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field. We consider, in particular, a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian peak inflationary power spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density fluctuations before the end of inflation. These modes can reenter the horizon during preheating and could experience instabilities that trigger the production of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalism that takes into account non-spherical effects. We derive an accurate analytical expression for the mass fraction under the KP formalism that fits well with the numerical evaluation. Particularly, we focus on ultra-light PBH of masses $M_{\text{PBH}}&lt;10^9g$ and study their evolution and (possible) dominance after the decay of the inflation field into radiation and before the PBH evaporation via Hawking radiation. These considerations alter the previous estimates of induced gravitational waves (GWs) from PBH dominance and set new targets for detecting stochastic GW backgrounds with future detectors, provided that these achieve significantly enhanced experimental sensitivity, as current planned instruments do not yet possess sufficient sensitivity for detection.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Apples Falling, Buckets Rolling, and Why Inertia Keeps Trolling: Inertial Motion is Not Natural Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertia has long been treated as the paradigm of natural motion. This paper challenges this identification through the lens of General Relativity. Drawing on Norton (2012)'s distinction between idealisation and approximation and analysing key results from Tamir (2012) on the theorems of Geroch-Jang, Ehlers-Geroch, Einstein-Grommer, and Geroch-Traschen, I argue that geodesic motion -- commonly treated as the relativistic expression of inertia -- fails to qualify as either. Rather, geodesic motion is best understood as a useful construct -- a formal artefact of the theory's geometric structure, without real or fictitious instantiation, and excluded by the dynamical structure of General Relativity. In place of inertial motion, I develop a layered account of natural motion, which is not encoded in a single "master equation of motion." Extended, structured, and backreacting bodies require successively refined dynamical formalisms that systematically depart from geodesic motion. This pluralist framework displaces geodesic motion as the privileged expression of pure gravitational motion, replacing it with a dynamically grounded hierarchy of approximations fully consistent with the Einstein field equations. Inertial motion thus emerges not as the universal default of motion under gravity alone, but as a formal construct that stands apart from the pluralistic framework in which natural motion is genuinely realised.</description>

      <title>A review of applications of Quantum Energy Teleportation: from experimental tests to thermodynamics and spacetime engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) exploits the existence of correlations to enable remote energy transfer without the need for physical energy carriers between emitter and receiver. This paper presents a review of the thermodynamic foundations of QET and reviews its first experimental demonstration (performed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), along with its implementation on publicly available superconducting quantum hardware. Additionally, we review an application of QET in the field of quantum thermodynamics as an efficient algorithmic cooling technique to cool down individual parts of interacting systems. Finally, we will review how QET can be employed to optimally generate exotic quantum states characterized by negative average stress-energy densities, offering a new operational approach to engineering such states which are promising in the context of semiclassical gravity.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian renormalisation VIII. P(Phi,2) quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormalisation of free field theories in all spacetime dimensions. In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the self-interacting scalar field in two spacetime dimensions with polynomial potential, called P(Phi,2). We consider only the finite volume case.
  The P(Phi,2) theory is one of the few interacting QFT's that can be rigorously constructed non-perturbatively. We find that our Hamiltonian renormalisation flow finds this theory indeed as a fixed point.</description>

      <title>Fully general relativistic description of rapidly-rotating axially-symmetric neutron stars for constraining nuclear matter equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Constraining the nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) from neutron star observations is one of the main subjects in nuclear physics today. In general, neutron stars rotate rapidly and structure of neutron stars can be affected, especially in millisecond pulsars. To better constrain the nuclear EoS, it is important to describe neutron star structure taking into account the effects of rotation in a fully relativistic manner. Purpose: In this study, we investigate the internal structure of neutron stars under the influence of rotation. We explore correlations between rotational effects and EoS parameters, based on realistic calculations of rapidly rotating neutron stars based on the KEH method, which provides stable solutions for axially symmetric rotating equilibrium configurations. Results: Using 5 different Skyrme EoS parameter sets, we find that the maximum angular frequency achievable by rotating neutron stars, as calculated via the KEH method, varies depending on the stiffness of the equation of state. We confirm that an increase in the rotating frequency leads to an overall increase in both the mass and radius along the M-R curve. By performing calculations at two frequently referenced neutron stars, we further examine how the changes in mass and radius correlate with the nuclear matter properties at saturation density. Our results suggest that the 716Hz rotational constraint may require a more conservative interpretation when accounting for realistic stellar deformation effects. Conclusions: To place stringent constraints on the nuclear EoS based on observational data, it is sometimes essential to account for the effects of rotation in neutron star models. In particular, the influence of rotation becomes increasingly significant at higher spin frequencies and cannot be neglected in rapidly rotating systems with $&gt;$400Hz.</description>

      <title>Stretched Horizon Dissipation and the Fate of Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the dissipation of infalling particles near black holes under the assumption that the equivalence principle breaks down at the stretched horizon. This violation allows partial reflection of particles just outside the event horizon, as suggested by models such as the fuzzball and firewall proposals. We show that scattering with blue-shifted Hawking radiation leads to moderate dissipation when the particle energy is comparable to the Hawking temperature. The decay rate is independent of the Planck mass, and therefore gravitational wave echoes-arising from such partial reflection-may survive despite the presence of quantum gravitational effects. Our result is universal and does not rely on the detailed microphysics of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Correlators from Amplitubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the wavefunction coefficients for conformally coupled scalars in an FRW cosmology have been presented as a sum over amplitude-like functions known as {\it amplitubes}. In this work we extend this analysis to full {\it correlation functions}. Remarkably, the amplitube expansion of the correlator exhibits many vanishing contributions that are otherwise present in the expansion of the wavefunction. Moreover, while the wavefunction coefficients suffer from relative minus signs between terms, the surviving terms in correlation function do not. These observations point to a hidden simplicity in the structure of the correlation function compared to that of the wavefunction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Detecting Intermediate-mass Black Holes Using Miniature Pulsar Timing Arrays in Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical models predict that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) exist in globular clusters (GCs), but observational evidence remains elusive. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which are abundant in GCs and have served as precise probes for gravitational waves (GWs), offer a unique opportunity to detect potential IMBH binaries in GCs. Here, we consider the possibility of using multiple MSPs in a GC to form a miniature pulsar timing array (PTA), so as to take advantage of their correlated timing residuals to search for potential IMBH binaries in the same cluster. Our semi-analytical calculations reveal that nearby IMBH binaries around MSPs in GCs could induce microsecond-level timing residuals. In GCs like $\omega$ Centauri and M15, favorable configurations are found which could lead to the detection of binaries with mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.1$ and orbital periods of a few days. We estimate that future higher-precision timing programs could achieve $100$-nanosecond sensitivity, substantially expanding the searchable parameter space and establishing mini-PTAs as powerful detectors of IMBHs.</description>

      <title>Classical Fluid Analogies for Schr\"odinger-Newton Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson formalism has found a number of applications in cosmology, particularly in describing the growth by gravitational instability of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by ultra-light scalar particles. Here we investigate the extent to which the behaviour of this and the more general case of a Schr\"odinger-Newton system, can be described in terms of classical fluid concepts such as viscosity and pressure. We also explore whether such systems can be described by a pseudo-Reynolds number as for classical viscous fluids. The conclusion we reach is that this is indeed possible, but with important restrictions to ensure physical consistency.</description>
