      <title>Population dynamics of multiple ecDNA types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) can drive oncogene amplification, gene expression and intratumor heterogeneity, representing a major force in cancer initiation and progression. The phenomenon becomes even more intricate as distinct types of ecDNA present within a single cancer cell. While exciting as a new and significant observation across various cancer types, there is a lack of a general framework capturing the dynamics of multiple ecDNA types theoretically. Here, we present novel mathematical models investigating the proliferation and expansion of multiple ecDNA types in a growing cell population. By switching on and off a single parameter, we model different scenarios including ecDNA species with different oncogenes, genotypes with same oncogenes but different point mutations and phenotypes with identical genetic compositions but different functions. We analyse the fraction of ecDNA-positive and free cells as well as how the mean and variance of the copy number of cells carrying one or more ecDNA types change over time. Our results showed that switching does not play a role in the fraction and copy number distribution of total ecDNA-positive cells, if selection is identical among different ecDNA types. In addition, while cells with multiple ecDNA cannot be maintained in the scenario of ecDNA species without extra fitness advantages, they can persist and even dominate the ecDNA-positive population if switching is possible.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an LPAA model for Tribolium Growth: Insights into Population Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flour beetles (genus Tribolium) have long been used as a model organism to understand population dynamics in ecological research. A rich and rigorous body of work has cemented flour beetles' place in the field of mathematical biology. One of the most interesting results using flour beetles is the induction of chaos in a laboratory beetle population, in which the well-established LPA (larvae-pupae-adult) model was used to inform the experimental factors which would lead to chaos. However, whether chaos is an intrinsic property of flour beetles remains an open question. Inspired by new experimental data, we extend the LPA model by stratifying the adult population into newly emerged and mature adults and considering cannibalism as a function of mature adults. We fit the model to longitudinal data of larvae, pupae, and adult beetle populations to demonstrate the model's ability to recapitulate the transient dynamics of flour beetles. We present local and global stability results for the trivial and positive steady states and explore bifurcations and limit cycles numerically. Our results suggest that while chaos is a possibility, it is a rare phenomenon within realistic ranges of the parameters obtained from our experiment, and is likely induced by environmental changes connected to media changes and population censusing.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of macroscopic dynamics by fine-grained disorder in many-species ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large systems are often coarse-grained in order to study their low-dimensional macroscopic dynamics, yet microscopic complexity can in principle disrupt these predictions in many ways. We first consider one form of fine-grained complexity, heterogeneity in the time scales of microscopic dynamics, and show by an algebraic approach that it can stabilize macroscopic degrees of freedom. We then show that this time scale heterogeneity can arise from other forms of complexity, in particular disordered interactions between microscopic variables, and that it can drive the system's coarse-grained dynamics to transition from nonequilibrium attractors to fixed points. These mechanisms are demonstrated in a model of many-species ecosystems, where we find a quasi-decoupling between the low- and high-dimensional facets of the dynamics, interacting only through a key feature of ecological models, the fact that species' dynamical time scales are controlled by their abundances. We conclude that fine-grained disorder may enable a macroscopic equilibrium description of many-species ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Is there a robust effect of mainland mutualism rates on species richness of oceanic islands?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In island biogeography, it is widely accepted that species richness on island depends on the area and isolation of the island as well as the species pool on the mainland. Delavaux et al. (2024) suggest that species richness on oceanic islands also depends on the proportion of mutualists on the mainland, based on the idea that mutualists require specific interaction partners for their survival and thus have lower chances of establishment after successful immigration. As the proportion of mutualists increases towards the tropics, this effect could explain a weaker latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) for oceanic islands. However, after re-analyzing their data, we have doubts if these conclusions are supported by the available data.</description>

      <title>To Be a Truster or Not to Be: Evolutionary Dynamics of a Symmetric N-Player Trust Game in Well-Mixed and Networked Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust and reciprocation of it form the foundation of economic, social and other interactions. While the Trust Game is widely used to study these concepts for interactions between two players, often alternating different roles (i.e., investor and trustee), its extensions to multi-player scenarios have been restricted to instances where players assume only one role. We propose a symmetric N-player Trust Game, in which players alternate between two roles, and the payoff of the player is defined as the average across their two roles and drives the evolutionary game dynamics. We find that prosocial strategies are harder to evolve with the present symmetric N-player Trust Game than with the Public Goods Game, which is well studied. In particular, trust fails to evolve regardless of payoff function nonlinearity in well-mixed populations in the case of the symmetric N-player trust game. In structured populations, nonlinear payoffs can have strong impacts on the evolution of trust. The same nonlinearity can yield substantially different outcomes, depending on the nature of the underlying network. Our results highlight the importance of considering both payoff structures and network topologies in understanding the emergence and maintenance of prosocial behaviours.</description>

      <title>A universal niche geometry governs the response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How ecosystems respond to environmental perturbations is a fundamental question in ecology, made especially challenging due to the strong coupling between species and their environment. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for calculating the steady-state response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations in generalized consumer-resource. Our construction is applicable to a wide class of systems, including models with non-reciprocal interactions, cross-feeding, and non-linear growth/consumption rates. Within our framework, all ecological variables are embedded into four distinct vector spaces and ecological interactions are represented by geometric transformations between these spaces. We show that near a steady state, such geometric transformations directly map environmental perturbations - in resource availability and mortality rates - to shifts in niche structure. We illustrate these ideas in a variety of settings including a minimal model for pH-induced toxicity in bacterial denitrification. We end by discussing the biological implications of our framework. In particular, we show that it is extremely difficult to distinguish cooperative and competitive interactions by measuring species' responses to external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of automated labeling of specimen images datasets via a confidence-based process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The digitization of natural history collections over the past three decades has unlocked a treasure trove of specimen imagery and metadata. There is great interest in making this data more useful by further labeling it with additional trait data, and modern deep learning machine learning techniques utilizing convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and similar networks show particular promise to reduce the amount of required manual labeling by human experts, making the process much faster and less expensive. However, in most cases, the accuracy of these approaches is too low for reliable utilization of the automatic labeling, typically in the range of 80-85% accuracy. In this paper, we present and validate an approach that can greatly improve this accuracy, essentially by examining the confidence that the network has in the generated label as well as utilizing a user-defined threshold to reject labels that fall below a chosen level. We demonstrate that a naive model that produced 86% initial accuracy can achieve improved performance - over 95% accuracy (rejecting about 40% of the labels) or over 99% accuracy (rejecting about 65%) by selecting higher confidence thresholds. This gives flexibility to adapt existing models to the statistical requirements of various types of research and has the potential to move these automatic labeling approaches from being unusably inaccurate to being an invaluable new tool. After validating the approach in a number of ways, we annotate the reproductive state of a large dataset of over 600,000 herbarium specimens. The analysis of the results points at under-investigated correlations as well as general alignment with known trends. By sharing this new dataset alongside this work, we want to allow ecologists to gather insights for their own research questions, at their chosen point of accuracy/coverage trade-off.</description>
