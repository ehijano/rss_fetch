      <title>Protein-protein interaction networks can be highly sensitive to the membrane phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks take place in the fluid yet structured plasma membrane. Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been implicated in the functioning of various membrane-bound signaling processes. Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation framework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane criticality can lead to changes in the rate of interactions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic parameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions change the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains we term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting. More generally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes depend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior.</description>

      <title>The Demon Hidden Behind Life's Ultra-Energy-Efficient Information Processing -- Demonstrated by Biological Molecular Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has revealed the enormous energy demands of modern digital architectures, raising deep concerns about sustainability. In stark contrast, the human brain operates efficiently on only ~20 watts, and individual cells process gigabit-scale genetic information using energy on the order of trillionths of a watt. Under the same energy budget, a general-purpose digital processor can perform only a few simple operations per second. This striking disparity suggests that biological systems follow algorithms fundamentally distinct from conventional computation. The framework of information thermodynamics-especially Maxwell's demon and the Szilard engine-offers a theoretical clue, setting the lower bound of energy required for information processing. However, digital processors exceed this limit by about six orders of magnitude. Recent single-molecule studies have revealed that biological molecular motors convert Brownian motion into mechanical work, realizing a "demon-like" operational principle. These findings suggest that living systems have already implemented an ultra-efficient information-energy conversion mechanism that transcends digital computation. Here, we experimentally establish a quantitative correspondence between positional information (bits) and mechanical work, demonstrating that molecular machines selectively exploit rare but functional fluctuations arising from Brownian motion to achieve ATP-level energy efficiency. This integration of information, energy, and timescale indicates that life realizes a Maxwell's demon-like mechanism for energy-efficient information processing.</description>

      <title>Spatial organization of biomass controls intrinsic permeability of porous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biofilms in porous media critically influence hydraulic properties in environmental and engineered systems. However, a mechanistic understanding of how microbial life controls permeability remains elusive. By combining microfluidics, controlled pressure gradient and time-lapse microscopy, we quantify how motile and non-motile bacteria colonize a porous landscape and alter its resistance to flow. We find that while both strains achieve nearly identical total biomass, they cause drastically different permeability reductions - 78% for motile cells versus 94% for non-motile cells. This divergence stems from motility, which limits biomass spatial accumulation, whereas non-motile cells clog the entire system. We develop a mechanistic model that accurately predicts permeability dynamics from the pore-scale biomass distribution. We conclude that the spatial organization of biomass, not its total amount, is the primary factor controlling permeability.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High Dose-Rates, the FLASH Effect, and Hydrogen Peroxide Yields: Do Experiments and Simulations Really Disagree?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation chemistry of model systems irradiated with ultra-high dose-rates (UHDR) is key to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the sparing of healthy tissue, which is called the FLASH effect. It is envisioned to be used for efficient treatment of cancer by FLASH radiotherapy. However, it seems that even the most simple model systems, water irradiated with varying dose-rates (DR), pose a challenge. This became evident, as differences within measured and predicted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yields (g-values) for exposure of liquid samples to conventional DR and UHDR were reported. Many of the recently reported values contradict older experiments and current Monte-Carlo simulations(MCS). In the present work, we aim to identify possible reasons of these discrepancies and propose ways to overcome this issue. Hereby a short review of recent and classical literature concerning experimental and simulational studies is performed. The studies cover different radiation sources, from gamma rays, high-energy electrons, heavy particles (protons and ions) with low and high linear energy transfer (LET), and samples of hypoxic &amp; oxygenated water, with cosolutes such as bovine-serum albumine (BSA). Results are for additional experimental parameters, such as solvent, sample container and analysis methods used to determine the respective g-values of H2O2. Similarly the parameter of the MCS by the step-by-step approach, or the independent-reaction time (IRT) method are discussed. Here, UHDR induced modification of the radical-radical interaction and dynamics, not governed by diffusion processes, may cause problems. Approaches to test these different models are highlighted to allow progress: by making the step from a purely descriptive discourse of the effects observed, towards testable models, which should clarify the reasons of how and why such a disagreement came to light in the first place.</description>

      <title>Pregnancy as a dynamical paradox: robustness, control and birth onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The timing of human labor is among the most critical determinants of neonatal survival, yet the mechanisms that govern the transition from uterine quiescence to coordinated contractions remain elusive. Here we present a dynamical-systems framework that models the pregnant uterus as a spatially extended network of electrically excitable cells regulated by sparse adaptive feedback mimicking hormonal and mechanical influences. This approach reveals how stability during gestation and sensitivity near parturition can be simultaneously maintained through the interplay of control, network structure, and noise. Our analysis shows that spontaneous contractions such as Braxton-Hicks and Alvarez waves are not epiphenomena, but functional components that reduce control effort and preserve responsiveness. Moreover, we identify preterm labor as a boundary-crossing phenomenon arising when control fails to correctly interpret early-warning signals. These results establish a unifying mechanistic theory for labor onset, yield testable predictions, and suggest new therapeutic strategies to mitigate preterm birth risk.</description>
