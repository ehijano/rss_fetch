      <title>Path weighting sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the computation of sensitivities with respect to spot of path dependent financial derivatives by means of path weighting. We propose explicit path weighting formula and variance reduction adjustment in order to address the large variance happening when the first simulation time step is small. We also propose a covariance inflation technique to addresses the degenerator case when the covariance matrix is singular. The stock dynamics we consider is given in a general functional form, which includes the classical Black-Scholes model, the implied distribution model, and the local volatility model.</description>

      <title>The VIX as Stochastic Volatility for Corporate Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22498v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classic stochastic volatility models assume volatility is unobservable. We use the Volatility Index: S\&amp;P 500 VIX to observe it, to easier fit the model. We apply it to corporate bonds. We fit autoregression for corporate rates and for risk spreads between these rates and Treasury rates. Next, we divide residuals by VIX. Our main idea is such division makes residuals closer to the ideal case of a Gaussian white noise. This is remarkable, since these residuals and VIX come from separate market segments. Similarly, we model corporate bond returns as a linear function of rates and rate changes. Our article has two main parts: Moody's AAA and BAA spreads; Bank of America investment-grade and high-yield rates, spreads, and returns. We analyze long-term stability of these models.</description>

      <title>Zero-Coupon Treasury Yield Curve with VIX as Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multivariate autoregressive stochastic volatility model for the first 3 principal components (level, slope, curvature) of 10 series of zero-coupon Treasury bond rates with maturities from 1 to 10 years. We fit this model using monthly data from 1990. Next, we prove long-term stability for this discrete-time model and its continuous-time version. Unlike classic models with hidden stochastic volatility, here it is observed as VIX: the volatility index for the S\&amp;P 500 stock market index. It is surprising that this volatility, created for the stock market, also works for Treasury bonds. Since total returns of zero-coupon bonds can be easily found from these principal components, we prove long-term stability for total returns in discrete time.</description>
