      <title>GraphGarment: Learning Garment Dynamics for Bimanual Cloth Manipulation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05817v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical manipulation of garments is often crucial when performing fabric-related tasks, such as hanging garments. However, due to the deformable nature of fabrics, these operations remain a significant challenge for robots in household, healthcare, and industrial environments. In this paper, we propose GraphGarment, a novel approach that models garment dynamics based on robot control inputs and applies the learned dynamics model to facilitate garment manipulation tasks such as hanging. Specifically, we use graphs to represent the interactions between the robot end-effector and the garment. GraphGarment uses a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a dynamics model that can predict the next garment state given the current state and input action in simulation. To address the substantial sim-to-real gap, we propose a residual model that compensates for garment state prediction errors, thereby improving real-world performance. The garment dynamics model is then applied to a model-based action sampling strategy, where it is utilized to manipulate the garment to a reference pre-hanging configuration for garment-hanging tasks. We conducted four experiments using six types of garments to validate our approach in both simulation and real-world settings. In simulation experiments, GraphGarment achieves better garment state prediction performance, with a prediction error 0.46 cm lower than the best baseline. Our approach also demonstrates improved performance in the garment-hanging simulation experiment with enhancements of 12%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. Moreover, real-world robot experiments confirm the robustness of sim-to-real transfer, with an error increase of 0.17 cm compared to simulation results.

      <title>A Human-In-The-Loop Simulation Framework for Evaluating Control Strategies in Gait Assistive Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global population ages, effective rehabilitation and mobility aids will become increasingly critical. Gait assistive robots are promising solutions, but designing adaptable controllers for various impairments poses a significant challenge. This paper presented a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation framework tailored specifically for gait assistive robots, addressing unique challenges posed by passive support systems. We incorporated a realistic physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) model to enable a quantitative evaluation of robot control strategies, highlighting the performance of a speed-adaptive controller compared to a conventional PID controller in maintaining compliance and reducing gait distortion. We assessed the accuracy of the simulated interactions against that of the real-world data and revealed discrepancies in the adaptation strategies taken by the human and their effect on the human's gait. This work underscored the potential of HITL simulation as a versatile tool for developing and fine-tuning personalized control policies for various users.</description>

      <title>Refined Policy Distillation: From VLA Generalists to RL Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generalist Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can perform a variety of tasks on real robots with remarkable generalization capabilities. However, reported success rates are often not on par with those of expert policies. Moreover, VLAs usually do not work out of the box and often must be fine-tuned as they are sensitive to setup changes. In this work, we present Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), an RL-based policy refinement method that enables the distillation of large generalist models into small, high-performing expert policies. The student policy is guided during the RL exploration by actions of a teacher VLA for increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. Different from previous work that focuses on applying VLAs to real-world experiments, we create fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill2 to evaluate RPD in simulation. As our results for different manipulation tasks demonstrate, RPD enables the RL agent to learn expert policies that surpass the teacher's performance in both dense and sparse reward settings. Our approach is even robust to changes in the camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve.</description>

      <title>Merry-Go-Round: Safe Control of Decentralized Multi-Robot Systems with Deadlock Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach for decentralized multi-robot navigation that ensures both safety and deadlock prevention. Building on a standard control formulation, we add a lightweight deadlock prevention mechanism by forming temporary "roundabouts" (circular reference paths). Each robot relies only on local, peer-to-peer communication and a controller for base collision avoidance; a roundabout is generated or joined on demand to avert deadlocks. Robots in the roundabout travel in one direction until an escape condition is met, allowing them to return to goal-oriented motion. Unlike classical decentralized methods that lack explicit deadlock resolution, our roundabout maneuver ensures system-wide forward progress while preserving safety constraints. Extensive simulations and physical robot experiments show that our method consistently outperforms or matches the success and arrival rates of other decentralized control approaches, particularly in cluttered or high-density scenarios, all with minimal centralized coordination.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Thin-Film Wafer Inspection With A Multi-Sensor Array And Robot Constraint Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film inspection on large-area substrates in coating manufacture remains a critical parameter to ensure product quality; however, extending the inspection process precisely over a large area presents major challenges, due to the limitations of the available inspection equipment. An additional manipulation problem arises when automating the inspection process, as the silicon wafer requires movement constraints to ensure accurate measurements and to prevent damage. Furthermore, there are other increasingly important large-area industrial applications, such as Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing where coating thickness inspection introduces additional challenges. This paper presents an autonomous inspection system using a robotic manipulator with a novel learned constraint manifold to control a wafer to its calibration point, and a novel multi-sensor array with high potential for scalability into large substrate areas. We demonstrate that the manipulator can perform required motions whilst adhering to movement constraints. We further demonstrate that the sensor array can perform thickness measurements statically with an error of $&lt;2\%$ compared to a commercial reflectometer, and through the use of a manipulator can dynamically detect angle variations $&gt;0.5^\circ$ from the calibration point whilst monitoring the RMSE and $R^2$ over 1406 data points. These features are potentially useful for detecting displacement variations in R2R manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>MatchMaker: Automated Asset Generation for Robotic Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic assembly remains a significant challenge due to complexities in visual perception, functional grasping, contact-rich manipulation, and performing high-precision tasks. Simulation-based learning and sim-to-real transfer have led to recent success in solving assembly tasks in the presence of object pose variation, perception noise, and control error; however, the development of a generalist (i.e., multi-task) agent for a broad range of assembly tasks has been limited by the need to manually curate assembly assets, which greatly constrains the number and diversity of assembly problems that can be used for policy learning. Inspired by recent success of using generative AI to scale up robot learning, we propose MatchMaker, a pipeline to automatically generate diverse, simulation-compatible assembly asset pairs to facilitate learning assembly skills. Specifically, MatchMaker can 1) take a simulation-incompatible, interpenetrating asset pair as input, and automatically convert it into a simulation-compatible, interpenetration-free pair, 2) take an arbitrary single asset as input, and generate a geometrically-mating asset to create an asset pair, 3) automatically erode contact surfaces from (1) or (2) according to a user-specified clearance parameter to generate realistic parts. We demonstrate that data generated by MatchMaker outperforms previous work in terms of diversity and effectiveness for downstream assembly skill learning.

      <title>REACT: Multi Robot Energy-Aware Orchestrator for Indoor Search and Rescue Critical Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart factories enhance production efficiency and sustainability, but emergencies like human errors, machinery failures and natural disasters pose significant risks. In critical situations, such as fires or earthquakes, collaborative robots can assist first-responders by entering damaged buildings and locating missing persons, mitigating potential losses. Unlike previous solutions that overlook the critical aspect of energy management, in this paper we propose REACT, a smart energy-aware orchestrator that optimizes the exploration phase, ensuring prolonged operational time and effective area coverage. Our solution leverages a fleet of collaborative robots equipped with advanced sensors and communication capabilities to explore and navigate unknown indoor environments, such as smart factories affected by fires or earthquakes, with high density of obstacles. By leveraging real-time data exchange and cooperative algorithms, the robots dynamically adjust their paths, minimize redundant movements and reduce energy consumption. Extensive simulations confirm that our approach significantly improves the efficiency and reliability of search and rescue missions in complex indoor environments, improving the exploration rate by 10% over existing methods and reaching a map coverage of 97% under time critical operations, up to nearly 100% under relaxed time constraint.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Image Repair for Robust Visual Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based autonomous racing relies on accurate perception for robust control. However, image distribution changes caused by sensor noise, adverse weather, and dynamic lighting can degrade perception, leading to suboptimal control decisions. Existing approaches, including domain adaptation and adversarial training, improve robustness but struggle to generalize to unseen corruptions while introducing computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a real-time image repair module that restores corrupted images before they are used by the controller. Our method leverages generative adversarial models, specifically CycleGAN and pix2pix, for image repair. CycleGAN enables unpaired image-to-image translation to adapt to novel corruptions, while pix2pix exploits paired image data when available to improve the quality. To ensure alignment with control performance, we introduce a control-focused loss function that prioritizes perceptual consistency in repaired images. We evaluated our method in a simulated autonomous racing environment with various visual corruptions. The results show that our approach significantly improves performance compared to baselines, mitigating distribution shift and enhancing controller reliability.</description>

      <title>Universal Framework to Evaluate Automotive Perception Sensor Impact on Perception Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on automotive perception systems predominantly focusses on either improving the sensors for data quality or enhancing the performance of perception functions in isolation. Although automotive perception sensors form a fundamental part of the perception system, value addition in sensor data quality in isolation is questionable. However, the end goal for most perception systems is the accuracy of high-level functions such as trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles. High-level perception functions are increasingly based on deep learning (DL) models due to their improved performance and generalisability compared to traditional algorithms. Innately, DL models develop a performance bias on the comprehensiveness of the training data. Despite the vital need to evaluate the performance of DL-based perception functions under real-world conditions using onboard sensor inputs, there is a lack of frameworks to facilitate systematic evaluations. This paper presents a versatile and cost-effective framework to evaluate the impact of perception sensor modalities and parameter settings on DL-based perception functions. Using a simulation environment, the framework facilitates sensor modality testing and parameter tuning under different environmental conditions. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through a case study involving a state-of-the-art surround trajectory prediction model, highlighting performance differences across sensor modalities and recommending optimal parameter settings. The proposed framework offers valuable insights for designing the perception sensor suite, contributing to the development of robust perception systems for autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Rendering-based Pose Estimation for Surgical Robotic Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot pose estimation is a challenging and crucial task for vision-based surgical robotic automation. Typical robotic calibration approaches, however, are not applicable to surgical robots, such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), due to joint angle measurement errors from cable-drives and the partially visible kinematic chain. Hence, previous works in surgical robotic automation used tracking algorithms to estimate the pose of the surgical tool in real-time and compensate for the joint angle errors. However, a big limitation of these previous tracking works is the initialization step which relied on only keypoints and SolvePnP. In this work, we fully explore the potential of geometric primitives beyond just keypoints with differentiable rendering, cylinders, and construct a versatile pose matching pipeline in a novel pose hypothesis space. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our single-shot calibration method with both calibration consistency and real surgical tasks. As a result, this marker-less calibration approach proves to be a robust and generalizable initialization step for surgical tool tracking.</description>

      <title>Optimal sensor deception in stochastic environments with partial observability to mislead a robot to a decoy goal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deception is a common strategy adapted by autonomous systems in adversarial settings. Existing deception methods primarily focus on increasing opacity or misdirecting agents away from their goal or itinerary. In this work, we propose a deception problem aiming to mislead the robot towards a decoy goal through altering sensor events under a constrained budget of alteration. The environment along with the robot's interaction with it is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and the robot's action selection is governed by a Finite State Controller (FSC). Given a constrained budget for sensor event modifications, the objective is to compute a sensor alteration that maximizes the probability of the robot reaching a decoy goal. We establish the computational hardness of the problem by a reduction from the $0/1$ Knapsack problem and propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to compute optimal deception strategies. We show the efficacy of our MILP formulation via a sequence of experiments.</description>

      <title>ReJSHand: Efficient Real-Time Hand Pose Estimation and Mesh Reconstruction Using Refined Joint and Skeleton Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate hand pose estimation is vital in robotics, advancing dexterous manipulation in human-computer interaction. Toward this goal, this paper presents ReJSHand (which stands for Refined Joint and Skeleton Features), a cutting-edge network formulated for real-time hand pose estimation and mesh reconstruction. The proposed framework is designed to accurately predict 3D hand gestures under real-time constraints, which is essential for systems that demand agile and responsive hand motion tracking. The network's design prioritizes computational efficiency without compromising accuracy, a prerequisite for instantaneous robotic interactions. Specifically, ReJSHand comprises a 2D keypoint generator, a 3D keypoint generator, an expansion block, and a feature interaction block for meticulously reconstructing 3D hand poses from 2D imagery. In addition, the multi-head self-attention mechanism and a coordinate attention layer enhance feature representation, streamlining the creation of hand mesh vertices through sophisticated feature mapping and linear transformation. Regarding performance, comprehensive evaluations on the FreiHand dataset demonstrate ReJSHand's computational prowess. It achieves a frame rate of 72 frames per second while maintaining a PA-MPJPE (Position-Accurate Mean Per Joint Position Error) of 6.3 mm and a PA-MPVPE (Position-Accurate Mean Per Vertex Position Error) of 6.4 mm. Moreover, our model reaches scores of 0.756 for F@05 and 0.984 for F@15, surpassing modern pipelines and solidifying its position at the forefront of robotic hand pose estimators. To facilitate future studies, we provide our source code at ~\url{https://github.com/daishipeng/ReJSHand}.</description>

      <title>Learning to Drive by Imitating Surrounding Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising approach for training autonomous vehicles (AV) to navigate complex traffic environments by mimicking expert driver behaviors. However, a major challenge in this paradigm lies in effectively utilizing available driving data, as collecting new data is resource-intensive and often limited in its ability to cover diverse driving scenarios. While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation strategy that enhances imitation learning by leveraging the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured through the AV's sensors, as additional expert demonstrations. We introduce a vehicle selection sampling strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer and more diverse dataset for training. We evaluate our approach using the state-of-the-art learning-based planning method PLUTO on the nuPlan dataset and demonstrate that our augmentation method leads to improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, our method reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10% of the original dataset, our method achieves performance comparable to that of the full dataset, with improved collision rates. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>InfoFusion Controller: Informed TRRT Star with Mutual Information based on Fusion of Pure Pursuit and MPC for Enhanced Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the InfoFusion Controller, an advanced path planning algorithm that integrates both global and local planning strategies to enhance autonomous driving in complex urban environments. The global planner utilizes the informed Theta-Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (Informed-TRRT*) algorithm to generate an optimal reference path, while the local planner combines Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Pure Pursuit algorithms. Mutual Information (MI) is employed to fuse the outputs of the MPC and Pure Pursuit controllers, effectively balancing their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses. The proposed method addresses the challenges of navigating in dynamic environments with unpredictable obstacles by reducing uncertainty in local path planning and improving dynamic obstacle avoidance capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the InfoFusion Controller outperforms traditional methods in terms of safety, stability, and efficiency across various scenarios, including complex maps generated using SLAM techniques.

      <title>Zero-Shot Peg Insertion: Identifying Mating Holes and Estimating SE(2) Poses with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving zero-shot peg insertion, where inserting an arbitrary peg into an unseen hole without task-specific training, remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. This task demands a highly generalizable perception system capable of detecting potential holes, selecting the correct mating hole from multiple candidates, estimating its precise pose, and executing insertion despite uncertainties. While learning-based methods have been applied to peg insertion, they often fail to generalize beyond the specific peg-hole pairs encountered during training. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging large-scale datasets to enable robust generalization across diverse tasks. Inspired by their success, we introduce a novel zero-shot peg insertion framework that utilizes a VLM to identify mating holes and estimate their poses without prior knowledge of their geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 90.2% accuracy, significantly outperforming baselines in identifying the correct mating hole across a wide range of previously unseen peg-hole pairs, including 3D-printed objects, toy puzzles, and industrial connectors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real-world connector insertion task on a backpanel of a PC, where our system successfully detects holes, identifies the correct mating hole, estimates its pose, and completes the insertion with a success rate of 88.3%. These results highlight the potential of VLM-driven zero-shot reasoning for enabling robust and generalizable robotic assembly.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Motion Planner for Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an online motion planner for legged robot locomotion with the primary objective of achieving energy efficiency. The conceptual idea is to leverage a placement set of footstep positions based on the robot's body position to determine when and how to execute steps. In particular, the proposed planner uses virtual placement sets beneath the hip joints of the legs and executes a step when the foot is outside of such placement set. Furthermore, we propose a parameter design framework that considers both energy-efficiency and robustness measures to optimize the gait by changing the shape of the placement set along with other parameters, such as step height and swing time, as a function of walking speed. We show that the planner produces trajectories that have a low Cost of Transport (CoT) and high robustness measure, and evaluate our approach against model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) and motion imitation using biological dog motion priors as the reference. Overall, within low to medium velocity range, we show a 50.4% improvement in CoT and improved robustness over model-free RL, our best performing baseline. Finally, we show ability to handle slippery surfaces, gait transitions, and disturbances in simulation and hardware with the Unitree A1 robot.</description>

      <title>STAR: A Foundation Model-driven Framework for Robust Task Planning and Failure Recovery in Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern robotic systems, deployed across domains from industrial automation to domestic assistance, face a critical challenge: executing tasks with precision and adaptability in dynamic, unpredictable environments. To address this, we propose STAR (Smart Task Adaptation and Recovery), a novel framework that synergizes Foundation Models (FMs) with dynamically expanding Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable resilient task planning and autonomous failure recovery. While FMs offer remarkable generalization and contextual reasoning, their limitations, including computational inefficiency, hallucinations, and output inconsistencies hinder reliable deployment. STAR mitigates these issues by embedding learned knowledge into structured, reusable KGs, which streamline information retrieval, reduce redundant FM computations, and provide precise, scenario-specific insights. The framework leverages FM-driven reasoning to diagnose failures, generate context-aware recovery strategies, and execute corrective actions without human intervention or system restarts. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on rigid protocols, STAR dynamically expands its KG with experiential knowledge, ensuring continuous adaptation to novel scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we developed a comprehensive dataset that includes various robotic tasks and failure scenarios. Through extensive experimentation, STAR demonstrated an 86% task planning accuracy and 78% recovery success rate, showing significant improvements over baseline methods. The framework's ability to continuously learn from experience while maintaining structured knowledge representation makes it particularly suitable for long-term deployment in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>FSDP: Fast and Safe Data-Driven Overtaking Trajectory Planning for Head-to-Head Autonomous Racing Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating overtaking trajectories in autonomous racing is a challenging task, as the trajectory must satisfy the vehicle's dynamics and ensure safety and real-time performance running on resource-constrained hardware. This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

      <title>T-CBF: Traversability-based Control Barrier Function to Navigate Vertically Challenging Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety has been of paramount importance in motion planning and control techniques and is an active area of research in the past few years. Most safety research for mobile robots target at maintaining safety with the notion of collision avoidance. However, safety goes beyond just avoiding collisions, especially when robots have to navigate unstructured, vertically challenging, off-road terrain, where vehicle rollover and immobilization is as critical as collisions. In this work, we introduce a novel Traversability-based Control Barrier Function (T-CBF), in which we use neural Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to achieve safety beyond collision avoidance on unstructured vertically challenging terrain by reasoning about new safety aspects in terms of traversability. The neural T-CBF trained on safe and unsafe observations specific to traversability safety is then used to generate safe trajectories. Furthermore, we present experimental results in simulation and on a physical Verti-4 Wheeler (V4W) platform, demonstrating that T-CBF can provide traversability safety while reaching the goal position. T-CBF planner outperforms previously developed planners by 30\% in terms of keeping the robot safe and mobile when navigating on real world vertically challenging terrain.</description>

      <title>FlowMP: Learning Motion Fields for Robot Planning with Conditional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior flow matching methods in robotics have primarily learned velocity fields to morph one distribution of trajectories into another. In this work, we extend flow matching to capture second-order trajectory dynamics, incorporating acceleration effects either explicitly in the model or implicitly through the learning objective. Unlike diffusion models, which rely on a noisy forward process and iterative denoising steps, flow matching trains a continuous transformation (flow) that directly maps a simple prior distribution to the target trajectory distribution without any denoising procedure. By modeling trajectories with second-order dynamics, our approach ensures that generated robot motions are smooth and physically executable, avoiding the jerky or dynamically infeasible trajectories that first-order models might produce. We empirically demonstrate that this second-order conditional flow matching yields superior performance on motion planning benchmarks, achieving smoother trajectories and higher success rates than baseline planners. These findings highlight the advantage of learning acceleration-aware motion fields, as our method outperforms existing motion planning methods in terms of trajectory quality and planning success.</description>

      <title>GAT-Grasp: Gesture-Driven Affordance Transfer for Task-Aware Robotic Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise and generalizable grasping across diverse objects and environments is essential for intelligent and collaborative robotic systems. However, existing approaches often struggle with ambiguous affordance reasoning and limited adaptability to unseen objects, leading to suboptimal grasp execution. In this work, we propose GAT-Grasp, a gesture-driven grasping framework that directly utilizes human hand gestures to guide the generation of task-specific grasp poses with appropriate positioning and orientation. Specifically, we introduce a retrieval-based affordance transfer paradigm, leveraging the implicit correlation between hand gestures and object affordances to extract grasping knowledge from large-scale human-object interaction videos. By eliminating the reliance on pre-given object priors, GAT-Grasp enables zero-shot generalization to novel objects and cluttered environments. Real-world evaluations confirm its robustness across diverse and unseen scenarios, demonstrating reliable grasp execution in complex task settings.</description>

      <title>A Noise-Robust Turn-Taking System for Real-World Dialogue Robots: A Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turn-taking is a crucial aspect of human-robot interaction, directly influencing conversational fluidity and user engagement. While previous research has explored turn-taking models in controlled environments, their robustness in real-world settings remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a noise-robust voice activity projection (VAP) model, based on a Transformer architecture, to enhance real-time turn-taking in dialogue robots. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted a field experiment in a shopping mall, comparing the VAP system with a conventional cloud-based speech recognition system. Our analysis covered both subjective user evaluations and objective behavioral analysis. The results showed that the proposed system significantly reduced response latency, leading to a more natural conversation where both the robot and users responded faster. The subjective evaluations suggested that faster responses contribute to a better interaction experience.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework designed to tackle a range of planning problems arise in manipulation, which typically involve complex geometric-physical reasoning related to contact and dynamic constraints. We introduce the Contact Factor Graph (CFG) to graphically model these diverse factors, enabling us to perform inference on the graphs to approximate the distribution and sample appropriate solutions. We propose a novel approach that can incorporate various phenomena of contact manipulation as differentiable factors, and develop an efficient inference algorithm for CFG that leverages this differentiability along with the conditional probabilities arising from the structured nature of contact. Our results demonstrate the capability of our framework in generating viable samples and approximating posterior distributions for various manipulation scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rising demand for flexible manufacturing, robots are increasingly expected to operate in dynamic environments where local -- such as slight offsets or size differences in workpieces -- are common. We propose to address the problem of adapting robot behaviors to these task variations with a sample-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning approach adapting Behavior Tree (BT)-based policies. We maintain the core BT properties as an interpretable, modular framework for structuring reactive behaviors, but extend their use beyond static tasks by inherently accommodating local task variations. To show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments both in simulation and on a Franka Emika Panda 7-DoF, with the manipulator adapting to different obstacle avoidance and pivoting tasks.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control for Magnetic Micro-robot Navigation with Immersive Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic micro-robots have demonstrated immense potential in biomedical applications, such as in vivo drug delivery, non-invasive diagnostics, and cell-based therapies, owing to their precise maneuverability and small size. However, current micromanipulation techniques often rely solely on a two-dimensional (2D) microscopic view as sensory feedback, while traditional control interfaces do not provide an intuitive manner for operators to manipulate micro-robots. These limitations increase the cognitive load on operators, who must interpret limited feedback and translate it into effective control actions. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control (DRL-SC) framework for magnetic micro-robot navigation in a simulated microvascular system. Our framework integrates Mixed Reality (MR) to facilitate immersive manipulation of micro-robots, thereby enhancing situational awareness and control precision. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves navigation efficiency, reduces control errors, and enhances the overall robustness of the system in simulated microvascular environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an optimization-based motion planning methodology for snake robots operating in constrained environments. By using a reduced-order model, the proposed approach simplifies the planning process, enabling the optimizer to autonomously generate gaits while constraining the robot's footprint within tight spaces. The method is validated through high-fidelity simulations that accurately model contact dynamics and the robot's motion. Key locomotion strategies are identified and further demonstrated through hardware experiments, including successful navigation through narrow corridors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAV-capturing-MAV (MCM) is one of the few effective methods for physically countering misused or malicious MAVs.This paper presents a vision-based cooperative MCM system, where multiple pursuer MAVs equipped with onboard vision systems detect, localize, and pursue a target MAV. To enhance robustness, a distributed state estimation and control framework enables the pursuer MAVs to autonomously coordinate their actions. Pursuer trajectories are optimized using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and executed via a low-level SO(3) controller, ensuring smooth and stable pursuit. Once the capture conditions are satisfied, the pursuer MAVs automatically deploy a flying net to intercept the target. These capture conditions are determined based on the predicted motion of the net. To enable real-time decision-making, we propose a lightweight computational method to approximate the net motion, avoiding the prohibitive cost of solving the full net dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated through simulations and real-world experiments. In real-world tests, our approach successfully captures a moving target traveling at 4 meters per second with an acceleration of 1 meter per square second, achieving a success rate of 64.7 percent.</description>

      <title>Abdominal Undulation with Compliant Mechanism Improves Flight Performance of Biomimetic Robotic Butterfly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abdominal Undulation with Compliant Mechanism Improves Flight Performance of Biomimetic Robotic ButterflThis paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a biomimetic robotic butterfly (BRB) that integrates a compliant mechanism to achieve coupled wing-abdomen motion. Drawing inspiration from the natural f light dynamics of butterflies, a theoretical model is developed to investigate the impact of abdominal undulation on flight performance. To validate the model, motion capture experi ments are conducted on three configurations: a BRB without an abdomen, with a fixed abdomen, and with an undulating abdomen. The results demonstrate that abdominal undulation enhances lift generation, extends flight duration, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby improving overall flight performance. These findings underscore the significance of wing-abdomen interaction in flapping-wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs) and lay the groundwork for future advancements in energy-efficient biomimetic flight designs.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium MAV-Capture-MAV via Time-Optimal Planning and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capture of flying MAVs (micro aerial vehicles) has garnered increasing research attention due to its intriguing challenges and promising applications. Despite recent advancements, a key limitation of existing work is that capture strategies are often relatively simple and constrained by platform performance. This paper addresses control strategies capable of capturing high-maneuverability targets. The unique challenge of achieving target capture under unstable conditions distinguishes this task from traditional pursuit-evasion and guidance problems. In this study, we transition from larger MAV platforms to a specially designed, compact capture MAV equipped with a custom launching device while maintaining high maneuverability. We explore both time-optimal planning (TOP) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Simulations demonstrate that TOP offers highly maneuverable and shorter trajectories, while RL excels in real-time adaptability and stability. Moreover, the RL method has been tested in real-world scenarios, successfully achieving target capture even in unstable states.</description>

      <title>AgiBot World Colosseo: A Large-scale Manipulation Platform for Scalable and Intelligent Embodied Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how scalable robot data can address real-world challenges for generalized robotic manipulation. Introducing AgiBot World, a large-scale platform comprising over 1 million trajectories across 217 tasks in five deployment scenarios, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in data scale compared to existing datasets. Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution. It is extensible from grippers to dexterous hands and visuo-tactile sensors for fine-grained skill acquisition. Building on top of data, we introduce Genie Operator-1 (GO-1), a novel generalist policy that leverages latent action representations to maximize data utilization, demonstrating predictable performance scaling with increased data volume. Policies pre-trained on our dataset achieve an average performance improvement of 30% over those trained on Open X-Embodiment, both in in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. GO-1 exhibits exceptional capability in real-world dexterous and long-horizon tasks, achieving over 60% success rate on complex tasks and outperforming prior RDT approach by 32%. By open-sourcing the dataset, tools, and models, we aim to democratize access to large-scale, high-quality robot data, advancing the pursuit of scalable and general-purpose intelligence.</description>

      <title>Embodied multi-modal sensing with a soft modular arm powered by physical reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots have become increasingly popular for complex manipulation tasks requiring gentle and safe contact. However, their softness makes accurate control challenging, and high-fidelity sensing is a prerequisite to adequate control performance. To this end, many flexible and embedded sensors have been created over the past decade, but they inevitably increase the robot's complexity and stiffness. This study demonstrates a novel approach that uses simple bending strain gauges embedded inside a modular arm to extract complex information regarding its deformation and working conditions. The core idea is based on physical reservoir computing (PRC): A soft body's rich nonlinear dynamic responses, captured by the inter-connected bending sensor network, could be utilized for complex multi-modal sensing with a simple linear regression algorithm. Our results show that the soft modular arm reservoir can accurately predict body posture (bending angle), estimate payload weight, determine payload orientation, and even differentiate two payloads with only minimal difference in weight -- all using minimal digital computing power.</description>

      <title>Safe, Task-Consistent Manipulation with Operational Space Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe real-time control of robotic manipulators in unstructured environments requires handling numerous safety constraints without compromising task performance. Traditional approaches, such as artificial potential fields (APFs), suffer from local minima, oscillations, and limited scalability, while model predictive control (MPC) can be computationally expensive. Control barrier functions (CBFs) offer a promising alternative due to their high level of robustness and low computational cost, but these safety filters must be carefully designed to avoid significant reductions in the overall performance of the manipulator. In this work, we introduce an Operational Space Control Barrier Function (OSCBF) framework that integrates safety constraints while preserving task-consistent behavior. Our approach scales to hundreds of simultaneous constraints while retaining real-time control rates, ensuring collision avoidance, singularity prevention, and workspace containment even in highly cluttered and dynamic settings. By explicitly accounting for the task hierarchy in the CBF objective, we prevent degraded performance across both joint-space and operational-space tasks, when at the limit of safety. Our open-source, high-performance software will be available at our project webpage, https://stanfordasl.github.io/oscbf/</description>

      <title>pRRTC: GPU-Parallel RRT-Connect for Fast, Consistent, and Low-Cost Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning algorithms, like the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) and its widely used variant, RRT-Connect, provide efficient solutions for high-dimensional planning problems faced by real-world robots. However, these methods remain computationally intensive, particularly in complex environments that require many collision checks. As such, to improve performance, recent efforts have explored parallelizing specific components of RRT, such as collision checking or running multiple planners independently, but no prior work has integrated parallelism at multiple levels of the algorithm for robotic manipulation. In this work, we present pRRTC, a GPU-accelerated implementation of RRT-Connect that achieves parallelism across the entire algorithm through multithreaded expansion and connection, SIMT-optimized collision checking, and hierarchical parallelism optimization, improving efficiency, consistency, and initial solution cost. We evaluate the effectiveness of pRRTC on the MotionBenchMaker dataset using robots with 7, 8, and 14 degrees-of-freedom, demonstrating up to 6x average speedup on constrained reaching tasks at high collision checking resolution compared to state-of-the-art. pRRTC also demonstrates a 5x reduction in solution time variance and 1.5x improvement in initial path costs compared to state-of-the-art motion planners in complex environments across all robots.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Connectivity for Networked Robotics with Generative AI and Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of robotics, advanced communication networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of transforming industries through fully automated and intelligent operations. In this work, we introduce a novel co-working framework for robots that unifies goal-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) with a Generative AI (GenAI)-agent under a semantic-aware network. SemCom prioritizes the exchange of meaningful information among robots and the network, thereby reducing overhead and latency. Meanwhile, the GenAI-agent leverages generative AI models to interpret high-level task instructions, allocate resources, and adapt to dynamic changes in both network and robotic environments. This agent-driven paradigm ushers in a new level of autonomy and intelligence, enabling complex tasks of networked robots to be conducted with minimal human intervention. We validate our approach through a multi-robot anomaly detection use-case simulation, where robots detect, compress, and transmit relevant information for classification. Simulation results confirm that SemCom significantly reduces data traffic while preserving critical semantic details, and the GenAI-agent ensures task coordination and network adaptation. This synergy provides a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for modern industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Chance-constrained Linear Quadratic Gaussian Games for Multi-robot Interaction under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address safe multi-robot interaction under uncertainty. In particular, we formulate a chance-constrained linear quadratic Gaussian game with coupling constraints and system uncertainties. We find a tractable reformulation of the game and propose a dual ascent algorithm. We prove that the algorithm converges to a generalized Nash equilibrium of the reformulated game, ensuring the satisfaction of the chance constraints. We test our method in driving simulations and real-world robot experiments. Our method ensures safety under uncertainty and generates less conservative trajectories than single-agent model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Trajectory Planning with Multimodal Environmental Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle safe trajectory planning under Gaussian mixture model (GMM) uncertainty. Specifically, we use a GMM to model the multimodal behaviors of obstacles' uncertain states. Then, we develop a mixed-integer conic approximation to the chance-constrained trajectory planning problem with deterministic linear systems and polyhedral obstacles. When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments. We verify our methods with state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms and autonomous driving datasets.</description>

      <title>AutoMisty: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Automated Code Generation in the Misty Social Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html</description>

      <title>Robotic Ultrasound-Guided Femoral Artery Reconstruction of Anatomically-Representative Phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femoral artery access is essential for numerous clinical procedures, including diagnostic angiography, therapeutic catheterization, and emergency interventions. Despite its critical role, successful vascular access remains challenging due to anatomical variability, overlying adipose tissue, and the need for precise ultrasound (US) guidance. Errors in needle placement can lead to severe complications, restricting the procedure to highly skilled clinicians in controlled hospital settings. While robotic systems have shown promise in addressing these challenges through autonomous scanning and vessel reconstruction, clinical translation remains limited due to reliance on simplified phantom models that fail to capture human anatomical complexity. In this work, we present a method for autonomous robotic US scanning of bifurcated femoral arteries, and validate it on five vascular phantoms created from real patient computed tomography (CT) data. Additionally, we introduce a video-based deep learning US segmentation network tailored for vascular imaging, enabling improved 3D arterial reconstruction. The proposed network achieves a Dice score of 89.21% and an Intersection over Union of 80.54% on a newly developed vascular dataset. The quality of the reconstructed artery centerline is evaluated against ground truth CT data, demonstrating an average L2 deviation of 0.91+/-0.70 mm, with an average Hausdorff distance of 4.36+/-1.11mm. This study is the first to validate an autonomous robotic system for US scanning of the femoral artery on a diverse set of patient-specific phantoms, introducing a more advanced framework for evaluating robotic performance in vascular imaging and intervention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot design is a complex and time-consuming process that requires specialized expertise. Gaining a deeper understanding of robot design data can enable various applications, including automated design generation, retrieving example designs from text, and developing AI-powered design assistants. While recent advancements in foundation models present promising approaches to addressing these challenges, progress in this field is hindered by the lack of large-scale design datasets. In this paper, we introduce RoboDesign1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million samples. Our dataset features multimodal data collected from scientific literature, covering various robotics domains. We propose a semi-automated data collection pipeline, enabling efficient and diverse data acquisition. To assess the effectiveness of RoboDesign1M, we conduct extensive experiments across multiple tasks, including design image generation, visual question answering about designs, and design image retrieval. The results demonstrate that our dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark for design understanding tasks and has the potential to advance research in this field. RoboDesign1M will be released to support further developments in AI-driven robotic design automation.</description>

      <title>A Physically Consistent Stiffness Formulation for Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring symmetric stiffness in impedance-controlled robots is crucial for physically meaningful and stable interaction in contact-rich manipulation. Conventional approaches neglect the change of basis vectors in curved spaces, leading to an asymmetric joint-space stiffness matrix that violates passivity and conservation principles. In this work, we derive a physically consistent, symmetric joint-space stiffness formulation directly from the task-space stiffness matrix by explicitly incorporating Christoffel symbols. This correction resolves long-standing inconsistencies in stiffness modeling, ensuring energy conservation and stability. We validate our approach experimentally on a robotic system, demonstrating that omitting these correction terms results in significant asymmetric stiffness errors. Our findings bridge theoretical insights with practical control applications, offering a robust framework for stable and interpretable robotic interactions.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Generalization for Robotics via Modularity and Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we build generalist robot systems? Scale may not be enough due to the significant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and the challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed robotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent generalization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this thesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by integrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale learning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is: how can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key insight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level control end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more efficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in building generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast amounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source of supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source: classical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires access to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these planners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce generalist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with large-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of performing zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key ingredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control, procedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real transfer. We demonstrate that this recipe can produce a single, generalist agent that can solve challenging long-horizon manipulation tasks in the real world.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Dual-Arm Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce One-Shot Dual-Arm Imitation Learning (ODIL), which enables dual-arm robots to learn precise and coordinated everyday tasks from just a single demonstration of the task. ODIL uses a new three-stage visual servoing (3-VS) method for precise alignment between the end-effector and target object, after which replay of the demonstration trajectory is sufficient to perform the task. This is achieved without requiring prior task or object knowledge, or additional data collection and training following the single demonstration. Furthermore, we propose a new dual-arm coordination paradigm for learning dual-arm tasks from a single demonstration. ODIL was tested on a real-world dual-arm robot, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across six precise and coordinated tasks in both 4-DoF and 6-DoF settings, and showing robustness in the presence of distractor objects and partial occlusions.

      <title>A2I-Calib: An Anti-noise Active Multi-IMU Spatial-temporal Calibration Framework for Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multi-node inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based odometry for legged robots has gained attention due to its cost-effectiveness, power efficiency, and high accuracy. However, the spatial and temporal misalignment between foot-end motion derived from forward kinematics and foot IMU measurements can introduce inconsistent constraints, resulting in odometry drift. Therefore, accurate spatial-temporal calibration is crucial for the multi-IMU systems. Although existing multi-IMU calibration methods have addressed passive single-rigid-body sensor calibration, they are inadequate for legged systems. This is due to the insufficient excitation from traditional gaits for calibration, and enlarged sensitivity to IMU noise during kinematic chain transformations. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$I-Calib, an anti-noise active multi-IMU calibration framework enabling autonomous spatial-temporal calibration for arbitrary foot-mounted IMUs. Our A$^2$I-Calib includes: 1) an anti-noise trajectory generator leveraging a proposed basis function selection theorem to minimize the condition number in correlation analysis, thus reducing noise sensitivity, and 2) a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller that ensures robust execution of calibration motions. Furthermore, A$^2$I-Calib is validated on simulation and real-world quadruped robot platforms with various multi-IMU settings, which demonstrates a significant reduction in noise sensitivity and calibration errors, thereby improving the overall multi-IMU odometry performance.</description>

      <title>Eye-in-Finger: Smart Fingers for Delicate Assembly and Disassembly of LEGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulation and insertion of small and tight-toleranced objects in robotic assembly remain a critical challenge for vision-based robotics systems due to the required precision and cluttered environment. Conventional global or wrist-mounted cameras often suffer from occlusions when either assembling or disassembling from an existing structure. To address the challenge, this paper introduces "Eye-in-Finger", a novel tool design approach that enhances robotic manipulation by embedding low-cost, high-resolution perception directly at the tool tip. We validate our approach using LEGO assembly and disassembly tasks, which require the robot to manipulate in a cluttered environment and achieve sub-millimeter accuracy and robust error correction due to the tight tolerances. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system enables real-time, fine corrections to alignment error, increasing the tolerance of calibration error from 0.4mm to up to 2.0mm for the LEGO manipulation robot.</description>

      <title>HIF: Height Interval Filtering for Efficient Dynamic Points Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D point cloud mapping plays a essential role in localization and autonomous navigation. However, dynamic objects often leave residual traces during the map construction process, which undermine the performance of subsequent tasks. Therefore, dynamic object removal has become a critical challenge in point cloud based map construction within dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches, however, often incur significant computational overhead, making it difficult to meet the real-time processing requirements. To address this issue, we introduce the Height Interval Filtering (HIF) method. This approach constructs pillar-based height interval representations to probabilistically model the vertical dimension, with interval probabilities updated through Bayesian inference. It ensures real-time performance while achieving high accuracy and improving robustness in complex environments. Additionally, we propose a low-height preservation strategy that enhances the detection of unknown spaces, reducing misclassification in areas blocked by obstacles (occluded regions). Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that HIF delivers a 7.7 times improvement in time efficiency with comparable accuracy to existing SOTA methods. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Graphormer-Guided Task Planning: Beyond Static Rules with LLM Safety Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their role in robotic task planning. However, while LLMs have been explored for generating feasible task sequences, their ability to ensure safe task execution remains underdeveloped. Existing methods struggle with structured risk perception, making them inadequate for safety-critical applications where low-latency hazard adaptation is required. To address this limitation, we propose a Graphormer-enhanced risk-aware task planning framework that combines LLM-based decision-making with structured safety modeling. Our approach constructs a dynamic spatio-semantic safety graph, capturing spatial and contextual risk factors to enable online hazard detection and adaptive task refinement. Unlike existing methods that rely on predefined safety constraints, our framework introduces a context-aware risk perception module that continuously refines safety predictions based on real-time task execution. This enables a more flexible and scalable approach to robotic planning, allowing for adaptive safety compliance beyond static rules. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments in the AI2-THOR environment. The experiments results validates improvements in risk detection accuracy, rising safety notice, and task adaptability of our framework in continuous environments compared to static rule-based and LLM-only baselines.

      <title>Collective Behavior Clone with Visual Attention via Neural Interaction Graph Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework, collective behavioral cloning (CBC), to learn the underlying interaction mechanism and control policy of a swarm system. Given the trajectory data of a swarm system, we propose a graph variational autoencoder (GVAE) to learn the local interaction graph. Based on the interaction graph and swarm trajectory, we use behavioral cloning to learn the control policy of the swarm system. To demonstrate the practicality of CBC, we deploy it on a real-world decentralized vision-based robot swarm system. A visual attention network is trained based on the learned interaction graph for online neighbor selection. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches in predicting both the interaction graph and swarm actions with higher accuracy. This work offers a promising approach for understanding interaction mechanisms and swarm dynamics in future swarm robotics research. Code and data are available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm missions rely heavily on expensive custom-made drones with onboard perception or external positioning systems, limiting their widespread adoption in research and education. To address this issue, we propose AirSwarm. AirSwarm democratizes multi-drone coordination using low-cost commercially available drones such as Tello or Anafi, enabling affordable swarm aerial robotics research and education. Key innovations include a hierarchical control architecture for reliable multi-UAV coordination, an infrastructure-free visual SLAM system for precise localization without external motion capture, and a ROS-based software framework for simplified swarm development. Experiments demonstrate cm-level tracking accuracy, low-latency control, communication failure resistance, formation flight, and trajectory tracking. By reducing financial and technical barriers, AirSwarm makes multi-robot education and research more accessible. The complete instructions and open source code will be available at</description>

      <title>AKF-LIO: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry with Gaussian Map by Adaptive Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) systems typically use sensor-specific or environment-dependent measurement covariances during state estimation, leading to laborious parameter tuning and suboptimal performance in challenging conditions (e.g., sensor degeneracy and noisy observations). Therefore, we propose an Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) framework that dynamically estimates time-varying noise covariances of LiDAR and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, enabling context-aware confidence weighting between sensors. During LiDAR degeneracy, the system prioritizes IMU data while suppressing contributions from unreliable inputs like moving objects or noisy point clouds. Furthermore, a compact Gaussian-based map representation is introduced to model environmental planarity and spatial noise. A correlated registration strategy ensures accurate plane normal estimation via pseudo-merge, even in unstructured environments like forests. Extensive experiments validate the robustness of the proposed system across diverse environments, including dynamic scenes and geometrically degraded scenarios. Our method achieves reliable localization results across all MARS-LVIG sequences and ranks 8th on the KITTI Odometry Benchmark. The code will be released at https://github.com/xpxie/AKF-LIO.git.</description>

      <title>SafePlan: Leveraging Formal Logic and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Enhanced Safety in LLM-based Robotic Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotics researchers increasingly leverage large language models (LLM) in robotics systems, using them as interfaces to receive task commands, generate task plans, form team coalitions, and allocate tasks among multi-robot and human agents. However, despite their benefits, the growing adoption of LLM in robotics has raised several safety concerns, particularly regarding executing malicious or unsafe natural language prompts. In addition, ensuring that task plans, team formation, and task allocation outputs from LLMs are adequately examined, refined, or rejected is crucial for maintaining system integrity. In this paper, we introduce SafePlan, a multi-component framework that combines formal logic and chain-of-thought reasoners for enhancing the safety of LLM-based robotics systems. Using the components of SafePlan, including Prompt Sanity COT Reasoner and Invariant, Precondition, and Postcondition COT reasoners, we examined the safety of natural language task prompts, task plans, and task allocation outputs generated by LLM-based robotic systems as means of investigating and enhancing system safety profile. Our results show that SafePlan outperforms baseline models by leading to 90.5% reduction in harmful task prompt acceptance while still maintaining reasonable acceptance of safe tasks.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Quasi-Static FEM for Real-Time Modeling of Continuum Robots with Multiple Contacts and Large Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum robots offer high flexibility and multiple degrees of freedom, making them ideal for navigating narrow lumens. However, accurately modeling their behavior under large deformations and frequent environmental contacts remains challenging. Current methods for solving the deformation of these robots, such as the Model Order Reduction and Gauss-Seidel (GS) methods, suffer from significant drawbacks. They experience reduced computational speed as the number of contact points increases and struggle to balance speed with model accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel finite element method (FEM) named Acc-FEM. Acc-FEM employs a large deformation quasi-static finite element model and integrates an accelerated solver scheme to handle multi-contact simulations efficiently. Additionally, it utilizes parallel computing with Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for real-time updates of the finite element models and collision detection. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that Acc-FEM significantly improves computational efficiency in modeling continuum robots with multiple contacts while achieving satisfactory accuracy, addressing the deficiencies of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Handle Object Navigation as Weighted Traveling Repairman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON) requires agents to navigate to objects specified via open-ended natural language without predefined categories or prior environmental knowledge. While recent methods leverage foundation models or multi-modal maps, they often rely on 2D representations and greedy strategies or require additional training or modules with high computation load, limiting performance in complex environments and real applications. We propose WTRP-Searcher, a novel framework that formulates ZSON as a Weighted Traveling Repairman Problem (WTRP), minimizing the weighted waiting time of viewpoints. Using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), we score viewpoints based on object-description similarity, projected onto a 2D map with depth information. An open-vocabulary detector identifies targets, dynamically updating goals, while a 3D embedding feature map enhances spatial awareness and environmental recall. WTRP-Searcher outperforms existing methods, offering efficient global planning and improved performance in complex ZSON tasks. Code and more demos will be avaliable on https://github.com/lrm20011/WTRP_Searcher.</description>

      <title>MERLION: Marine ExploRation with Language guIded Online iNformative Visual Sampling and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous and targeted underwater visual monitoring and exploration using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can be a challenging task due to both online and offline constraints. The online constraints comprise limited onboard storage capacity and communication bandwidth to the surface, whereas the offline constraints entail the time and effort required for the selection of desired key frames from the video data. An example use case of targeted underwater visual monitoring is finding the most interesting visual frames of fish in a long sequence of an AUV's visual experience. This challenge of targeted informative sampling is further aggravated in murky waters with poor visibility. In this paper, we present MERLION, a novel framework that provides semantically aligned and visually enhanced summaries for murky underwater marine environment monitoring and exploration. Specifically, our framework integrates (a) an image-text model for semantically aligning the visual samples to the users' needs, (b) an image enhancement model for murky water visual data and (c) an informative sampler for summarizing the monitoring experience. We validate our proposed MERLION framework on real-world data with user studies and present qualitative and quantitative results using our evaluation metric and show improved results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We have open-sourced the code for MERLION at the following link https://github.com/MARVL-Lab/MERLION.git.</description>

      <title>Parametric Value Approximation for General-sum Differential Games with State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-sum differential games can approximate values solved by Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations for efficient inference when information is incomplete. However, solving such games through conventional methods encounters the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a scalable approach to alleviate the CoD and approximate values, but there exist convergence issues for value approximations through vanilla PINNs when state constraints lead to values with large Lipschitz constants, particularly in safety-critical applications. In addition to addressing CoD, it is necessary to learn a generalizable value across a parametric space of games, rather than training multiple ones for each specific player-type configuration. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Hybrid Neural Operator (HNO), which is an operator that can map parameter functions for games to value functions. HNO leverages informative supervised data and samples PDE-driven data across entire spatial-temporal space for model refinement. We evaluate HNO on 9D and 13D scenarios with nonlinear dynamics and state constraints, comparing it against a Supervised Neural Operator (a variant of DeepONet). Under the same computational budget and training data, HNO outperforms SNO for safety performance. This work provides a step toward scalable and generalizable value function approximation, enabling real-time inference for complex human-robot or multi-agent interactions.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Network Predictive Control for Quadruped Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a unified control framework that addresses the challenge of precise quadruped locomotion with unknown payloads, named as online payload identification-based physics-informed neural network predictive control (OPI-PINNPC). By integrating online payload identification with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), our approach embeds identified mass parameters directly into the neural network's loss function, ensuring physical consistency while adapting to changing load conditions. The physics-constrained neural representation serves as an efficient surrogate model within our nonlinear model predictive controller, enabling real-time optimization despite the complex dynamics of legged locomotion. Experimental validation on our quadruped robot platform demonstrates 35% improvement in position and orientation tracking accuracy across diverse payload conditions (25-100 kg), with substantially faster convergence compared to previous adaptive control methods. Our framework provides a adaptive solution for maintaining locomotion performance under variable payload conditions without sacrificing computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>HELM: Human-Preferred Exploration with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous exploration tasks, robots are required to explore and map unknown environments while efficiently planning in dynamic and uncertain conditions. Given the significant variability of environments, human operators often have specific preference requirements for exploration, such as prioritizing certain areas or optimizing for different aspects of efficiency. However, existing methods struggle to accommodate these human preferences adaptively, often requiring extensive parameter tuning or network retraining. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been widely applied to text-based planning and complex reasoning, their potential for enhancing autonomous exploration is becoming increasingly promising. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM-based human-preferred exploration framework that seamlessly integrates a mobile robot system with LLMs. By leveraging the reasoning and adaptability of LLMs, our approach enables intuitive and flexible preference control through natural language while maintaining a task success rate comparable to state-of-the-art traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human intent and policy preference in autonomous exploration, offering a more user-friendly and adaptable solution for real-world robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Nash Equilibrial Hamiltonian for Two-Player Collision-Avoiding Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning Nash equilibrial policies for two-player risk-sensitive collision-avoiding interactions. Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations of such general-sum differential games in real time is an open challenge due to the discontinuity of equilibrium values on the state space. A common solution is to learn a neural network that approximates the equilibrium Hamiltonian for given system states and actions. The learning, however, is usually supervised and requires a large amount of sample equilibrium policies from different initial states in order to mitigate the risks of collisions. This paper claims two contributions towards more data-efficient learning of equilibrium policies: First, instead of computing Hamiltonian through a value network, we show that the equilibrium co-states have simple structures when collision avoidance dominates the agents' loss functions and system dynamics is linear, and therefore are more data-efficient to learn. Second, we introduce theory-driven active learning to guide data sampling, where the acquisition function measures the compliance of the predicted co-states to Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. On an uncontrolled intersection case, the proposed method leads to more generalizable approximation of the equilibrium policies, and in turn, lower collision probabilities, than the state-of-the-art under the same data acquisition budget.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your Robots? The Impact of Demonstration Modality on Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising approach for learning robot policies with user-provided data. The way demonstrations are provided, i.e., demonstration modality, influences the quality of the data. While existing research shows that kinesthetic teaching (physically guiding the robot) is preferred by users for the intuitiveness and ease of use, the majority of existing manipulation datasets were collected through teleoperation via a VR controller or spacemouse. In this work, we investigate how different demonstration modalities impact downstream learning performance as well as user experience. Specifically, we compare low-cost demonstration modalities including kinesthetic teaching, teleoperation with a VR controller, and teleoperation with a spacemouse controller. We experiment with three table-top manipulation tasks with different motion constraints. We evaluate and compare imitation learning performance using data from different demonstration modalities, and collected subjective feedback on user experience. Our results show that kinesthetic teaching is rated the most intuitive for controlling the robot and provides cleanest data for best downstream learning performance. However, it is not preferred as the way for large-scale data collection due to the physical load. Based on such insight, we propose a simple data collection scheme that relies on a small number of kinesthetic demonstrations mixed with data collected through teleoperation to achieve the best overall learning performance while maintaining low data-collection effort.</description>

      <title>Combating Partial Perception Deficit in Autonomous Driving with Multimodal LLM Commonsense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial perception deficits can compromise autonomous vehicle safety by disrupting environmental understanding. Current protocols typically respond with immediate stops or minimal-risk maneuvers, worsening traffic flow and lacking flexibility for rare driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose LLM-RCO, a framework leveraging large language models to integrate human-like driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO features four key modules: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action condition verifier, and safety constraint generator. These modules interact with the dynamic driving environment, enabling proactive and context-aware control actions to override the original control policy of autonomous agents. To improve safety in such challenging conditions, we construct DriveLM-Deficit, a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects, complete with annotations for LLM-based hazard inference and motion planning fine-tuning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA simulator demonstrate that systems equipped with LLM-RCO significantly improve driving performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous driving resilience against adverse perception deficits. Our results also show that LLMs fine-tuned with DriveLM-Deficit can enable more proactive movements instead of conservative stops in the context of perception deficits.</description>

      <title>VMTS: Vision-Assisted Teacher-Student Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Terrain Locomotion in Bipedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipedal robots, due to their anthropomorphic design, offer substantial potential across various applications, yet their control is hindered by the complexity of their structure. Currently, most research focuses on proprioception-based methods, which lack the capability to overcome complex terrain. While visual perception is vital for operation in human-centric environments, its integration complicates control further. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown promise in enhancing legged robot locomotion, particularly with proprioception-based methods. However, terrain adaptability, especially for bipedal robots, remains a significant challenge, with most research focusing on flat-terrain scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel mixture of experts teacher-student network RL strategy, which enhances the performance of teacher-student policies based on visual inputs through a simple yet effective approach. Our method combines terrain selection strategies with the teacher policy, resulting in superior performance compared to traditional models. Additionally, we introduce an alignment loss between the teacher and student networks, rather than enforcing strict similarity, to improve the student's ability to navigate diverse terrains. We validate our approach experimentally on the Limx Dynamic P1 bipedal robot, demonstrating its feasibility and robustness across multiple terrain types.</description>

      <title>RS2V-L: Vehicle-Mounted LiDAR Data Generation from Roadside Sensor Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving solutions, which process multi-modal sensory data to directly generate refined control commands, have become a dominant paradigm in autonomous driving research. However, these approaches predominantly depend on single-vehicle data collection for model training and optimization, resulting in significant challenges such as high data acquisition and annotation costs, the scarcity of critical driving scenarios, and fragmented datasets that impede model generalization. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce RS2V-L, a novel framework for reconstructing and synthesizing vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor observations. Specifically, our method transforms roadside LiDAR point clouds into the vehicle-mounted LiDAR coordinate system by leveraging the target vehicle's relative pose. Subsequently, high-fidelity vehicle-mounted LiDAR data is synthesized through virtual LiDAR modeling, point cloud classification, and resampling techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to reconstruct vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating the generated data into model training-complementing the KITTI dataset-enhances 3D object detection accuracy by over \text{30\%} while improving the efficiency of end-to-end autonomous driving data generation by more than an order of magnitude. These findings strongly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and underscore its potential in reducing dependence on costly vehicle-mounted data collection while improving the robustness of autonomous driving models.</description>

      <title>iManip: Skill-Incremental Learning for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of a generalist agent with adaptive multiple manipulation skills has been a long-standing goal in the robotics community. In this paper, we explore a crucial task, skill-incremental learning, in robotic manipulation, which is to endow the robots with the ability to learn new manipulation skills based on the previous learned knowledge without re-training. First, we build a skill-incremental environment based on the RLBench benchmark, and explore how traditional incremental methods perform in this setting. We find that they suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting due to the previous methods on classification overlooking the characteristics of temporality and action complexity in robotic manipulation tasks. Towards this end, we propose an incremental Manip}ulation framework, termed iManip, to mitigate the above issues. We firstly design a temporal replay strategy to maintain the integrity of old skills when learning new skill. Moreover, we propose the extendable PerceiverIO, consisting of an action prompt with extendable weight to adapt to new action primitives in new skill. Extensive experiments show that our framework performs well in Skill-Incremental Learning. Codes of the skill-incremental environment with our framework will be open-source.</description>

      <title>PoseLess: Depth-Free Vision-to-Joint Control via Direct Image Mapping with VLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07111v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces PoseLess, a novel framework for robot hand control that eliminates the need for explicit pose estimation by directly mapping 2D images to joint angles using projected representations. Our approach leverages synthetic training data generated through randomized joint configurations, enabling zero-shot generalization to real-world scenarios and cross-morphology transfer from robotic to human hands. By projecting visual inputs and employing a transformer-based decoder, PoseLess achieves robust, low-latency control while addressing challenges such as depth ambiguity and data scarcity. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance in joint angle prediction accuracy without relying on any human-labelled dataset.</description>

      <title>VidBot: Learning Generalizable 3D Actions from In-the-Wild 2D Human Videos for Zero-Shot Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future robots are envisioned as versatile systems capable of performing a variety of household tasks. The big question remains, how can we bridge the embodiment gap while minimizing physical robot learning, which fundamentally does not scale well. We argue that learning from in-the-wild human videos offers a promising solution for robotic manipulation tasks, as vast amounts of relevant data already exist on the internet. In this work, we present VidBot, a framework enabling zero-shot robotic manipulation using learned 3D affordance from in-the-wild monocular RGB-only human videos. VidBot leverages a pipeline to extract explicit representations from them, namely 3D hand trajectories from videos, combining a depth foundation model with structure-from-motion techniques to reconstruct temporally consistent, metric-scale 3D affordance representations agnostic to embodiments. We introduce a coarse-to-fine affordance learning model that first identifies coarse actions from the pixel space and then generates fine-grained interaction trajectories with a diffusion model, conditioned on coarse actions and guided by test-time constraints for context-aware interaction planning, enabling substantial generalization to novel scenes and embodiments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VidBot, which significantly outperforms counterparts across 13 manipulation tasks in zero-shot settings and can be seamlessly deployed across robot systems in real-world environments. VidBot paves the way for leveraging everyday human videos to make robot learning more scalable.</description>

      <title>Reactive and Safety-Aware Path Replanning for Collaborative Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses motion replanning in human-robot collaborative scenarios, emphasizing reactivity and safety-compliant efficiency. While existing human-aware motion planners are effective in structured environments, they often struggle with unpredictable human behavior, leading to safety measures that limit robot performance and throughput. In this study, we combine reactive path replanning and a safety-aware cost function, allowing the robot to adjust its path to changes in the human state. This solution reduces the execution time and the need for trajectory slowdowns without sacrificing safety. Simulations and real-world experiments show the method's effectiveness compared to standard human-robot cooperation approaches, with efficiency enhancements of up to 60\%.</description>

      <title>Discrete Gaussian Process Representations for Optimising UAV-based Precision Weed Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate agricultural weed mapping using UAVs is crucial for precision farming applications. Traditional methods rely on orthomosaic stitching from rigid flight paths, which is computationally intensive and time-consuming. Gaussian Process (GP)-based mapping offers continuous modelling of the underlying variable (i.e. weed distribution) but requires discretisation for practical tasks like path planning or visualisation. Current implementations often default to quadtrees or gridmaps without systematically evaluating alternatives. This study compares five discretisation methods: quadtrees, wedgelets, top-down binary space partition (BSP) trees using least square error (LSE), bottom-up BSP trees using graph merging, and variable-resolution hexagonal grids. Evaluations on real-world weed distributions measure visual similarity, mean squared error (MSE), and computational efficiency. Results show quadtrees perform best overall, but alternatives excel in specific scenarios: hexagons or BSP LSE suit fields with large, dominant weed patches, while quadtrees are optimal for dispersed small-scale distributions. These findings highlight the need to tailor discretisation approaches to weed distribution patterns (patch size, density, coverage) rather than relying on default methods. By choosing representations based on the underlying distribution, we can improve mapping accuracy and efficiency for precision agriculture applications.</description>

      <title>Learning and planning for optimal synergistic human-robot coordination in manufacturing contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative robotics cells leverage heterogeneous agents to provide agile production solutions. Effective coordination is essential to prevent inefficiencies and risks for human operators working alongside robots. This paper proposes a human-aware task allocation and scheduling model based on Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming to optimize efficiency and safety starting from task planning stages. The approach exploits synergies that encode the coupling effects between pairs of tasks executed in parallel by the agents, arising from the safety constraints imposed on robot agents. These terms are learned from previous executions using a Bayesian estimation; the inference of the posterior probability distribution of the synergy coefficients is performed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The synergy enhances task planning by adapting the nominal duration of the plan according to the effect of the operator's presence. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces improved human-aware task plans, reducing unuseful interference between agents, increasing human-robot distance, and achieving up to an 18\% reduction in process execution time.</description>

      <title>WHERE-Bot: a Wheel-less Helical-ring Everting Robot Capable of Omnidirectional Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to conventional wheeled transportation systems designed for flat surfaces, soft robots exhibit exceptional adaptability to various terrains, enabling stable movement in complex environments. However, due to the risk of collision with obstacles and barriers, most soft robots rely on sensors for navigation in unstructured environments with uncertain boundaries. In this work, we present the WHERE-Bot, a wheel-less everting soft robot capable of omnidirectional locomotion. Our WHERE-Bot can navigate through unstructured environments by leveraging its structural and motion advantages rather than relying on sensors for boundary detection. By configuring a spring toy ``Slinky'' into a loop shape, the WHERE-Bot performs multiple rotational motions: spiral-rotating along the hub circumference, self-rotating around the hub's center, and orbiting around a certain point. The robot's trajectories can be reprogrammed by actively altering its mass distribution. The WHERE-Bot shows significant potential for boundary exploration in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot System for Cooperative Exploration in Unknown Environments: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of multi-robot technology, cooperative exploration tasks have garnered increasing attention. This paper presents a comprehensive review of multi-robot cooperative exploration systems. First, we review the evolution of robotic exploration and introduce a modular research framework tailored for multi-robot cooperative exploration. Based on this framework, we systematically categorize and summarize key system components. As a foundational module for multi-robot exploration, the localization and mapping module is primarily introduced by focusing on global and relative pose estimation, as well as multi-robot map merging techniques. The cooperative motion module is further divided into learning-based approaches and multi-stage planning, with the latter encompassing target generation, task allocation, and motion planning strategies. Given the communication constraints of real-world environments, we also analyze the communication module, emphasizing how robots exchange information within local communication ranges and under limited transmission capabilities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions for multi-robot cooperative exploration in light of real-world trends. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field.</description>

      <title>Bioinspired Sensing of Undulatory Flow Fields Generated by Leg Kicks in Swimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The artificial lateral line (ALL) is a bioinspired flow sensing system for underwater robots, comprising of distributed flow sensors. The ALL has been successfully applied to detect the undulatory flow fields generated by body undulation and tail-flapping of bioinspired robotic fish. However, its feasibility and performance in sensing the undulatory flow fields produced by human leg kicks during swimming has not been systematically tested and studied. This paper presents a novel sensing framework to investigate the undulatory flow field generated by swimmer's leg kicks, leveraging bioinspired ALL sensing. To evaluate the feasibility of using the ALL system for sensing the undulatory flow fields generated by swimmer leg kicks, this paper designs an experimental platform integrating an ALL system and a lab-fabricated human leg model. To enhance the accuracy of flow sensing, this paper proposes a feature extraction method that dynamically fuses time-domain and time-frequency characteristics. Specifically, time-domain features are extracted using one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory networks (1DCNN-BiLSTM), while time-frequency features are extracted using short-term Fourier transform and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (STFT-2DCNN). These features are then dynamically fused based on attention mechanisms to achieve accurate sensing of the undulatory flow field. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to test various scenarios inspired by human swimming, such as leg kick pattern recognition and kicking leg localization, achieving satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Self-Corrective Task Planning by Inverse Prompting with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robot task planning, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in generating complex and long-horizon action sequences. However, it is observed that LLMs often produce responses that sound plausible but are not accurate. To address these problems, existing methods typically employ predefined error sets or external knowledge sources, requiring human efforts and computation resources. Recently, self-correction approaches have emerged, where LLM generates and refines plans, identifying errors by itself. Despite their effectiveness, they are more prone to failures in correction due to insufficient reasoning. In this paper, we introduce InversePrompt, a novel self-corrective task planning approach that leverages inverse prompting to enhance interpretability. Our method incorporates reasoning steps to provide clear, interpretable feedback. It generates inverse actions corresponding to the initially generated actions and verifies whether these inverse actions can restore the system to its original state, explicitly validating the logical coherence of the generated plans. The results on benchmark datasets show an average 16.3% higher success rate over existing LLM-based task planning methods. Our approach offers clearer justifications for feedback in real-world environments, resulting in more successful task completion than existing self-correction approaches across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Decapod Robot with Rotary Bellows-Enclosed Soft Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft crawling robots exhibit efficient locomotion across various terrains and demonstrate robustness to diverse environmental conditions. Here, we propose a valveless soft-legged robot that integrates a pair of rotary bellows-enclosed soft transmission systems (R-BESTS). The proposed R-BESTS can directly transmit the servo rotation into leg swing motion. A timing belt controls the pair of R-BESTS to maintain synchronous rotation in opposite phases, realizing alternating tripod gaits of walking and turning. We explored several designs to understand the role of a reinforcement skeleton in twisting the R-BESTS' input bellows units. The bending sequences of the robot legs are controlled through structural design for the output bellows units. Finally, we demonstrate untethered locomotion with the soft robotic decapod. Experimental results show that our robot can walk at 1.75 centimeters per second (0.07 body length per second) for 90 min, turn with a 15-centimeter (0.6 BL) radius, carry a payload of 200 g, and adapt to different terrains.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Path Navigation for Motion Agents with LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalizable reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their efficacies in spatial path planning and obstacle-free trajectory generation remain underexplored. Leveraging LLMs for navigation holds significant potential, given LLMs' ability to handle unseen scenarios, support user-agent interactions, and provide global control across complex systems, making them well-suited for agentic planning and humanoid motion generation. As one of the first studies in this domain, we explore the zero-shot navigation and path generation capabilities of LLMs by constructing a dataset and proposing an evaluation protocol. Specifically, we represent paths using anchor points connected by straight lines, enabling movement in various directions. This approach offers greater flexibility and practicality compared to previous methods while remaining simple and intuitive for LLMs. We demonstrate that, when tasks are well-structured in this manner, modern LLMs exhibit substantial planning proficiency in avoiding obstacles while autonomously refining navigation with the generated motion to reach the target. Further, this spatial reasoning ability of a single LLM motion agent interacting in a static environment can be seamlessly generalized in multi-motion agents coordination in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on single-step planning or local policies, our training-free LLM-based method enables global, dynamic, closed-loop planning, and autonomously resolving collision issues.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances in world models, which primarily focus on learning fine-grained correlations between an agent's motion trajectory and the resulting changes in its surrounding environment. However, existing methods often struggle to capture such fine-grained correlations and achieve real-time predictions. To address this, we propose a new 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving, termed T$^3$Former. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact triplane representation that efficiently compresses the 3D semantically occupied environment. Next, T$^3$Former extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from the historical triplane and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict the next triplane changes. Finally, T$^3$Former combines the triplane changes with the previous ones to decode them into future occupancy results and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of T$^3$Former, achieving 1.44$\times$ faster inference speed (26 FPS), while improving the mean IoU to 36.09 and reducing the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.</description>

      <title>Research and Design on Intelligent Recognition of Unordered Targets for Robots Based on Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of robot target recognition research driven by artificial intelligence (AI), factors such as the disordered distribution of targets, the complexity of the environment, the massive scale of data, and noise interference have significantly restricted the improvement of target recognition accuracy. Against the backdrop of the continuous iteration and upgrading of current AI technologies, to meet the demand for accurate recognition of disordered targets by intelligent robots in complex and changeable scenarios, this study innovatively proposes an AI - based intelligent robot disordered target recognition method using reinforcement learning. This method processes the collected target images with the bilateral filtering algorithm, decomposing them into low - illumination images and reflection images. Subsequently, it adopts differentiated AI strategies, compressing the illumination images and enhancing the reflection images respectively, and then fuses the two parts of images to generate a new image. On this basis, this study deeply integrates deep learning, a core AI technology, with the reinforcement learning algorithm. The enhanced target images are input into a deep reinforcement learning model for training, ultimately enabling the AI - based intelligent robot to efficiently recognize disordered targets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only significantly improve the quality of target images but also enable the AI - based intelligent robot to complete the recognition task of disordered targets with higher efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating extremely high application value and broad development prospects in the field of AI robots.</description>

      <title>AffordDexGrasp: Open-set Language-guided Dexterous Grasp with Generalizable-Instructive Affordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-guided robot dexterous generation enables robots to grasp and manipulate objects based on human commands. However, previous data-driven methods are hard to understand intention and execute grasping with unseen categories in the open set. In this work, we explore a new task, Open-set Language-guided Dexterous Grasp, and find that the main challenge is the huge gap between high-level human language semantics and low-level robot actions. To solve this problem, we propose an Affordance Dexterous Grasp (AffordDexGrasp) framework, with the insight of bridging the gap with a new generalizable-instructive affordance representation. This affordance can generalize to unseen categories by leveraging the object's local structure and category-agnostic semantic attributes, thereby effectively guiding dexterous grasp generation. Built upon the affordance, our framework introduces Affordacne Flow Matching (AFM) for affordance generation with language as input, and Grasp Flow Matching (GFM) for generating dexterous grasp with affordance as input. To evaluate our framework, we build an open-set table-top language-guided dexterous grasp dataset. Extensive experiments in the simulation and real worlds show that our framework surpasses all previous methods in open-set generalization.</description>

      <title>Towards Safe Robot Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot foundation models hold the potential for deployment across diverse environments, from industrial applications to household tasks. While current research focuses primarily on the policies' generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks, it fails to address safety, a critical requirement for deployment on real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce a safety layer designed to constrain the action space of any generalist policy appropriately. Our approach uses ATACOM, a safe reinforcement learning algorithm that creates a safe action space and, therefore, ensures safe state transitions. By extending ATACOM to generalist policies, our method facilitates their deployment in safety-critical scenarios without requiring any specific safety fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this safety layer in an air hockey environment, where it prevents a puck-hitting agent from colliding with its surroundings, a failure observed in generalist policies.</description>

      <title>PER-DPP Sampling Framework and Its Application in Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in intelligent mobile systems represents a core research focus within artificial intelligence-driven robotics. Contemporary path planning approaches face constraints in dynamic environmental responsiveness and multi-objective task scalability, limiting their capacity to address growing intelligent operation requirements. Decision-centric reinforcement learning frameworks, capitalizing on their unique strengths in adaptive environmental interaction and self-optimization, have gained prominence in advanced control system research. This investigation introduces methodological improvements to address sample homogeneity challenges in reinforcement learning experience replay mechanisms. By incorporating determinant point processes (DPP) for diversity assessment, we develop a dual-criteria sampling framework with adaptive selection protocols. This approach resolves representation bias in conventional prioritized experience replay (PER) systems while preserving algorithmic interoperability, offering improved decision optimization for dynamic operational scenarios. Key contributions comprise: Develop a hybrid sampling paradigm (PER-DPP) combining priority sequencing with diversity maximization.Based on this,create an integrated optimization scheme (PER-DPP-Elastic DQN) merging diversity-aware sampling with adaptive step-size regulation. Comparative simulations in 2D navigation scenarios demonstrate that the elastic step-size component temporarily delays initial convergence speed but synergistically enhances final-stage optimization with PER-DPP integration. The synthesized method generates navigation paths with optimized length efficiency and directional stability.</description>

      <title>Advances in Hybrid Modular Climbing Robots: Design Principles and Refinement Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the design strategies for hybrid pole- or trunk-climbing robots, focusing on methods to inform design decisions and assess metrics such as adaptability and performance. A wheeled-grasping hybrid robot with modular, tendon-driven grasping arms and a wheeled drive system mounted on a turret was developed to climb columns of varying diameters. Here, the key innovation is the underactuated arms that can be adjusted to different column sizes by adding or removing modular linkages, though the robot also features capabilities like self-locking (the ability of the robot to stay on the column by friction without power), autonomous grasping, and rotation around the column axis. Mathematical models describe conditions for self-locking and vertical climbing. Experimental results demonstrate the robot's efficacy in climbing and self-locking, validating the proposed models and highlighting the potential for fully automated solutions in industrial applications. This work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and designing hybrid climbing robots, contributing to advancements in autonomous robotics for environments where climbing tall structures is critical.</description>

      <title>CATPlan: Loss-based Collision Prediction in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increased interest in the design, training, and evaluation of end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) systems. One often overlooked aspect is the uncertainty of planned trajectories predicted by these systems, despite awareness of their own uncertainty being key to achieve safety and robustness. We propose to estimate this uncertainty by adapting loss prediction from the uncertainty quantification literature. To this end, we introduce a novel light-weight module, dubbed CATPlan, that is trained to decode motion and planning embeddings into estimates of the collision loss used to partially supervise end-to-end AD systems. During inference, these estimates are interpreted as collision risk. We evaluate CATPlan on the safety-critical, nerf-based, closed-loop benchmark NeuroNCAP and find that it manages to detect collisions with a $54.8\%$ relative improvement to average precision over a GMM-based baseline in which the predicted trajectory is compared to the forecasted trajectories of other road users. Our findings indicate that the addition of CATPlan can lead to safer end-to-end AD systems and hope that our work will spark increased interest in uncertainty quantification for such systems.</description>

      <title>Augmented Carpentry: Computer Vision-assisted Framework for Manual Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary electric woodworking tools are integrated into a multiple-object-aware augmented framework to assist operators in fabrication tasks. This study presents an advanced evaluation of the developed open-source fabrication software Augmented Carpentry (AC), focusing on the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and precision of the proposed system, which is designed to recognize both objects and tools. In the workflow, computer vision tools and sensors implement inside-out tracking techniques for the retrofitting tools. This method enables operators to perform precise saw-cutting and drilling tasks using computer-generated feedback. In the design and manufacturing process pipeline, manual fabrication tasks are performed directly from the computer-aided design environment, as computer numerical control machines are widely used in the timber construction industry. Traditional non-digital methods employing execution drawings, markings, and jigs can now be replaced, and manual labor can be directly integrated into the digital value chain. First, this paper introduces the developed methodology and explains its devices and functional phases in detail. Second, the fabrication methodology is evaluated by experimentally scanning the produced one-to-one scale mock-up elements and comparing the discrepancies with their respective three-dimensional execution models. Finally, improvements and limitations in the tool-aware fabrication process, as well as the potential impact of AC in the digital timber fabrication landscape, are discussed.</description>

      <title>QBIT: Quality-Aware Cloud-Based Benchmarking for Robotic Insertion Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insertion tasks are fundamental yet challenging for robots, particularly in autonomous operations, due to their continuous interaction with the environment. AI-based approaches appear to be up to the challenge, but in production they must not only achieve high success rates. They must also ensure insertion quality and reliability. To address this, we introduce QBIT, a quality-aware benchmarking framework that incorporates additional metrics such as force energy, force smoothness and completion time to provide a comprehensive assessment. To ensure statistical significance and minimize the sim-to-real gap, we randomize contact parameters in the MuJoCo simulator, account for perceptual uncertainty, and conduct large-scale experiments on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Our microservice-oriented architecture ensures extensibility, broad applicability, and improved reproducibility. To facilitate seamless transitions to physical robotic testing, we use ROS2 with containerization to reduce integration barriers. We evaluate QBIT using three insertion approaches: geometricbased, force-based, and learning-based, in both simulated and real-world environments. In simulation, we compare the accuracy of contact simulation using different mesh decomposition techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QBIT in comparing different insertion approaches and accelerating the transition from laboratory to real-world applications.

      <title>Learning Physics-Based Full-Body Human Reaching and Grasping from Brief Walking References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing motion generation methods based on mocap data are often limited by data quality and coverage. In this work, we propose a framework that generates diverse, physically feasible full-body human reaching and grasping motions using only brief walking mocap data. Base on the observation that walking data captures valuable movement patterns transferable across tasks and, on the other hand, the advanced kinematic methods can generate diverse grasping poses, which can then be interpolated into motions to serve as task-specific guidance. Our approach incorporates an active data generation strategy to maximize the utility of the generated motions, along with a local feature alignment mechanism that transfers natural movement patterns from walking data to enhance both the success rate and naturalness of the synthesized motions. By combining the fidelity and stability of natural walking with the flexibility and generalizability of task-specific generated data, our method demonstrates strong performance and robust adaptability in diverse scenes and with unseen objects.</description>

      <title>Blind-Wayfarer: A Minimalist, Probing-Driven Framework for Resilient Navigation in Perception-Degraded Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating autonomous robots through dense forests and rugged terrains is especially daunting when exteroceptive sensors -- such as cameras and LiDAR sensors -- fail under occlusions, low-light conditions, or sensor noise. We present Blind-Wayfarer, a probing-driven navigation framework inspired by maze-solving algorithms that relies primarily on a compass to robustly traverse complex, unstructured environments. In 1,000 simulated forest experiments, Blind-Wayfarer achieved a 99.7% success rate. In real-world tests in two distinct scenarios -- with rover platforms of different sizes -- our approach successfully escaped forest entrapments in all 20 trials. Remarkably, our framework also enabled a robot to escape a dense woodland, traveling from 45 m inside the forest to a paved pathway at its edge. These findings highlight the potential of probing-based methods for reliable navigation in challenging perception-degraded field conditions.

      <title>Force Aware Branch Manipulation To Assist Agricultural Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07497v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a methodology to safely manipulate branches to aid various agricultural tasks. Humans in a real agricultural environment often manipulate branches to perform agricultural tasks effectively, but current agricultural robots lack this capability. This proposed strategy to manipulate branches can aid in different precision agriculture tasks, such as fruit picking in dense foliage, pollinating flowers under occlusion, and moving overhanging vines and branches for navigation. The proposed method modifies RRT* to plan a path that satisfies the branch geometric constraints and obeys branch deformable characteristics. Re-planning is done to obtain a path that helps the robot exert force within a desired range so that branches are not damaged during manipulation. Experimentally, this method achieved a success rate of 78% across 50 trials, successfully moving a branch from different starting points to a target region.</description>

      <title>PIPE Planner: Pathwise Information Gain with Map Predictions for Indoor Robot Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration in unknown environments requires estimating the information gain of an action to guide planning decisions. While prior approaches often compute information gain at discrete waypoints, pathwise integration offers a more comprehensive estimation but is often computationally challenging or infeasible and prone to overestimation. In this work, we propose the Pathwise Information Gain with Map Prediction for Exploration (PIPE) planner, which integrates cumulative sensor coverage along planned trajectories while leveraging map prediction to mitigate overestimation. To enable efficient pathwise coverage computation, we introduce a method to efficiently calculate the expected observation mask along the planned path, significantly reducing computational overhead. We validate PIPE on real-world floorplan datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of integrating predictive mapping with pathwise information gain for efficient and informed exploration.</description>

      <title>PointVLA: Injecting the 3D World into Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at robotic tasks by leveraging large-scale 2D vision-language pretraining, but their reliance on RGB images limits spatial reasoning critical for real-world interaction. Retraining these models with 3D data is computationally prohibitive, while discarding existing 2D datasets wastes valuable resources. To bridge this gap, we propose PointVLA, a framework that enhances pre-trained VLAs with point cloud inputs without requiring retraining. Our method freezes the vanilla action expert and injects 3D features via a lightweight modular block. To identify the most effective way of integrating point cloud representations, we conduct a skip-block analysis to pinpoint less useful blocks in the vanilla action expert, ensuring that 3D features are injected only into these blocks--minimizing disruption to pre-trained representations.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointVLA outperforms state-of-the-art 2D imitation learning methods, such as OpenVLA, Diffusion Policy and DexVLA, across both simulated and real-world robotic tasks. Specifically, we highlight several key advantages of PointVLA enabled by point cloud integration: (1) Few-shot multi-tasking, where PointVLA successfully performs four different tasks using only 20 demonstrations each; (2) Real-vs-photo discrimination, where PointVLA distinguishes real objects from their images, leveraging 3D world knowledge to improve safety and reliability; (3) Height adaptability, Unlike conventional 2D imitation learning methods, PointVLA enables robots to adapt to objects at varying table height that unseen in train data. Furthermore, PointVLA achieves strong performance in long-horizon tasks, such as picking and packing objects from a moving conveyor belt, showcasing its ability to generalize across complex, dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Geometric Retargeting: A Principled, Ultrafast Neural Hand Retargeting Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Geometric Retargeting (GeoRT), an ultrafast, and principled neural hand retargeting algorithm for teleoperation, developed as part of our recent Dexterity Gen (DexGen) system. GeoRT converts human finger keypoints to robot hand keypoints at 1KHz, achieving state-of-the-art speed and accuracy with significantly fewer hyperparameters. This high-speed capability enables flexible postprocessing, such as leveraging a foundational controller for action correction like DexGen. GeoRT is trained in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for manual annotation of hand pairs. The core of GeoRT lies in novel geometric objective functions that capture the essence of retargeting: preserving motion fidelity, ensuring configuration space (C-space) coverage, maintaining uniform response through high flatness, pinch correspondence and preventing self-collisions. This approach is free from intensive test-time optimization, offering a more scalable and practical solution for real-time hand retargeting.</description>

      <title>Bi-Directional Mental Model Reconciliation for Human-Robot Interaction with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human-robot interactions, human and robot agents maintain internal mental models of their environment, their shared task, and each other. The accuracy of these representations depends on each agent's ability to perform theory of mind, i.e. to understand the knowledge, preferences, and intentions of their teammate. When mental models diverge to the extent that it affects task execution, reconciliation becomes necessary to prevent the degradation of interaction. We propose a framework for bi-directional mental model reconciliation, leveraging large language models to facilitate alignment through semi-structured natural language dialogue. Our framework relaxes the assumption of prior model reconciliation work that either the human or robot agent begins with a correct model for the other agent to align to. Through our framework, both humans and robots are able to identify and communicate missing task-relevant context during interaction, iteratively progressing toward a shared mental model.</description>

      <title>AutoSpatial: Visual-Language Reasoning for Social Robot Navigation through Efficient Spatial Reasoning Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method, AutoSpatial, an efficient approach with structured spatial grounding to enhance VLMs' spatial reasoning. By combining minimal manual supervision with large-scale Visual Question-Answering (VQA) pairs auto-labeling, our approach tackles the challenge of VLMs' limited spatial understanding in social navigation tasks. By applying a hierarchical two-round VQA strategy during training, AutoSpatial achieves both global and detailed understanding of scenarios, demonstrating more accurate spatial perception, movement prediction, Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, final action, and explanation compared to other SOTA approaches. These five components are essential for comprehensive social navigation reasoning. Our approach was evaluated using both expert systems (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) that provided cross-validation scores and human evaluators who assigned relative rankings to compare model performances across four key aspects. Augmented by the enhanced spatial reasoning capabilities, AutoSpatial demonstrates substantial improvements by averaged cross-validation score from expert systems in: perception &amp; prediction (up to 10.71%), reasoning (up to 16.26%), action (up to 20.50%), and explanation (up to 18.73%) compared to baseline models trained only on manually annotated data.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Symmetries of Swarms of Mobile Robots Using Equivariant Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate symmetry properties of distributed systems of mobile robots. We consider a swarm of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ robots in the $\mathcal{OBLOT}$ model and analyze their collective $\mathcal{F}$sync dynamics using of equivariant dynamical systems theory. To this end, we show that the corresponding evolution function commutes with rotational and reflective transformations of $\mathbb{R}^2$. These form a group that is isomorphic to $\mathbf{O}(2) \times S_n$, the product group of the orthogonal group and the permutation on $n$ elements. The theory of equivariant dynamical systems is used to deduce a hierarchy along which symmetries of a robot swarm can potentially increase following an arbitrary protocol. By decoupling the Look phase from the Compute and Move phases in the mathematical description of an LCM cycle, this hierarchy can be characterized in terms of automorphisms of connectivity graphs. In particular, we find all possible types of symmetry increase, if the decoupled Compute and Move phase is invertible. Finally, we apply our results to protocols which induce state-dependent linear dynamics, where the reduced system consisting of only the Compute and Move phase is linear.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Drill Alignment in Surgical Robotics</title>

Abstract: Robotic assistance allows surgeries to be reliably and accurately executed while still under direct supervision of the surgeon, combining the strengths of robotic technology with the surgeon's expertise. This paper describes a robotic system designed to assist in surgical procedures by implementing a virtual drill guide. The system integrates virtual-fixture functionality using a novel virtual-mechanism controller with additional visual feedback. The controller constrains the tool to the desired axis, while allowing axial motion to remain under the surgeon's control. Compared to prior virtual-fixture approaches -- which primarily perform pure energy-shaping and damping injection with linear springs and dampers -- our controller uses a virtual prismatic joint to which the robot is constrained by nonlinear springs, allowing us to easily shape the dynamics of the system. We detail the calibration procedures required to achieve sufficient precision, and describe the implementation of the controller. We apply this system to a veterinary procedure: drilling for transcondylar screw placement in dogs. The results of the trials on 3D-printed bone models demonstrate sufficient precision to perform the procedure and suggest improved angular accuracy and reduced exit translation errors compared to patient specific guides (PSG). Discussion and future improvements follow.</description>

      <title>DriveGen: Towards Infinite Diverse Traffic Scenarios with Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic traffic simulation has become an important tool for autonomous driving training and testing. Although recent data-driven approaches advance realistic behavior generation, their learning still relies primarily on a single real-world dataset, which limits their diversity and thereby hinders downstream algorithm optimization. In this paper, we propose DriveGen, a novel traffic simulation framework with large models for more diverse traffic generation that supports further customized designs. DriveGen consists of two internal stages: the initialization stage uses large language model and retrieval technique to generate map and vehicle assets; the rollout stage outputs trajectories with selected waypoint goals from visual language model and a specific designed diffusion planner. Through this two-staged process, DriveGen fully utilizes large models' high-level cognition and reasoning of driving behavior, obtaining greater diversity beyond datasets while maintaining high realism. To support effective downstream optimization, we additionally develop DriveGen-CS, an automatic corner case generation pipeline that uses failures of the driving algorithm as additional prompt knowledge for large models without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments show that our generated scenarios and corner cases have a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Downstream experiments further verify that the synthesized traffic of DriveGen provides better optimization of the performance of typical driving algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Closing the Intent-to-Reality Gap via Fulfillment Priority Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practitioners designing reinforcement learning policies face a fundamental challenge: translating intended behavioral objectives into representative reward functions. This challenge stems from behavioral intent requiring simultaneous achievement of multiple competing objectives, typically addressed through labor-intensive linear reward composition that yields brittle results. Consider the ubiquitous robotics scenario where performance maximization directly conflicts with energy conservation. Such competitive dynamics are resistant to simple linear reward combinations. In this paper, we present the concept of objective fulfillment upon which we build Fulfillment Priority Logic (FPL). FPL allows practitioners to define logical formula representing their intentions and priorities within multi-objective reinforcement learning. Our novel Balanced Policy Gradient algorithm leverages FPL specifications to achieve up to 500\% better sample efficiency compared to Soft Actor Critic. Notably, this work constitutes the first implementation of non-linear utility scalarization design, specifically for continuous control problems.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised C-Uniform Trajectory Sampler with Applications to Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive controllers generate trajectories by sampling control inputs from a fixed, simple distribution such as the normal or uniform distributions. This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.</description>

      <title>A Novel Control Strategy for Offset Points Tracking in the Context of Agricultural Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method to control a rigidly connected location on the vehicle, such as a point on the implement in case of agricultural tasks. Agricultural robots are transforming modern farming by enabling precise and efficient operations, replacing humans in arduous tasks while reducing the use of chemicals. Traditionnaly, path_following algorithms are designed to guide the vehicle's center along a predefined trajetory. However, since the actual agronomic task is performed by the implement, it is essential to control a specific point on the implement itself rather than vehicle's center. As such, we present in this paper two approaches for achieving the control of an offset point on the robot. The first approach adapts existing control laws, initially inteded for rear axle's midpoint, to manage the desired lateral deviation. The second approach employs backstepping control techniques to create a control law that directly targets the implement. We conduct real-world experiments, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches for offset points control, and demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Safe Distributed Learning-Enhanced Predictive Control for Multiple Quadrupedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit remarkable adaptability in unstructured environments, making them well-suited for formation control in real-world applications. However, keeping stable formations while ensuring collision-free navigation presents significant challenges due to dynamic obstacles, communication constraints, and the complexity of legged locomotion. This paper proposes a distributed model predictive control framework for multi-quadruped formation control, integrating Control Lyapunov Functions to ensure formation stability and Control Barrier Functions for decentralized safety enforcement. To address the challenge of dynamically changing team structures, we introduce Scale-Adaptive Permutation-Invariant Encoding (SAPIE), which enables robust feature encoding of neighboring robots while preserving permutation invariance. Additionally, we develop a low-latency Data Distribution Service-based communication protocol and an event-triggered deadlock resolution mechanism to enhance real-time coordination and prevent motion stagnation in constrained spaces. Our framework is validated through high-fidelity simulations in NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim and real-world experiments using our custom quadrupedal robotic system, XG. Results demonstrate stable formation control, real-time feasibility, and effective collision avoidance, validating its potential for large-scale deployment.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Trip Time-Dependent Mix Vehicle Routing Problem for Hybrid Autonomous Shared Delivery Location and Traditional Door-to-Door Delivery Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rising labor costs and increasing logistical demands pose significant challenges to modern delivery systems. Automated Electric Vehicles (AEVs) could reduce reliance on delivery personnel and increase route flexibility, but their adoption is limited due to varying customer acceptance and integration complexities. Shared Distribution Locations (SDLs) offer an alternative to door-to-door (D2D) delivery by providing a wider delivery window and serving multiple community customers, thereby improving last-mile logistics through reduced delivery time, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction.This paper introduces the Multi-Trip Time-Dependent Hybrid Vehicle Routing Problem (MTTD-MVRP), a challenging variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) that combines Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEVs) with conventional vehicles. The problem's complexity arises from factors such as time-dependent travel speeds, strict time windows, battery limitations, and driver labor constraints, while integrating both SDLs and D2D deliveries. To solve the MTTD-MVRP efficiently, we develop a tailored meta-heuristic based on Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) augmented with column generation (CG). This approach intensively explores the solution space using problem-specific operators and adaptively refines solutions, balancing high-quality outcomes with computational effort. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method delivers near-optimal solutions for large-scale instances within practical time limits.From a managerial perspective, our findings highlight the importance of integrating autonomous and human-driven vehicles in last-mile logistics. Decision-makers can leverage SDLs to reduce operational costs and carbon footprints while still accommodating customers who require or prefer D2D services.</description>

      <title>Towards Ambiguity-Free Spatial Foundation Model: Rethinking and Decoupling Depth Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth ambiguity is a fundamental challenge in spatial scene understanding, especially in transparent scenes where single-depth estimates fail to capture full 3D structure. Existing models, limited to deterministic predictions, overlook real-world multi-layer depth. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models. We first present \texttt{MD-3k}, a benchmark exposing depth biases in expert and foundational models through multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics. To resolve depth ambiguity, we propose Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. By integrating LVP-inferred depth with standard RGB-based estimates, our approach elicits multi-layer depth without model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LVP in zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation, unlocking more robust and comprehensive geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference. Our benchmark and code will be available at https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space.</description>

      <title>Fish2Mesh Transformer: 3D Human Mesh Recovery from Egocentric Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Egocentric human body estimation allows for the inference of user body pose and shape from a wearable camera's first-person perspective. Although research has used pose estimation techniques to overcome self-occlusions and image distortions caused by head-mounted fisheye images, similar advances in 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) techniques have been limited. We introduce Fish2Mesh, a fisheye-aware transformer-based model designed for 3D egocentric human mesh recovery. We propose an egocentric position embedding block to generate an ego-specific position table for the Swin Transformer to reduce fisheye image distortion. Our model utilizes multi-task heads for SMPL parametric regression and camera translations, estimating 3D and 2D joints as auxiliary loss to support model training. To address the scarcity of egocentric camera data, we create a training dataset by employing the pre-trained 4D-Human model and third-person cameras for weak supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that Fish2Mesh outperforms previous state-of-the-art 3D HMR models.</description>

      <title>System 0/1/2/3: Quad-process theory for multi-timescale embodied collective cognitive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.</description>

      <title>Object-Centric World Model for Language-Guided Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.</description>

For traffic sign recognition, we systematically evaluate ResNet-50, YOLOv8, and RT-DETR, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 99.8% with ResNet-50, 98.0% accuracy with YOLOv8, and achieved 96.6% accuracy in RT-DETR despite its higher computational complexity. For lane detection, we propose a CNN-based segmentation method enhanced by polynomial curve fitting, which delivers high accuracy under favorable conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight, Multimodal, LLM-based framework that directly undergoes instruction tuning using small yet diverse datasets, eliminating the need for initial pretraining. This framework effectively handles various lane types, complex intersections, and merging zones, significantly enhancing lane detection reliability by reasoning under adverse conditions. Despite constraints in available training resources, our multimodal approach demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities, achieving a Frame Overall Accuracy (FRM) of 53.87%, a Question Overall Accuracy (QNS) of 82.83%, lane detection accuracies of 99.6% in clear conditions and 93.0% at night, and robust performance in reasoning about lane invisibility due to rain (88.4%) or road degradation (95.6%). The proposed comprehensive framework markedly enhances AV perception reliability, thus contributing significantly to safer autonomous driving across diverse and challenging road scenarios.</description>

      <title>TextInPlace: Indoor Visual Place Recognition in Repetitive Structures with Scene Text Spotting and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial capability for long-term autonomous robots, enabling them to identify previously visited locations using visual information. However, existing methods remain limited in indoor settings due to the highly repetitive structures inherent in such environments. We observe that scene text typically appears in indoor spaces, serving to distinguish visually similar but different places. This inspires us to propose TextInPlace, a simple yet effective VPR framework that integrates Scene Text Spotting (STS) to mitigate visual perceptual ambiguity in repetitive indoor environments. Specifically, TextInPlace adopts a dual-branch architecture within a local parameter sharing network. The VPR branch employs attention-based aggregation to extract global descriptors for coarse-grained retrieval, while the STS branch utilizes a bridging text spotter to detect and recognize scene text. Finally, the discriminative text is filtered to compute text similarity and re-rank the top-K retrieved images. To bridge the gap between current text-based repetitive indoor scene datasets and the typical scenarios encountered in robot navigation, we establish an indoor VPR benchmark dataset, called Maze-with-Text. Extensive experiments on both custom and public datasets demonstrate that TextInPlace achieves superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on appearance information. The dataset, code, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/HqiTao/TextInPlace.</description>

      <title>Infinite Leagues Under the Sea: Photorealistic 3D Underwater Terrain Generation by Latent Fractal Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of generating representations of underwater 3D terrain. Off-the-shelf generative models, trained on Internet-scale data but not on specialized underwater images, exhibit downgraded realism, as images of the seafloor are relatively uncommon. To this end, we introduce DreamSea, a generative model to generate hyper-realistic underwater scenes. DreamSea is trained on real-world image databases collected from underwater robot surveys. Images from these surveys contain massive real seafloor observations and covering large areas, but are prone to noise and artifacts from the real world. We extract 3D geometry and semantics from the data with visual foundation models, and train a diffusion model that generates realistic seafloor images in RGBD channels, conditioned on novel fractal distribution-based latent embeddings. We then fuse the generated images into a 3D map, building a 3DGS model supervised by 2D diffusion priors which allows photorealistic novel view rendering. DreamSea is rigorously evaluated, demonstrating the ability to robustly generate large-scale underwater scenes that are consistent, diverse, and photorealistic. Our work drives impact in multiple domains, spanning filming, gaming, and robot simulation.</description>

      <title>HierDAMap: Towards Universal Domain Adaptive BEV Mapping via Hierarchical Perspective Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of Bird's-Eye View (BEV) mapping technology has driven significant innovation in visual perception technology for autonomous driving. BEV mapping models need to be applied to the unlabeled real world, making the study of unsupervised domain adaptation models an essential path. However, research on unsupervised domain adaptation for BEV mapping remains limited and cannot perfectly accommodate all BEV mapping tasks. To address this gap, this paper proposes HierDAMap, a universal and holistic BEV domain adaptation framework with hierarchical perspective priors. Unlike existing research that solely focuses on image-level learning using prior knowledge, this paper explores the guiding role of perspective prior knowledge across three distinct levels: global, sparse, and instance levels. With these priors, HierDA consists of three essential components, including Semantic-Guided Pseudo Supervision (SGPS), Dynamic-Aware Coherence Learning (DACL), and Cross-Domain Frustum Mixing (CDFM). SGPS constrains the cross-domain consistency of perspective feature distribution through pseudo labels generated by vision foundation models in 2D space. To mitigate feature distribution discrepancies caused by spatial variations, DACL employs uncertainty-aware predicted depth as an intermediary to derive dynamic BEV labels from perspective pseudo-labels, thereby constraining the coarse BEV features derived from corresponding perspective features. CDFM, on the other hand, leverages perspective masks of view frustum to mix multi-view perspective images from both domains, which guides cross-domain view transformation and encoding learning through mixed BEV labels. The proposed method is verified on multiple BEV mapping tasks, such as BEV semantic segmentation, high-definition semantic, and vectorized mapping. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lynn-yu/HierDAMap.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Revisit of Pre-Trained Vision Models for Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) are fundamental to modern robotics, yet their optimal configuration remains unclear. Through systematic evaluation, we find that while DINO and iBOT outperform MAE across visuomotor control and perception tasks, they struggle when trained on non-(single-)object-centric (NOC) data--a limitation strongly correlated with their diminished ability to learn object-centric representations. This investigation indicates that the ability to form object-centric representations from the non-object-centric robotics dataset is the key to success for PVMs. Motivated by this discovery, we designed SlotMIM, a method that induces object-centric representations by introducing a semantic bottleneck to reduce the number of prototypes to encourage the emergence of objectness as well as cross-view consistency regularization for encouraging multiview invariance. Our experiments encompass pre-training on object-centric, scene-centric, web-crawled, and ego-centric data. Across all settings, our approach learns transferrable representations and achieves significant improvements over prior work in image recognition, scene understanding, and robot learning evaluations. When scaled up with million-scale datasets, our method also demonstrates superior data efficiency and scalability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SlotMIM.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Framework for Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of intelligent marine robotics, particularly in applications such as marine conservation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. However, this task presents significant challenges due to environmental interference, where marine conditions degrade image quality, and the complexity of maritime scenes, which requires deeper reasoning for accurate recognition. Pure vision models alone are insufficient to address these issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that integrates image data, textual descriptions and classification vectors generated by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), to provide richer semantic understanding and improve recognition accuracy. Our framework employs an efficient multimodal fusion mechanism to further enhance model robustness and adaptability in complex maritime environments. Experimental results show that our model achieves 98$\%$ accuracy, surpassing previous SOTA models by 3.5$\%$. To optimize deployment on resource-constrained platforms, we adopt activation-aware weight quantization (AWQ) as a lightweight technique, reducing the model size to 68.75MB with only a 0.5$\%$ accuracy drop while significantly lowering computational overhead. This work provides a high-performance solution for real-time maritime scene recognition, enabling Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to support environmental monitoring and disaster response in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Griffin: Aerial-Ground Cooperative Detection and Tracking Dataset and Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements, autonomous driving systems continue to struggle with occluded objects and long-range detection due to the inherent limitations of single-perspective sensing. Aerial-ground cooperation offers a promising solution by integrating UAVs' aerial views with ground vehicles' local observations. However, progress in this emerging field has been hindered by the absence of public datasets and standardized evaluation benchmarks. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive solution for aerial-ground cooperative 3D perception through three key contributions: (1) Griffin, a large-scale multi-modal dataset featuring over 200 dynamic scenes (30k+ frames) with varied UAV altitudes (20-60m), diverse weather conditions, and occlusion-aware 3D annotations, enhanced by CARLA-AirSim co-simulation for realistic UAV dynamics; (2) A unified benchmarking framework for aerial-ground cooperative detection and tracking tasks, including protocols for evaluating communication efficiency, latency tolerance, and altitude adaptability; (3) AGILE, an instance-level intermediate fusion baseline that dynamically aligns cross-view features through query-based interaction, achieving an advantageous balance between communication overhead and perception accuracy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of aerial-ground cooperative perception and demonstrate the direction of further research. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/wang-jh18-SVM/Griffin.</description>

      <title>Performance-driven Constrained Optimal Auto-Tuner for MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in tuning Model Predictive Control (MPC) cost function parameters is to ensure that the system performance stays consistently above a certain threshold. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, COAT-MPC, Constrained Optimal Auto-Tuner for MPC. With every tuning iteration, COAT-MPC gathers performance data and learns by updating its posterior belief. It explores the tuning parameters' domain towards optimistic parameters in a goal-directed fashion, which is key to its sample efficiency. We theoretically analyze COAT-MPC, showing that it satisfies performance constraints with arbitrarily high probability at all times and provably converges to the optimum performance within finite time. Through comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses with a hardware platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of COAT-MPC in comparison to classical Bayesian Optimization (BO) and other state-of-the-art methods. When applied to autonomous racing, our approach outperforms baselines in terms of constraint violations and cumulative regret over time.</description>

      <title>Temporal Overlapping Prediction: A Self-supervised Pre-training Method for LiDAR Moving Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moving object segmentation (MOS) on LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous systems like self-driving vehicles. Previous supervised approaches rely heavily on costly manual annotations, while LiDAR sequences naturally capture temporal motion cues that can be leveraged for self-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{O}verlapping \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{TOP}), a self-supervised pre-training method that alleviate the labeling burden for MOS. \textbf{TOP} explores the temporal overlapping points that commonly observed by current and adjacent scans, and learns spatiotemporal representations by predicting the occupancy states of temporal overlapping points. Moreover, we utilize current occupancy reconstruction as an auxiliary pre-training objective, which enhances the current structural awareness of the model. We conduct extensive experiments and observe that the conventional metric Intersection-over-Union (IoU) shows strong bias to objects with more scanned points, which might neglect small or distant objects. To compensate for this bias, we introduce an additional metric called $\text{mIoU}_{\text{obj}}$ to evaluate object-level performance. Experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI show that \textbf{TOP} outperforms both supervised training-from-scratch baseline and other self-supervised pre-training baselines by up to 28.77\% relative improvement, demonstrating strong transferability across LiDAR setups and generalization to other tasks. Code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>CoT-Drive: Efficient Motion Forecasting for Autonomous Driving with LLMs and Chain-of-Thought Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is crucial for safe autonomous driving (AD). This study proposes CoT-Drive, a novel approach that enhances motion forecasting by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method. We introduce a teacher-student knowledge distillation strategy to effectively transfer LLMs' advanced scene understanding capabilities to lightweight language models (LMs), ensuring that CoT-Drive operates in real-time on edge devices while maintaining comprehensive scene understanding and generalization capabilities. By leveraging CoT prompting techniques for LLMs without additional training, CoT-Drive generates semantic annotations that significantly improve the understanding of complex traffic environments, thereby boosting the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Additionally, we present two new scene description datasets, Highway-Text and Urban-Text, designed for fine-tuning lightweight LMs to generate context-specific semantic annotations. Comprehensive evaluations of five real-world datasets demonstrate that CoT-Drive outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency in handling complex traffic scenarios. Overall, this study is the first to consider the practical application of LLMs in this field. It pioneers the training and use of a lightweight LLM surrogate for motion forecasting, setting a new benchmark and showcasing the potential of integrating LLMs into AD systems.</description>

      <title>A High Efficient and Scalable Obstacle-Avoiding VLSI Global Routing Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Routing is a crucial step in the VLSI design flow. With the advancement of manufacturing technologies, more constraints have emerged in design rules, particularly regarding obstacles during routing, leading to increased routing complexity. Unfortunately, many global routers struggle to efficiently generate obstacle-free solutions due to the lack of scalable obstacle-avoiding tree generation methods and the capability of handling modern designs with complex obstacles and nets. In this work, we propose an efficient obstacle-aware global routing flow for VLSI designs with obstacles. The flow includes a rule-based obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (OARSMT) algorithm during the tree generation phase. This algorithm is both scalable and fast to provide tree topologies avoiding obstacles in the early stage globally. With its guidance, OARSMT-guided and obstacle-aware sparse maze routing are proposed in the later stages to minimize obstacle violations further and reduce overflow costs. Compared to advanced methods on the benchmark with obstacles, our approach successfully eliminates obstacle violations, and reduces wirelength and overflow cost, while sacrificing only a limited number of via counts and runtime overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key to robot-assisted rehabilitation lies in the design of the human-machine interface, which must accommodate the needs of both patients and machines. Current interface designs primarily focus on machine control algorithms, often requiring patients to spend considerable time adapting. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on the Cooperative Adaptive Markov Decision Process (CAMDPs) model to address the fundamental aspects of the interactive learning process, offering theoretical insights and practical guidance. We establish sufficient conditions for the convergence of CAMDPs and ensure the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium points. Leveraging these conditions, we guarantee the system's convergence to a unique Nash equilibrium point. Furthermore, we explore scenarios with multiple Nash equilibrium points, devising strategies to adjust both Value Evaluation and Policy Improvement algorithms to enhance the likelihood of converging to the global minimal Nash equilibrium point. Through numerical experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions and algorithms, demonstrating their applicability and robustness in practical settings. The proposed conditions for convergence and the identification of a unique optimal Nash equilibrium contribute to the development of more effective adaptive systems for human users in robot-assisted rehabilitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AttentionSwarm, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate safe and efficient swarm control across three challenging environments: a landing environment with obstacles, a competitive drone game setting, and a dynamic drone racing scenario. Central to our approach is the Attention Model Based Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework, which integrates attention mechanisms with safety-critical control theory to enable real-time collision avoidance and trajectory optimization. This framework dynamically prioritizes critical obstacles and agents in the swarms vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs formally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints. The safe attention net algorithm was developed and evaluated using a swarm of Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadrotors, which were tested indoors with the Vicon motion capture system to ensure precise localization and control. Experimental results show that our system achieves landing accuracy of 3.02 cm with a mean time of 23 s and collision-free landings in a dynamic landing environment, 100% and collision-free navigation in a drone game environment, and 95% and collision-free navigation for a dynamic multiagent drone racing environment, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. This work offers a promising foundation for applications in dynamic environments where safety and fastness are paramount.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Structural Deflection Estimation in Hydraulically Actuated Systems Using 3D Flexible Multibody Simulation and DNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision, stability, and performance of lightweight high-strength steel structures in heavy machinery is affected by their highly nonlinear dynamics. This, in turn, makes control more difficult, simulation more computationally intensive, and achieving real-time autonomy, using standard approaches, impossible. Machine learning through data-driven, physics-informed and physics-inspired networks, however, promises more computationally efficient and accurate solutions to nonlinear dynamic problems. This study proposes a novel framework that has been developed to estimate real-time structural deflection in hydraulically actuated three-dimensional systems. It is based on SLIDE, a machine-learning-based method to estimate dynamic responses of mechanical systems subjected to forced excitations.~Further, an algorithm is introduced for the data acquisition from a hydraulically actuated system using randomized initial configurations and hydraulic pressures.~The new framework was tested on a hydraulically actuated flexible boom with various sensor combinations and lifting various payloads. The neural network was successfully trained in less time using standard parameters from PyTorch, ADAM optimizer, the various sensor inputs, and minimal output data. The SLIDE-trained neural network accelerated deflection estimation solutions by a factor of $10^7$ in reference to flexible multibody simulation batches and provided reasonable accuracy. These results support the studies goal of providing robust, real-time solutions for control, robotic manipulators, structural health monitoring, and automation problems.</description>

      <title>Robusto-1 Dataset: Comparing Humans and VLMs on real out-of-distribution Autonomous Driving VQA from Peru</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As multimodal foundational models start being deployed experimentally in Self-Driving cars, a reasonable question we ask ourselves is how similar to humans do these systems respond in certain driving situations -- especially those that are out-of-distribution? To study this, we create the Robusto-1 dataset that uses dashcam video data from Peru, a country with one of the worst (aggressive) drivers in the world, a high traffic index, and a high ratio of bizarre to non-bizarre street objects likely never seen in training. In particular, to preliminarly test at a cognitive level how well Foundational Visual Language Models (VLMs) compare to Humans in Driving, we move away from bounding boxes, segmentation maps, occupancy maps or trajectory estimation to multi-modal Visual Question Answering (VQA) comparing both humans and machines through a popular method in systems neuroscience known as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). Depending on the type of questions we ask and the answers these systems give, we will show in what cases do VLMs and Humans converge or diverge allowing us to probe on their cognitive alignment. We find that the degree of alignment varies significantly depending on the type of questions asked to each type of system (Humans vs VLMs), highlighting a gap in their alignment.</description>

      <title>A Representationalist, Functionalist and Naturalistic Conception of Intelligence as a Foundation for AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article analyses foundational principles relevant to the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Intelligence is understood as the ability to create novel skills that allow to achieve goals under previously unknown conditions. To this end, intelligence utilises reasoning methods such as deduction, induction and abduction as well as other methods such as abstraction and classification to develop a world model. The methods are applied to indirect and incomplete representations of the world, which are obtained through perception, for example, and which do not depict the world but only correspond to it. Due to these limitations and the uncertain and contingent nature of reasoning, the world model is constructivist. Its value is functionally determined by its viability, i.e., its potential to achieve the desired goals. In consequence, meaning is assigned to representations by attributing them a function that makes it possible to achieve a goal. This representational and functional conception of intelligence enables a naturalistic interpretation that does not presuppose mental features, such as intentionality and consciousness, which are regarded as independent of intelligence. Based on a phenomenological analysis, it is shown that AGI can gain a more fundamental access to the world than humans, although it is limited by the No Free Lunch theorems, which require assumptions to be made.</description>

      <title>AlphaDrive: Unleashing the Power of VLMs in Autonomous Driving via Reinforcement Learning and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 achieve or even surpass human expert-level performance in complex domains like mathematics and science, with reinforcement learning (RL) and reasoning playing a crucial role. In autonomous driving, recent end-to-end models have greatly improved planning performance but still struggle with long-tailed problems due to limited common sense and reasoning abilities. Some studies integrate vision-language models (VLMs) into autonomous driving, but they typically rely on pre-trained models with simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on driving data, without further exploration of training strategies or optimizations specifically tailored for planning. In this paper, we propose AlphaDrive, a RL and reasoning framework for VLMs in autonomous driving. AlphaDrive introduces four GRPO-based RL rewards tailored for planning and employs a two-stage planning reasoning training strategy that combines SFT with RL. As a result, AlphaDrive significantly improves both planning performance and training efficiency compared to using only SFT or without reasoning. Moreover, we are also excited to discover that, following RL training, AlphaDrive exhibits some emergent multimodal planning capabilities, which is critical for improving driving safety and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, AlphaDrive is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with planning reasoning into autonomous driving. Code will be released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.01691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The essence of the path planning problems is multi-modality constraint. However, most of the current literature has not mentioned this issue. This paper introduces the research progress of path planning based on the multi-modality constraint. The path planning of multi-modality constraint research can be classified into three stages in terms of its basic ingredients (such as shape, kinematics and dynamics et al.): Route Planning, Trajectory Planning and Motion Planning. It then reviews the research methods and classical algorithms, especially those applied to the Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) in every stage. Finally, the paper points out some existing problems in every stage and suggestions for future research.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration and Locomotion with Joint Movements in the Amoebot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are considering the geometric amoebot model where a set of $n$ amoebots is placed on the triangular grid. An amoebot is able to send information to its neighbors, and to move via expansions and contractions. Since amoebots and information can only travel node by node, most problems have a natural lower bound of $\Omega(D)$ where $D$ denotes the diameter of the structure. Inspired by the nervous and muscular system, Feldmann et al. have proposed the reconfigurable circuit extension and the joint movement extension of the amoebot model with the goal of breaking this lower bound.
  In the joint movement extension, the way amoebots move is altered. Amoebots become able to push and pull other amoebots. Feldmann et al. demonstrated the power of joint movements by transforming a line of amoebots into a rhombus within $O(\log n)$ rounds. However, they left the details of the extension open. The goal of this paper is therefore to formalize and extend the joint movement extension. In order to provide a proof of concept for the extension, we consider two fundamental problems of modular robot systems: reconfiguration and locomotion.
  We approach these problems by defining meta-modules of rhombical and hexagonal shape, respectively. The meta-modules are capable of movement primitives like sliding, rotating, and tunneling. This allows us to simulate reconfiguration algorithms of various modular robot systems. Finally, we construct three amoebot structures capable of locomotion by rolling, crawling, and walking, respectively.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Apple Fruitlet Sizing with Next Best View Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a next-best-view planning approach to autonomously size apple fruitlets. State-of-the-art viewpoint planners in agriculture are designed to size large and more sparsely populated fruit. They rely on lower resolution maps and sizing methods that do not generalize to smaller fruit sizes. To overcome these limitations, our method combines viewpoint sampling around semantically labeled regions of interest, along with an attention-guided information gain mechanism to more strategically select viewpoints that target the small fruits' volume. Additionally, we integrate a dual-map representation of the environment that is able to both speed up expensive ray casting operations and maintain the high occupancy resolution required to informatively plan around the fruit. When sizing, a robust estimation and graph clustering approach is introduced to associate fruit detections across images. Through simulated experiments, we demonstrate that our viewpoint planner improves sizing accuracy compared to state of the art and ablations. We also provide quantitative results on data collected by a real robotic system in the field.</description>

      <title>Split Covariance Intersection Filter Based Visual Localization With Accurate AprilTag Map For Warehouse Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient localization with conveniently-established map is the fundamental requirement for mobile robot operation in warehouse environments. An accurate AprilTag map can be conveniently established with the help of LiDAR-based SLAM. It is true that a LiDAR-based system is usually not commercially competitive in contrast with a vision-based system, yet fortunately for warehouse applications, only a single LiDAR-based SLAM system is needed to establish an accurate AprilTag map, whereas a large amount of visual localization systems can share this established AprilTag map for their own operations. Therefore, the cost of a LiDAR-based SLAM system is actually shared by the large amount of visual localization systems, and turns to be acceptable and even negligible for practical warehouse applications. Once an accurate AprilTag map is available, visual localization is realized as recursive estimation that fuses AprilTag measurements (i.e. AprilTag detection results) and robot motion data. AprilTag measurements may be nonlinear partial measurements; this can be handled by the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the spirit of local linearization. AprilTag measurements tend to have temporal correlation as well; however, this cannot be reasonably handled by the EKF. The split covariance intersection filter (Split CIF) is adopted to handle temporal correlation among AprilTag measurements. The Split CIF (in the spirit of local linearization) can also handle AprilTag nonlinear partial measurements. The Split CIF based visual localization system incorporates a measurement adaptive mechanism to handle outliers in AprilTag measurements and adopts a dynamic initialization mechanism to address the kidnapping problem. A comparative study in real warehouse environments demonstrates the potential and advantage of the Split CIF based visual localization solution.</description>

      <title>Underwater Motions Analysis and Control of a Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicles (UAAVs) have gained increasing importance, yet lack comprehensive analysis and suitable controllers. This paper analyzes the underwater motion characteristics of a self-designed UAAV, Mirs-Alioth, and designs a controller for it. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through experiments. The singularities of Mirs-Alioth are derived as Singular Thrust Tilt Angle (STTA), which serve as an essential tool for an analysis of its underwater motion characteristics. The analysis reveals several key factors for designing the controller. These include the need for logic switching, using a Nussbaum function to compensate control direction uncertainty in the auxiliary channel, and employing an auxiliary controller to mitigate coupling effects. Based on these key points, a control scheme is designed. It consists of a controller that regulates the thrust tilt angle to the singular value, an auxiliary controller incorporating a Saturated Nussbaum function, and a logic switch. Eventually, two sets of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the controller and demonstrate the necessity of the Nussbaum function.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kalman-Informed Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a widely adopted method for sensor fusion in navigation applications. A crucial aspect of the EKF is the online determination of the process noise covariance matrix reflecting the model uncertainty. While common EKF implementation assumes a constant process noise, in real-world scenarios, the process noise varies, leading to inaccuracies in the estimated state and potentially causing the filter to diverge. Model-based adaptive EKF methods were proposed and demonstrated performance improvements to cope with such situations, highlighting the need for a robust adaptive approach. In this paper, we derive an adaptive Kalman-informed transformer (A-KIT) designed to learn the varying process noise covariance online. Built upon the foundations of the EKF, A-KIT utilizes the well-known capabilities of set transformers, including inherent noise reduction and the ability to capture nonlinear behavior in the data. This approach is suitable for any application involving the EKF. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of A-KIT in nonlinear fusion between a Doppler velocity log and inertial sensors. This is accomplished using real data recorded from sensors mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle operating in the Mediterranean Sea. We show that A-KIT outperforms the conventional EKF by more than 49.5% and model-based adaptive EKF by an average of 35.4% in terms of position accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unifying Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning for Human-in-Loop Interactive Socially-aware Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating human-filled spaces is crucial for the interactive social robots to support advanced services, such as cooperative carrying, which enables service provision in complex and crowded environments while adapting behavior based on real-time human language commands or feedback. However, existing social robot navigation planners face two major challenges: managing real-time user inputs and ensuring socially compliant behaviors in unfamiliar, zero-shot environments. In response, we introduce SALM, an interactive, human-in-loop Socially-Aware navigation Large Language Model framework that dynamically integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with large language model (LLM) capabilities. SALM leverages contextual semantic understanding from real-time human-robot interactions to convert high-level user commands into precise, low-level control actions. A high-level LLM module parses user input, guiding the simultaneous generation of navigation commands by both a large language navigation model (LNM) and a DRL-based navigation model (RLNM). A memory mechanism archives temporal data for continuous refinement, while a multi-step graph-of-thoughts inference-based large language feedback model adaptively fuses the strengths of both planning approaches. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SALM not only enhances navigational precision in crowded, dynamic environments but also significantly improves system adaptability, offering tailored behaviors that align with individual user preferences and real-time feedback.

      <description>arXiv:2404.04857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference-aligned robot navigation in human environments is typically achieved through learning-based approaches, utilizing user feedback or demonstrations for personalization. However, personal preferences are subject to change and might even be context-dependent. Yet traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches with static reward functions often fall short in adapting to varying user preferences, inevitably reflecting demonstrations once training is completed. This paper introduces a structured framework that combines demonstration-based learning with multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). To ensure real-world applicability, our approach allows for dynamic adaptation of the robot navigation policy to changing user preferences without retraining. It fluently modulates the amount of demonstration data reflection and other preference-related objectives. Through rigorous evaluations, including a baseline comparison and sim-to-real transfer on two robots, we demonstrate our framework's capability to adapt to user preferences accurately while achieving high navigational performance in terms of collision avoidance and goal pursuance.</description>

      <title>LayeredMAPF: a decomposition of MAPF instance to reduce solving costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) holds significant utility within autonomous systems, however, the calculation and memory space required for multi-agent path finding (MAPF) grows exponentially as the number of agents increases. This often results in some MAPF instances being unsolvable under limited computational resources and memory space, thereby limiting the application of MAPF in complex scenarios. Hence, we propose a decomposition approach for MAPF instances, which breaks down instances involving a large number of agents into multiple isolated subproblems involving fewer agents. Moreover, we present a framework to enable general MAPF algorithms to solve each subproblem independently and merge their solutions into one conflict-free final solution, and avoid loss of solvability as much as possible. Unlike existing works that propose isolated methods aimed at reducing the time cost of MAPF, our method is applicable to all MAPF methods. In our results, we apply decomposition to multiple state-of-the-art MAPF methods using a classic MAPF benchmark\footnote{https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf.html}. The decomposition of MAPF instances is completed on average within 1s, and its application to seven MAPF methods reduces the memory usage or time cost significantly, particularly for serial methods. Based on massive experiments, we speculate the possibilty about loss of solvability caused by our method is $&lt;$ 1\%. To facilitate further research within the community, we have made the source code of the proposed algorithm publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/JoeYao-bit/LayeredMAPF/tree/minimize\_dependence}.</description>

      <title>Speak the Same Language: Global LiDAR Registration on BIM Using Pose Hough Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds and building information modeling (BIM) represent two distinct data modalities in the fields of robot perception and construction. These modalities originate from different sources and are associated with unique reference frames. The primary goal of this study is to align these modalities within a shared reference frame using a global registration approach, effectively enabling them to ``speak the same language''. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modality registration method, spanning from the front end to the back end. At the front end, we extract triangle descriptors by identifying walls and intersected corners, enabling the matching of corner triplets with a complexity independent of the BIM's size. For the back-end transformation estimation, we utilize the Hough transform to map the matched triplets to the transformation space and introduce a hierarchical voting mechanism to hypothesize multiple pose candidates. The final transformation is then verified using our designed occupancy-aware scoring method. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted real-world multi-session experiments in a large-scale university building, employing two different types of LiDAR sensors. We make the collected datasets and codes publicly available to benefit the community.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of robotics, the quest for achieving real-world autonomy, capable of executing large-scale and long-term operations, has positioned place recognition (PR) as a cornerstone technology. Despite the PR community's remarkable strides over the past two decades, garnering attention from fields like computer vision and robotics, the development of PR methods that sufficiently support real-world robotic systems remains a challenge. This paper aims to bridge this gap by highlighting the crucial role of PR within the framework of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) 2.0. This new phase in robotic navigation calls for scalable, adaptable, and efficient PR solutions by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. For this goal, we provide a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) advancements in PR, alongside the remaining challenges, and underscore its broad applications in robotics. This paper begins with an exploration of PR's formulation and key research challenges. We extensively review literature, focusing on related methods on place representation and solutions to various PR challenges. Applications showcasing PR's potential in robotics, key PR datasets, and open-source libraries are discussed. We conclude with a discussion on PR's future directions and provide a summary of the literature covered at: https://github.com/MetaSLAM/GPRS.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning-based Direct Visual Servoing using the Large Projection Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today robots must be safe, versatile, and user-friendly to operate in unstructured and human-populated environments. Dynamical system-based imitation learning enables robots to perform complex tasks stably and without explicit programming, greatly simplifying their real-world deployment. To exploit the full potential of these systems it is crucial to implement closed loops that use visual feedback. Vision permits to cope with environmental changes, but is complex to handle due to the high dimension of the image space. This study introduces a dynamical system-based imitation learning for direct visual servoing. It leverages off-the-shelf deep learning-based perception modules to extract robust features from the raw input image, and an imitation learning strategy to execute sophisticated robot motions. The learning blocks are integrated using the large projection task priority formulation. As demonstrated through extensive experimental analysis, the proposed method realizes complex tasks with a robotic manipulator.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Manipulation using Behavior Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many manipulation tasks pose a challenge since they depend on non-visual environmental information that can only be determined after sustained physical interaction has already begun. This is particularly relevant for effort-sensitive, dynamics-dependent tasks such as tightening a valve. To perform these tasks safely and reliably, robots must be able to quickly adapt in response to unexpected changes during task execution, and should also learn from past experience to better inform future decisions. Humans can intuitively respond and adapt their manipulation strategy to suit such problems, but representing and implementing such behaviors for robots remains a challenge. In this work we show how this can be achieved within the framework of behavior trees. We present the adaptive behavior tree, a scalable and generalizable behavior tree design that enables a robot to quickly adapt to and learn from both visual and non-visual observations during task execution, preempting task failure or switching to a different manipulation strategy. The adaptive behavior tree selects the manipulation strategy that is predicted to optimize task performance, and learns from past experience to improve these predictions for future attempts. We test our approach on a variety of tasks commonly found in industry; the adaptive behavior tree demonstrates safety, robustness (100% success rate) and efficiency in task completion (up to 36% task speedup from the baseline).</description>

      <title>Visual-Inertial SLAM for Unstructured Outdoor Environments: Benchmarking the Benefits and Computational Costs of Loop Closing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for mobile robotics, enabling autonomous navigation in dynamic, unstructured outdoor environments without relying on external positioning systems. These environments pose significant challenges due to variable lighting, weather conditions, and complex terrain. Visual-Inertial SLAM has emerged as a promising solution for robust localization under such conditions. This paper benchmarks several open-source Visual-Inertial SLAM systems, including traditional methods (ORB-SLAM3, VINS-Fusion, OpenVINS, Kimera, and SVO Pro) and learning-based approaches (HFNet-SLAM, AirSLAM), to evaluate their performance in unstructured natural outdoor settings. We focus on the impact of loop closing on localization accuracy and computational demands, providing a comprehensive analysis of these systems' effectiveness in real-world environments and especially their application to embedded systems in outdoor robotics. Our contributions further include an assessment of varying frame rates on localization accuracy and computational load. The findings highlight the importance of loop closing in improving localization accuracy while managing computational resources efficiently, offering valuable insights for optimizing Visual-Inertial SLAM systems for practical outdoor applications in mobile robotics. The dataset and the benchmark code are available under https://github.com/iis-esslingen/vi-slam_lc_benchmark.</description>

      <title>TacSL: A Library for Visuotactile Sensor Simulation and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For both humans and robots, the sense of touch, known as tactile sensing, is critical for performing contact-rich manipulation tasks. Three key challenges in robotic tactile sensing are 1) interpreting sensor signals, 2) generating sensor signals in novel scenarios, and 3) learning sensor-based policies. For visuotactile sensors, interpretation has been facilitated by their close relationship with vision sensors (e.g., RGB cameras). However, generation is still difficult, as visuotactile sensors typically involve contact, deformation, illumination, and imaging, all of which are expensive to simulate; in turn, policy learning has been challenging, as simulation cannot be leveraged for large-scale data collection. We present TacSL (taxel), a library for GPU-based visuotactile sensor simulation and learning. TacSL can be used to simulate visuotactile images and extract contact-force distributions over $200\times$ faster than the prior state-of-the-art, all within the widely-used Isaac Simulator. Furthermore, TacSL provides a learning toolkit containing multiple sensor models, contact-intensive training environments, and online/offline algorithms that can facilitate policy learning for sim-to-real applications. On the algorithmic side, we introduce a novel online reinforcement-learning algorithm called asymmetric actor-critic distillation (AACD), designed to effectively and efficiently learn tactile-based policies in simulation that can transfer to the real world. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our library and algorithms by evaluating the benefits of distillation and multimodal sensing for contact-rich manipulation tasks, and most critically, performing sim-to-real transfer.

      <title>Highly dynamic physical interaction for robotics: design and control of an active remote center of compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10024v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot interaction control is often limited to low dynamics or low flexibility, depending on whether an active or passive approach is chosen. In this work, we introduce a hybrid control scheme that combines the advantages of active and passive interaction control. To accomplish this, we propose the design of a novel Active Remote Center of Compliance (ARCC), which is based on a passive and active element which can be used to directly control the interaction forces. We introduce surrogate models for a dynamic comparison against purely robot-based interaction schemes. In a comparative validation, ARCC drastically improves the interaction dynamics, leading to an increase in the motion bandwidth of up to 31 times. We introduce further our control approach as well as the integration in the robot controller. Finally, we analyze ARCC on different industrial benchmarks like peg-in-hole, top-hat rail assembly and contour following problems and compare it against the state of the art, to highlight the dynamic and flexibility. The proposed system is especially suited if the application requires a low cycle time combined with a sensitive manipulation.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-based Coordinated Task Allocation and Socially-aware Navigation for Multi-Robot Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A team of multiple robots seamlessly and safely working in human-filled public environments requires adaptive task allocation and socially-aware navigation that account for dynamic human behavior. Current approaches struggle with highly dynamic pedestrian movement and the need for flexible task allocation. We propose Hyper-SAMARL, a hypergraph-based system for multi-robot task allocation and socially-aware navigation, leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Hyper-SAMARL models the environmental dynamics between robots, humans, and points of interest (POIs) using a hypergraph, enabling adaptive task assignment and socially-compliant navigation through a hypergraph diffusion mechanism. Our framework, trained with MARL, effectively captures interactions between robots and humans, adapting tasks based on real-time changes in human activity. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper-SAMARL outperforms baseline models in terms of social navigation, task completion efficiency, and adaptability in various simulated scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hier-SLAM: Scaling-up Semantics in SLAM with a Hierarchically Categorical Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12518v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Hier-SLAM, a semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method featuring a novel hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate global 3D semantic mapping, scaling-up capability, and explicit semantic label prediction in the 3D world. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our \MethodName{} outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it achieves on-par semantic rendering performance compared to existing methods while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.

      <description>arXiv:2409.13573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating in human-filled public spaces is a critical challenge for deploying autonomous robots in real-world environments. This paper introduces NaviDIFF, a novel Hamiltonian-constrained socially-aware navigation framework designed to address the complexities of human-robot interaction and socially-aware path planning. NaviDIFF integrates a port-Hamiltonian framework to model dynamic physical interactions and a diffusion model to manage uncertainty in human-robot cooperation. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal transformer to capture social and temporal dependencies, enabling more accurate spatial-temporal environmental dynamics understanding and port-Hamiltonian physical interactive process construction. Additionally, reinforcement learning from human feedback is employed to fine-tune robot policies, ensuring adaptation to human preferences and social norms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NaviDIFF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in social navigation tasks, offering improved stability, efficiency, and adaptability.</description>

      <title>OLiVia-Nav: An Online Lifelong Vision Language Approach for Mobile Robot Social Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Service robots in human-centered environments such as hospitals, office buildings, and long-term care homes need to navigate while adhering to social norms to ensure the safety and comfortability of the people they are sharing the space with. Furthermore, they need to adapt to new social scenarios that can arise during robot navigation. In this paper, we present a novel Online Lifelong Vision Language architecture, OLiVia- Nav, which uniquely integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with an online lifelong learning framework for robot social navigation. We introduce a unique distillation approach, Social Context Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (SC-CLIP), to transfer the social reasoning capabilities of large VLMs to a lightweight VLM, in order for OLiVia-Nav to directly encode social and environment context during robot navigation. These encoded embeddings are used to generate and select robot social compliant trajectories. The lifelong learning capabilities of SC-CLIP enable OLiVia-Nav to update the robot trajectory planning overtime as new social scenarios are encountered. We conducted extensive real-world experiments in diverse social navigation scenarios. The results showed that OLiVia-Nav outperformed existing state-of-the-art DRL and VLM methods in terms of mean squared error, Hausdorff loss, and personal space violation duration. Ablation studies also verified the design choices for OLiVia-Nav.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Evaluating Trust Dynamics in Multi-Human Multi-Robot Task Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trust is essential in human-robot collaboration, particularly in multi-human, multi-robot (MH-MR) teams, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining team cohesion in complex operational environments. Despite its importance, trust is rarely incorporated into task allocation and reallocation algorithms for MH-MR collaboration. While prior research in single-human, single-robot interactions has shown that integrating trust significantly enhances both performance outcomes and user experience, its role in MH-MR task allocation remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Expectation Confirmation Trust (ECT) Model, a novel framework for modeling trust dynamics in MH-MR teams. We evaluate the ECT model against five existing trust models and a no-trust baseline to assess its impact on task allocation outcomes across different team configurations (2H-2R, 5H-5R, and 10H-10R). Our results show that the ECT model improves task success rate, reduces mean completion time, and lowers task error rates. These findings highlight the complexities of trust-based task allocation in MH-MR teams. We discuss the implications of incorporating trust into task allocation algorithms and propose future research directions for adaptive trust mechanisms that balance efficiency and performance in dynamic, multi-agent environments.</description>

      <title>Context-Based Meta Reinforcement Learning for Robust and Adaptable Peg-in-Hole Assembly Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous assembly is an essential capability for industrial and service robots, with Peg-in-Hole (PiH) insertion being one of the core tasks. However, PiH assembly in unknown environments is still challenging due to uncertainty in task parameters, such as the hole position and orientation, resulting from sensor noise. Although context-based meta reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been previously presented to adapt to unknown task parameters in PiH assembly tasks, the performance depends on a sample-inefficient procedure or human demonstrations. Thus, to enhance the applicability of meta RL in real-world PiH assembly tasks, we propose to train the agent to use information from the robot's forward kinematics and an uncalibrated camera. Furthermore, we improve the performance by efficiently adapting the meta-trained agent to use data from force/torque sensor. Finally, we propose an adaptation procedure for out-of-distribution tasks whose parameters are different from the training tasks. Experiments on simulated and real robots prove that our modifications enhance the sample efficiency during meta training, real-world adaptation performance, and generalization of the context-based meta RL agent in PiH assembly tasks compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical use case of SLAM for mobile assistive robots is to support localization during a navigation-based task. Current SLAM benchmarks overlook the significance of repeatability (precision), despite its importance in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose a task-driven approach to SLAM benchmarking, TaskSLAM-Bench. It employs precision as a key metric, accounts for SLAM's mapping capabilities, and has easy-to-meet implementation requirements. Simulated and real-world testing scenarios of SLAM methods provide insights into the navigation performance properties of modern visual and LiDAR SLAM solutions. The outcomes show that passive stereo SLAM operates at a level of precision comparable to LiDAR SLAM in typical indoor environments. TaskSLAM-Bench complements existing benchmarks and offers richer assessment of SLAM performance in navigation-focused scenarios. Publicly available code permits in-situ SLAM testing in custom environments with properly equipped robots.</description>

      <title>Active Vision Might Be All You Need: Exploring Active Vision in Bimanual Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imitation learning has demonstrated significant potential in performing high-precision manipulation tasks using visual feedback. However, it is common practice in imitation learning for cameras to be fixed in place, resulting in issues like occlusion and limited field of view. Furthermore, cameras are often placed in broad, general locations, without an effective viewpoint specific to the robot's task. In this work, we investigate the utility of active vision (AV) for imitation learning and manipulation, in which, in addition to the manipulation policy, the robot learns an AV policy from human demonstrations to dynamically change the robot's camera viewpoint to obtain better information about its environment and the given task. We introduce AV-ALOHA, a new bimanual teleoperation robot system with AV, an extension of the ALOHA 2 robot system, incorporating an additional 7-DoF robot arm that only carries a stereo camera and is solely tasked with finding the best viewpoint. This camera streams stereo video to an operator wearing a virtual reality (VR) headset, allowing the operator to control the camera pose using head and body movements. The system provides an immersive teleoperation experience, with bimanual first-person control, enabling the operator to dynamically explore and search the scene and simultaneously interact with the environment. We conduct imitation learning experiments of our system both in real-world and in simulation, across a variety of tasks that emphasize viewpoint planning. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of human-guided AV for imitation learning, showing significant improvements over fixed cameras in tasks with limited visibility.

Abstract: Global food production depends upon successful pollination, a process that relies on natural and managed pollinators. However, natural pollinators are declining due to factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and pesticide use. This paper presents an integrated robotic system for precision pollination in apples. The system consisted of a machine vision system to identify target flower clusters and estimate their positions and orientations, and a manipulator motion planning and actuation system to guide the sprayer to apply charged pollen suspension to the target flower clusters. The system was tested in the lab, followed by field evaluation in Honeycrisp and Fuji orchards. In the Honeycrisp variety, the robotic pollination system achieved a fruit set of 34.8% of sprayed flowers with 87.5% of flower clusters having at least one fruit when a 2 gm/l pollen suspension was used. In comparison, the natural pollination technique achieved a fruit set of 43.1% with 94.9% of clusters with at least one fruit. In Fuji apples, the robotic system achieved lower pollination success, with 7.2% of sprayed flowers setting fruit and 20.6% of clusters having at least one fruit, compared to 33.1% and 80.6%, respectively, with natural pollination. Fruit quality analysis showed that robotically pollinated fruits were comparable to naturally pollinated fruits in terms of color, weight, diameter, firmness, soluble solids, and starch content. Additionally, the system cycle time was 6.5 seconds per cluster. The results showed a promise for robotic pollination in apple orchards. However, further research and development is needed to improve the system and assess its suitability across diverse orchard environments and apple cultivars.</description>

      <title>Robi Butler: Multimodal Remote Interaction with a Household Robot Assistant</title>

Abstract: Imagine a future when we can Zoom-call a robot to manage household chores remotely. This work takes one step in this direction. Robi Butler is a new household robot assistant that enables seamless multimodal remote interaction. It allows the human user to monitor its environment from a first-person view, issue voice or text commands, and specify target objects through hand-pointing gestures. At its core, a high-level behavior module, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), interprets multimodal instructions to generate multistep action plans. Each plan consists of open-vocabulary primitives supported by vision-language models, enabling the robot to process both textual and gestural inputs. Zoom provides a convenient interface to implement remote interactions between the human and the robot. The integration of these components allows Robi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in real-world home environments in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated the system on various household tasks, demonstrating its ability to execute complex user commands with multimodal inputs. We also conducted a user study to examine how multimodal interaction influences user experiences in remote human-robot interaction. These results suggest that with the advances in robot foundation models, we are moving closer to the reality of remote household robot assistants.</description>

      <title>Learning to Swim: Reinforcement Learning for 6-DOF Control of Thruster-driven Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling AUVs can be challenging because of the effect of complex non-linear hydrodynamic forces acting on the robot, which are significant in water and cannot be ignored. The problem is exacerbated for small AUVs for which the dynamics can change significantly with payload changes and deployments under different hydrodynamic conditions. The common approach to AUV control is a combination of passive stabilization with added buoyancy on top and weights on the bottom, and a PID controller tuned for simple and smooth motion primitives. However, the approach comes at the cost of sluggish controls and often the need to re-tune controllers with configuration changes. In this paper, we propose a fast (trainable in minutes), reinforcement learning-based approach for full 6 degree of freedom (DOF) control of a thruster-driven AUVs, taking 6-DOF command-conditioned inputs direct to thruster outputs. We present a new, highly parallelized simulator for underwater vehicle dynamics. We demonstrate this approach through zero-shot sim-to-real (with no tuning) transfer onto a real AUV that produces comparable results to hand-tuned PID controllers. Furthermore, we show that domain randomization on the simulator produces policies that are robust to small variations in vehicle's physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Divide et Impera: Decoding Impedance Strategies for Robotic Peg-in-Hole Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates robotic peg-in-hole assembly using the Elementary Dynamic Actions (EDA) framework, which models contact-rich tasks through a combination of submovements, oscillations, and mechanical impedance. Rather than focusing on a single optimal parameter set, we analyze the distribution and structure of multiple successful impedance solutions, revealing patterns that guide impedance selection in contactrich robotic manipulation. Experiments with a real robot and four different peg types demonstrate the presence of task-specific and generalized assembly strategies, identified through K-means Clustering. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to represent these findings, highlighting patterns in successful impedance selections. Additionally, a neural-network-based success predictor accurately estimates feasible impedance parameters, reducing the need for extensive trial-and-error tuning. By providing publicly available code, CAD files, and a trained model, this work enhances the accessibility of impedance control and offers a structured approach to programming robotic assembly tasks, particularly for less-experienced users.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Action Sequence Learning for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing a universal policy architecture that performs well across diverse robots and task configurations remains a key challenge. In this work, we address this by representing robot actions as sequential data and generating actions through autoregressive sequence modeling. Existing autoregressive architectures generate end-effector waypoints sequentially as word tokens in language modeling, which are limited to low-frequency control tasks. Unlike language, robot actions are heterogeneous and often include continuous values -- such as joint positions, 2D pixel coordinates, and end-effector poses -- which are not easily suited for language-based modeling. Based on this insight, we introduce a straightforward enhancement: we extend causal transformers' single-token prediction to support predicting a variable number of tokens in a single step through our Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT). This enhancement enables robust performance across diverse tasks of various control frequencies, greater efficiency by having fewer autoregression steps, and lead to a hybrid action sequence design by mixing different types of actions and using a different chunk size for each action type. Based on CCT, we propose the Autoregressive Policy (ARP) architecture, which solves manipulation tasks by generating hybrid action sequences. We evaluate ARP across diverse robotic manipulation environments, including Push-T, ALOHA, and RLBench, and show that ARP, as a universal architecture, matches or outperforms the environment-specific state-of-the-art in all tested benchmarks, while being more efficient in computation and parameter sizes. Videos of our real robot demonstrations, all source code and the pretrained models of ARP can be found at http://github.com/mlzxy/arp.</description>

      <title>HMT-Grasp: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Approach for Robot Grasping in Cluttered Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot grasping, whether handling isolated objects, cluttered items, or stacked objects, plays a critical role in industrial and service applications. However, current visual grasp detection methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) often struggle to adapt to diverse scenarios, as they tend to emphasize either local or global features exclusively, neglecting complementary cues. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer approach to address these challenges. Our method improves robotic visual grasping by effectively capturing both global and local information through the integration of Vision Mamba and parallel convolutional-transformer blocks. This hybrid architecture significantly improves adaptability, precision, and flexibility across various robotic tasks. To ensure a fair evaluation, we conducted extensive experiments on the Cornell, Jacquard, and OCID-Grasp datasets, ranging from simple to complex scenarios. Additionally, we performed both simulated and real-world robotic experiments. The results demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art techniques on standard grasping datasets but also delivers strong performance in both simulation and real-world robot applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Object Properties Using Robot Proprioception via Differentiable Robot-Object Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiable simulation has become a powerful tool for system identification. While prior work has focused on identifying robot properties using robot-specific data or object properties using object-specific data, our approach calibrates object properties by using information from the robot, without relying on data from the object itself. Specifically, we utilize robot joint encoder information, which is commonly available in standard robotic systems. Our key observation is that by analyzing the robot's reactions to manipulated objects, we can infer properties of those objects, such as inertia and softness. Leveraging this insight, we develop differentiable simulations of robot-object interactions to inversely identify the properties of the manipulated objects. Our approach relies solely on proprioception -- the robot's internal sensing capabilities -- and does not require external measurement tools or vision-based tracking systems. This general method is applicable to any articulated robot and requires only joint position information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a low-cost robotic platform, achieving accurate mass and elastic modulus estimations of manipulated objects with just a few seconds of computation on a laptop.</description>

      <title>Next Best Sense: Guiding Vision and Touch with FisherRF for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for active next best view and touch selection for robotic manipulators using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). 3DGS is emerging as a useful explicit 3D scene representation for robotics, as it has the ability to represent scenes in a both photorealistic and geometrically accurate manner. However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline, which enhances the performance of 3DGS in few-view robotics settings. We first elevate the performance of few-shot 3DGS with a novel semantic depth alignment method using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) that we supplement with Pearson depth and surface normal loss to improve color and depth reconstruction of real-world scenes. We then extend FisherRF, a next-best-view selection method for 3DGS, to select views and touch poses based on depth uncertainty. We perform online view selection on a real robot system during live 3DGS training. We motivate our improvements to few-shot GS scenes, and extend depth-based FisherRF to them, where we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements on challenging robot scenes.

      <title>Agile Mobility with Rapid Online Adaptation via Meta-learning and Uncertainty-aware MPPI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern non-linear model-based controllers require an accurate physics model and model parameters to be able to control mobile robots at their limits. Also, due to surface slipping at high speeds, the friction parameters may continually change (like tire degradation in autonomous racing), and the controller may need to adapt rapidly. Many works derive a task-specific robot model with a parameter adaptation scheme that works well for the task but requires a lot of effort and tuning for each platform and task. In this work, we design a full model-learning-based controller based on meta pre-training that can very quickly adapt using few-shot dynamics data to any wheel-based robot with any model parameters, while also reasoning about model uncertainty. We demonstrate our results in small-scale numeric simulation, the large-scale Unity simulator, and on a medium-scale hardware platform with a wide range of settings. We show that our results are comparable to domain-specific well-engineered controllers, and have excellent generalization performance across all scenarios.</description>

      <title>Extended Friction Models for the Physics Simulation of Servo Actuators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate physical simulation is crucial for the development and validation of control algorithms in robotic systems. Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) take notably advantage of extensive simulations to produce efficient robot control. State-of-the-art servo actuator models generally fail at capturing the complex friction dynamics of these systems. This limits the transferability of simulated behaviors to real-world applications. In this work, we present extended friction models that allow to more accurately simulate servo actuator dynamics. We propose a comprehensive analysis of various friction models, present a method for identifying model parameters using recorded trajectories from a pendulum test bench, and demonstrate how these models can be integrated into physics engines.
  The proposed friction models are validated on four distinct servo actuators and tested on 2R manipulators, showing significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Coulomb-Viscous model. Our results highlight the importance of considering advanced friction effects in the simulation of servo actuators to enhance the realism and reliability of robotic simulations.</description>

Abstract: Humanoid robotics faces significant challenges in achieving stable locomotion and recovering from falls in dynamic environments. Traditional methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Key Frame Based (KFB) routines, either require extensive fine-tuning or lack real-time adaptability. This paper introduces FRASA, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that integrates fall recovery and stand up strategies into a unified framework. Leveraging the Cross-Q algorithm, FRASA significantly reduces training time and offers a versatile recovery strategy that adapts to unpredictable disturbances. Comparative tests on Sigmaban humanoid robots demonstrate FRASA superior performance against the KFB method deployed in the RoboCup 2023 by the Rhoban Team, world champion of the KidSize League.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Trajectory Optimization on Generalized Domains Using Maximum Mean Discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel formulation of ergodic trajectory optimization that can be specified over general domains using kernel maximum mean discrepancy. Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a planning neural operator (PNO) for predicting the value function of a motion planning problem. We recast value function approximation as learning a single operator from the cost function space to the value function space, which is defined by an Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE). Therefore, our PNO model, despite being trained with a finite number of samples at coarse resolution, inherits the zero-shot super-resolution property of neural operators. We demonstrate accurate value function approximation at $16\times$ the training resolution on the MovingAI lab's 2D city dataset, compare with state-of-the-art neural value function predictors on 3D scenes from the iGibson building dataset and showcase optimal planning with 4-DOF robotic manipulators. Lastly, we investigate employing the value function output of PNO as a heuristic function to accelerate motion planning. We show theoretically that the PNO heuristic is $\epsilon$-consistent by introducing an inductive bias layer that guarantees our value functions satisfy the triangle inequality. With our heuristic, we achieve a $30\%$ decrease in nodes visited while obtaining near optimal path lengths on the MovingAI lab 2D city dataset, compared to classical planning methods ($A^\ast$, $RRT^\ast$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sim2real for robotic manipulation is difficult due to the challenges of simulating complex contacts and generating realistic task distributions. To tackle the latter problem, we introduce ManipGen, which leverages a new class of policies for sim2real transfer: local policies. Locality enables a variety of appealing properties including invariances to absolute robot and object pose, skill ordering, and global scene configuration. We combine these policies with foundation models for vision, language and motion planning and demonstrate SOTA zero-shot performance of our method to Robosuite benchmark tasks in simulation (97%). We transfer our local policies from simulation to reality and observe they can solve unseen long-horizon manipulation tasks with up to 8 stages with significant pose, object and scene configuration variation. ManipGen outperforms SOTA approaches such as SayCan, OpenVLA, LLMTrajGen and VoxPoser across 50 real-world manipulation tasks by 36%, 76%, 62% and 60% respectively.

      <title>Learning Multi-Agent Loco-Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</description>

      <title>Offline Adaptation of Quadruped Locomotion using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a diffusion-based approach to quadrupedal locomotion that simultaneously addresses the limitations of learning and interpolating between multiple skills and of (modes) offline adapting to new locomotion behaviours after training. This is the first framework to apply classifier-free guided diffusion to quadruped locomotion and demonstrate its efficacy by extracting goal-conditioned behaviour from an originally unlabelled dataset. We show that these capabilities are compatible with a multi-skill policy and can be applied with little modification and minimal compute overhead, i.e., running entirely on the robots onboard CPU. We verify the validity of our approach with hardware experiments on the ANYmal quadruped platform.</description>

      <title>Imagine-2-Drive: Leveraging High-Fidelity World Models via Multi-Modal Diffusion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: World Model-based Reinforcement Learning (WMRL) enables sample efficient policy learning by reducing the need for online interactions which can potentially be costly and unsafe, especially for autonomous driving. However, existing world models often suffer from low prediction fidelity and compounding one-step errors, leading to policy degradation over long horizons. Additionally, traditional RL policies, often deterministic or single Gaussian-based, fail to capture the multi-modal nature of decision-making in complex driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Imagine-2-Drive, a novel WMRL framework that integrates a high-fidelity world model with a multi-modal diffusion-based policy actor. It consists of two key components: DiffDreamer, a diffusion-based world model that generates future observations simultaneously, mitigating error accumulation, and DPA (Diffusion Policy Actor), a diffusion-based policy that models diverse and multi-modal trajectory distributions. By training DPA within DiffDreamer, our method enables robust policy learning with minimal online interactions. We evaluate our method in CARLA using standard driving benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms prior world model baselines, improving Route Completion and Success Rate by 15% and 20% respectively.</description>

      <title>Tactile-based force estimation for interaction control with robot fingers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine dexterous manipulation requires reactive control based on rich sensing of manipulator-object interactions. Tactile sensing arrays provide rich contact information across the manipulator's surface. However their implementation faces two main challenges: accurate force estimation across complex surfaces like robotic hands, and integration of these estimates into reactive control loops. We present a data-efficient calibration method that enables rapid, full-array force estimation across varying geometries, providing online feedback that accounts for non-linearities and deformation effects. Our force estimation model serves as feedback in an online closed-loop control system for interaction force tracking. The accuracy of our estimates is independently validated against measurements from a calibrated force-torque sensor. Using the Allegro Hand equipped with Xela uSkin sensors, we demonstrate precise force application through an admittance control loop running at 100Hz, achieving up to 0.12+/-0.08 [N] error margin-results that show promising potential for dexterous manipulation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Adversarial Vulnerabilities of Vision-Language-Action Models in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently in robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a transformative approach, enabling robots to execute complex tasks by integrating visual and linguistic inputs within an end-to-end learning framework. While VLA models offer significant capabilities, they also introduce new attack surfaces, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. With these vulnerabilities largely unexplored, this paper systematically quantifies the robustness of VLA-based robotic systems. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce two untargeted attack objectives that leverage spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, we advance both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for continuously developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.</description>

      <title>WildLMa: Long Horizon Loco-Manipulation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 'In-the-wild' mobile manipulation aims to deploy robots in diverse real-world environments, which requires the robot to (1) have skills that generalize across object configurations; (2) be capable of long-horizon task execution in diverse environments; and (3) perform complex manipulation beyond pick-and-place. Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for extending the workspace and enabling robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) adaptation of learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body teleoperation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or heuristics and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an interface of learned skills that allow LLM planners to coordinate skills for long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate the importance of high-quality training data by achieving higher grasping success rate over existing RL baselines using only tens of demonstrations. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations. Besides extensive quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively demonstrate practical robot applications, such as cleaning up trash in university hallways or outdoor terrains, operating articulated objects, and rearranging items on a bookshelf.</description>

      <title>Spline-FRIDA: Towards Diverse, Humanlike Robot Painting Styles with a Sample-Efficient, Differentiable Brush Stroke Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A painting is more than just a picture on a wall; a painting is a process comprised of many intentional brush strokes, the shapes of which are an important component of a painting's overall style and message. Prior work in modeling brush stroke trajectories either does not work with real-world robotics or is not flexible enough to capture the complexity of human-made brush strokes. In this work, we introduce Spline-FRIDA which can model complex human brush stroke trajectories. This is achieved by recording artists drawing using motion capture, modeling the extracted trajectories with an autoencoder, and introducing a novel brush stroke dynamics model to the existing robotic painting platform FRIDA. We conducted a survey and found that our open-source Spline-FRIDA approach successfully captures the stroke styles in human drawings and that Spline-FRIDA's brush strokes are more human-like, improve semantic planning, and are more artistic compared to existing robot painting systems with restrictive B\'ezier curve strokes.</description>

      <title>GenTact Toolbox: A Computational Design Pipeline to Procedurally Generate Context-Driven 3D Printed Whole-Body Artificial Skins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing whole-body tactile skins for robots remains a challenging task, as existing solutions often prioritize modular, one-size-fits-all designs, which, while versatile, fail to account for the robot's specific shape and the unique demands of its operational context. In this work, we introduce GenTact Toolbox, a computational pipeline for creating versatile whole-body tactile skins tailored to both robot shape and application domain. Our method includes procedural mesh generation for conforming to a robot's topology, task-driven simulation to refine sensor distribution, and multi-material 3D printing for shape-agnostic fabrication. We validate our approach by creating and deploying six capacitive sensing skins on a Franka Research 3 robot arm in a human-robot interaction scenario. This work represents a shift from "one-size-fits-all" tactile sensors toward context-driven, highly adaptable designs that can be customized for a wide range of robotic systems and applications.

      <title>Learning-based Control for Tendon-Driven Continuum Robotic Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for centralized position control of Tendon Driven Continuum Robots (TDCRs) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), with a particular focus on the Sim-to-Real transfer of control policies. The proposed control method employs the Modified Transpose Jacobian (MTJ) control strategy, with its parameters optimally tuned using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Classical model-based controllers encounter significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics of continuum robots. In contrast, model-free control strategies require efficient gain-tuning to handle diverse operational scenarios. This research aims to develop a model-free controller with performance comparable to model-based strategies by integrating an optimal adaptive gain-tuning system. Both simulations and real-world implementations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the trajectory-tracking performance of continuum robots independent of initial conditions and paths within the operational task-space, effectively establishing a task-free controller.</description>

      <title>Mobile-TeleVision: Predictive Motion Priors for Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid robots require both robust lower-body locomotion and precise upper-body manipulation. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches provide whole-body loco-manipulation policies, they lack precise manipulation with high DoF arms. In this paper, we propose decoupling upper-body control from locomotion, using inverse kinematics (IK) and motion retargeting for precise manipulation, while RL focuses on robust lower-body locomotion. We introduce PMP (Predictive Motion Priors), trained with Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to effectively represent upper-body motions. The locomotion policy is trained conditioned on this upper-body motion representation, ensuring that the system remains robust with both manipulation and locomotion. We show that CVAE features are crucial for stability and robustness, and significantly outperforms RL-based whole-body control in precise manipulation. With precise upper-body motion and robust lower-body locomotion control, operators can remotely control the humanoid to walk around and explore different environments, while performing diverse manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-GraspLLM: A Multimodal LLM for Multi-Hand Semantic Guided Grasp Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-hand semantic grasp generation aims to generate feasible and semantically appropriate grasp poses for different robotic hands based on natural language instructions. Although the task is highly valuable, due to the lack of multihand grasp datasets with fine-grained contact description between robotic hands and objects, it is still a long-standing difficult task. In this paper, we present Multi-GraspSet, the first large-scale multi-hand grasp dataset with automatically contact annotations. Based on Multi-GraspSet, we propose Multi-GraspLLM, a unified language-guided grasp generation framework, which leverages large language models (LLM) to handle variable-length sequences, generating grasp poses for diverse robotic hands in a single unified architecture. Multi-GraspLLM first aligns the encoded point cloud features and text features into a unified semantic space. It then generates grasp bin tokens that are subsequently converted into grasp pose for each robotic hand via hand-aware linear mapping. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both real-world experiments and simulator.

      <title>Dream to Manipulate: Compositional World Models Empowering Robot Imitation Learning with Imagination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A world model provides an agent with a representation of its environment, enabling it to predict the causal consequences of its actions. Current world models typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment in front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and hallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world robotics applications. To overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as learnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing digital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real world and its dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional digital twins and world models. DreMa replicates the observed world and its structure by integrating Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, allowing robots to imagine novel configurations of objects and to predict the future consequences of robot actions thanks to its compositionality. We leverage this capability to generate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant transformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across various settings demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data needed to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents. As a highlight, we show that a real Franka Emika Panda robot, powered by DreMa's imagination, can successfully learn novel physical tasks from just a single example per task variation (one-shot policy learning).

      <title>TinySense: A Lighter Weight and More Power-efficient Avionics System for Flying Insect-scale Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce advances in the sensor suite of an autonomous flying insect robot (FIR) weighing less than a gram. FIRs, because of their small weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hovering -- the first level of ``sensor autonomy'' -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 deg, 0.186 m/s, and 0.136 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.</description>

      <title>RoboReflect: A Robotic Reflective Reasoning Framework for Grasping Ambiguous-Condition Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As robotic technology rapidly develops, robots are being employed in an increasing number of fields. However, due to the complexity of deployment environments or the prevalence of ambiguous-condition objects, the practical application of robotics still faces many challenges, leading to frequent errors. Traditional methods and some LLM-based approaches, although improved, still require substantial human intervention and struggle with autonomous error correction in complex scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboReflect, a novel framework leveraging large vision-language models (LVLMs) to enable self-reflection and autonomous error correction in robotic grasping tasks. RoboReflect allows robots to automatically adjust their strategies based on unsuccessful attempts until successful execution is achieved. The corrected strategies are saved in the memory for future task reference. We evaluate RoboReflect through extensive testing on eight common objects prone to ambiguous conditions of three categories. Our results demonstrate that RoboReflect not only outperforms existing grasp pose estimation methods like AnyGrasp and high-level action planning techniques ReKep with GPT-4V but also significantly enhances the robot's capability to adapt and correct errors independently. These findings underscore the critical importance of autonomous self-reflection in robotic systems while effectively addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous-condition environments.</description>

      <title>Universal Actions for Enhanced Embodied Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training on diverse, internet-scale data is a key factor in the success of recent large foundation models. Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-domain data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in a Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic atomic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. The universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward. Our 0.5B instantiation of UniAct outperforms 14X larger SOTA embodied foundation models in extensive evaluations on various real-world and simulation robots, showcasing exceptional cross-embodiment control and adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of adopting universal actions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated the ability to maintain the plasticity of the policy throughout short-term training in aerial robot control. However, these policies have been shown to loss of plasticity when extended to long-term learning in non-stationary environments. For example, the standard proximal policy optimization (PPO) policy is observed to collapse in long-term training settings and lead to significant control performance degradation. To address this problem, this work proposes a cost-aware framework that uses a retrospective cost mechanism (RECOM) to balance rewards and losses in RL training with a non-stationary environment. Using a cost gradient relation between rewards and losses, our framework dynamically updates the learning rate to actively train the control policy in a disturbed wind environment. Our experimental results show that our framework learned a policy for the hovering task without policy collapse in variable wind conditions and has a successful result of 11.29% less dormant units than L2 regularization with PPO.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Collision Avoidance Using Velocity Obstacle-Based Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing safety-critical controllers for acceleration-controlled unicycle robots is challenging, as control inputs may not appear in the constraints of control Lyapunov functions(CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs), leading to invalid controllers. Existing methods often rely on state-feedback-based CLFs and high-order CBFs (HOCBFs), which are computationally expensive to construct and fail to maintain effectiveness in dynamic environments with fast-moving, nearby obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose constructing velocity obstacle-based CBFs (VOCBFs) in the velocity space to enhance dynamic collision avoidance capabilities, instead of relying on distance-based CBFs that require the introduction of HOCBFs. Additionally, by extending VOCBFs using variants of VO, we enable reactive collision avoidance between robots. We formulate a safety-critical controller for acceleration-controlled unicycle robots as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP), integrating state-feedback-based CLFs for navigation and VOCBFs for collision avoidance. To enhance the efficiency of solving the MIQP, we split the MIQP into multiple sub-optimization problems and employ a decision network to reduce computational costs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach effectively guides the robot to its target while avoiding collisions. Compared to HOCBFs, VOCBFs exhibit significantly improved dynamic obstacle avoidance performance, especially when obstacles are fast-moving and close to the robot. Furthermore, we extend our method to distributed multi-robot systems.</description>

      <title>HWC-Loco: A Hierarchical Whole-Body Control Approach to Robust Humanoid Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid robots, capable of assuming human roles in various workplaces, have become essential to the advancement of embodied intelligence. However, as robots with complex physical structures, learning a control model that can operate robustly across diverse environments remains inherently challenging, particularly under the discrepancies between training and deployment environments. In this study, we propose HWC-Loco, a robust whole-body control algorithm tailored for humanoid locomotion tasks. By reformulating policy learning as a robust optimization problem, HWC-Loco explicitly learns to recover from safety-critical scenarios. While prioritizing safety guarantees, overly conservative behavior can compromise the robot's ability to complete the given tasks. To tackle this challenge, HWC-Loco leverages a hierarchical policy for robust control. This policy can dynamically resolve the trade-off between goal-tracking and safety recovery, guided by human behavior norms and dynamic constraints. To evaluate the performance of HWC-Loco, we conduct extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art humanoid control models, demonstrating HWC-Loco's superior performance across diverse terrains, robot structures, and locomotion tasks under both simulated and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>ADMM-MCBF-LCA: A Layered Control Architecture for Safe Real-Time Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of safe real-time navigation of a robot in a dynamic environment with moving obstacles of arbitrary smooth geometries and input saturation constraints. We assume that the robot detects and models nearby obstacle boundaries with a short-range sensor and that this detection is error-free. This problem presents three main challenges: i) input constraints, ii) safety, and iii) real-time computation. To tackle all three challenges, we present a layered control architecture (LCA) consisting of an offline path library generation layer, and an online path selection and safety layer. To overcome the limitations of reactive methods, our offline path library consists of feasible controllers, feedback gains, and reference trajectories. To handle computational burden and safety, we solve online path selection and generate safe inputs that run at 100 Hz. Through simulations on Gazebo and Fetch hardware in an indoor environment, we evaluate our approach against baselines that are layered, end-to-end, or reactive. Our experiments demonstrate that among all algorithms, only our proposed LCA is able to complete tasks such as reaching a goal, safely. When comparing metrics such as safety, input error, and success rate, we show that our approach generates safe and feasible inputs throughout the robot execution.</description>

      <title>TeraSim: Uncovering Unknown Unsafe Events for Autonomous Vehicles through Generative Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers. The code is available at https://github.com/mcity/TeraSim.</description>

      <title>EvidMTL: Evidential Multi-Task Learning for Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Surface Mapping from Monocular RGB Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For scene understanding in unstructured environments, an accurate and uncertainty-aware metric-semantic mapping is required to enable informed action selection by autonomous systems. Existing mapping methods often suffer from overconfident semantic predictions, and sparse and noisy depth sensing, leading to inconsistent map representations. In this paper, we therefore introduce EvidMTL, a multi-task learning framework that uses evidential heads for depth estimation and semantic segmentation, enabling uncertainty-aware inference from monocular RGB images. To enable uncertainty-calibrated evidential multi-task learning, we propose a novel evidential depth loss function that jointly optimizes the belief strength of the depth prediction in conjunction with evidential segmentation loss. Building on this, we present EvidKimera, an uncertainty-aware semantic surface mapping framework, which uses evidential depth and semantics prediction for improved 3D metric-semantic consistency. We train and evaluate EvidMTL on the NYUDepthV2 and assess its zero-shot performance on ScanNetV2, demonstrating superior uncertainty estimation compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable depth estimation and semantic segmentation. In zero-shot mapping tests on ScanNetV2, EvidKimera outperforms Kimera in semantic surface mapping accuracy and consistency, highlighting the benefits of uncertainty-aware mapping and underscoring its potential for real-world robotic applications.</description>

      <title>GSplatVNM: Point-of-View Synthesis for Visual Navigation Models Using Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to image-goal navigation by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with Visual Navigation Models (VNMs), a method we refer to as GSplatVNM. VNMs offer a promising paradigm for image-goal navigation by guiding a robot through a sequence of point-of-view images without requiring metrical localization or environment-specific training. However, constructing a dense and traversable sequence of target viewpoints from start to goal remains a central challenge, particularly when the available image database is sparse. To address these challenges, we propose a 3DGS-based viewpoint synthesis framework for VNMs that synthesizes intermediate viewpoints to seamlessly bridge gaps in sparse data while significantly reducing storage overhead. Experimental results in a photorealistic simulator demonstrate that our approach not only enhances navigation efficiency but also exhibits robustness under varying levels of image database sparsity.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating motion primitives for kinodynamic motion planning using diffusion models. The motions generated by our approach are adapted to each problem instance by utilizing problem-specific parameters, allowing for finding solutions faster and of better quality. The diffusion models used in our approach are trained on randomly cut solution trajectories. These trajectories are created by solving randomly generated problem instances with a kinodynamic motion planner. Experimental results show significant improvements up to 30 percent in both computation time and solution quality across varying robot dynamics such as second-order unicycle or car with trailer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a roadmap to address the current challenges in small-scale testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and robot swarms. The roadmap is a joint effort of participants in the workshop "1st Workshop on Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms," held on June 2 at the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2024 in Jeju, South Korea. The roadmap contains three parts: 1) enhancing accessibility and diversity, especially for underrepresented communities, 2) sharing best practices for the development and maintenance of testbeds, and 3) connecting testbeds through an abstraction layer to support collaboration. The workshop features eight invited speakers, four contributed papers [1]-[4], and a presentation of a survey paper on testbeds [5]. The survey paper provides an online comparative table of more than 25 testbeds, available at https://bassamlab.github.io/testbeds-survey. The workshop's own website is available at https://cpm-remote.lrt.unibw-muenchen.de/iv24-workshop.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Statistical Verification with Imprecise Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14815v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A particularly challenging problem in AI safety is providing guarantees on the behavior of high-dimensional autonomous systems. Verification approaches centered around reachability analysis fail to scale, and purely statistical approaches are constrained by the distributional assumptions about the sampling process. Instead, we pose a distributionally robust version of the statistical verification problem for black-box systems, where our performance guarantees hold over a large family of distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach based on uncertainty quantification using concepts from imprecise probabilities. A central piece of our approach is an ensemble technique called Imprecise Neural Networks, which provides the uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we solve the allied problem of exploring the input set using active learning. The active learning uses an exhaustive neural-network verification tool Sherlock to collect samples. An evaluation on multiple physical simulators in the openAI gym Mujoco environments with reinforcement-learned controllers demonstrates that our approach can provide useful and scalable guarantees for high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines privacy risks in collaborative robotics, focusing on the potential for traffic analysis in encrypted robot communications. While previous research has explored low-level command recovery in teleoperation setups, our work investigates high-level motion recovery from script-based control interfaces. We evaluate the efficacy of prominent website fingerprinting techniques (e.g., Tik-Tok, RF) and their limitations in accurately identifying robotic actions due to their inability to capture detailed temporal relationships. To address this, we introduce a traffic classification approach using signal processing techniques, demonstrating high accuracy in action identification and highlighting the vulnerability of encrypted communications to privacy breaches. Additionally, we explore defenses such as packet padding and timing manipulation, revealing the challenges in balancing traffic analysis resistance with network efficiency. Our findings emphasize the need for continued development of practical defenses in robotic privacy and security.</description>

      <title>Equitable Routing -- Rethinking the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) generalizes the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by introducing multiple salesmen tasked with visiting a set of targets from a single depot, ensuring each target is visited exactly once while minimizing total tour length. A key variant, the min-max MTSP, seeks to balance workloads by minimizing the longest tour among salesmen. However, this problem is challenging to solve optimally due to weak lower bounds from linear relaxations. This paper introduces two novel parametric variants of the MTSP, termed "fair-MTSP". One variant is modeled as a Mixed-Integer Second Order Cone Program (MISOCP), and the other as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Both variants aim to distribute tour lengths equitably among salesmen while minimizing overall costs. We develop algorithms to achieve global optimality for these fair-MTSP variants. We present computational results based on benchmark and real-world scenarios, particularly in electric vehicle fleet management and routing. Furthermore, we also show that the algorithmic approaches presented for the fair-MTSP variants can be directly used to obtain the Pareto-front of a bi-objective optimization problem where one objective focuses on minimizing the total tour length and the other focuses on balancing the tour lengths of the individual tours. The findings support fair-MTSP as a promising alternative to the min-max MTSP, emphasizing fairness in workload distribution.</description>

      <title>An Imitative Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Dogfight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) dogfight, which refers to a fight between two or more UCAVs usually at close quarters, plays a decisive role on the aerial battlefields. With the evolution of artificial intelligence, dogfight progressively transits towards intelligent and autonomous modes. However, the development of autonomous dogfight policy learning is hindered by challenges such as weak exploration capabilities, low learning efficiency, and unrealistic simulated environments. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel imitative reinforcement learning framework, which efficiently leverages expert data while enabling autonomous exploration. The proposed framework not only enhances learning efficiency through expert imitation, but also ensures adaptability to dynamic environments via autonomous exploration with reinforcement learning. Therefore, the proposed framework can learn a successful dogfight policy of 'pursuit-lock-launch' for UCAVs. To support data-driven learning, we establish a dogfight environment based on the Harfang3D sandbox, where we conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that the proposed framework excels in multistage dogfight, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods. Thanks to the ability of imitating experts and autonomous exploration, our framework can quickly learn the critical knowledge in complex aerial combat tasks, achieving up to a 100% success rate and demonstrating excellent robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene comprehension in robotics and autonomous vehicles. Fisheye cameras, known for their wide field of view, have inherent geometric benefits. However, their use in depth estimation is restricted by a scarcity of ground truth data and image distortions. We present FisheyeDepth, a self-supervised depth estimation model tailored for fisheye cameras. We incorporate a fisheye camera model into the projection and reprojection stages during training to handle image distortions, thereby improving depth estimation accuracy and training stability. Furthermore, we incorporate real-scale pose information into the geometric projection between consecutive frames, replacing the poses estimated by the conventional pose network. Essentially, this method offers the necessary physical depth for robotic tasks, and also streamlines the training and inference procedures. Additionally, we devise a multi-channel output strategy to improve robustness by adaptively fusing features at various scales, which reduces the noise from real pose data. We demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our model in fisheye image depth estimation through evaluations on public datasets and real-world scenarios.

      <title>CaRtGS: Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting SLAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00486v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is pivotal in robotics, with photorealistic scene reconstruction emerging as a key challenge. To address this, we introduce Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting SLAM (CaRtGS), a novel method enhancing the efficiency and quality of photorealistic scene reconstruction in real-time environments. Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), CaRtGS achieves superior rendering quality and processing speed, which is crucial for scene photorealistic reconstruction. Our approach tackles computational misalignment in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (GS-SLAM) through an adaptive strategy that enhances optimization iterations, addresses long-tail optimization, and refines densification. Experiments on Replica, TUM-RGBD, and VECtor datasets demonstrate CaRtGS's effectiveness in achieving high-fidelity rendering with fewer Gaussian primitives. This work propels SLAM towards real-time, photorealistic dense rendering, significantly advancing photorealistic scene representation. For the benefit of the research community, we release the code and accompanying videos on our project website: https://dapengfeng.github.io/cartgs.</description>

      <title>Open-Vocabulary Online Semantic Mapping for SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an Open-Vocabulary Online 3D semantic mapping pipeline, that we denote by its acronym OVO. Given a sequence of posed RGB-D frames, we detect and track 3D segments, which we describe using CLIP vectors. These are computed from the viewpoints where they are observed by a novel CLIP merging method. Notably, our OVO has a significantly lower computational and memory footprint than offline baselines, while also showing better segmentation metrics than them. Along with superior segmentation performance, we also show experimental results of our mapping contributions integrated with two different SLAM backbones (Gaussian-SLAM and ORB-SLAM2), being the first ones demonstrating end-to-end open-vocabulary online 3D reconstructions without relying on ground-truth camera poses or scene geometry.</description>

      <title>Fast LiDAR Data Generation with Rectified Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building LiDAR generative models holds promise as powerful data priors for restoration, scene manipulation, and scalable simulation in autonomous mobile robots. In recent years, approaches using diffusion models have emerged, significantly improving training stability and generation quality. Despite their success, diffusion models require numerous iterations of running neural networks to generate high-quality samples, making the increasing computational cost a potential barrier for robotics applications. To address this challenge, this paper presents R2Flow, a fast and high-fidelity generative model for LiDAR data. Our method is based on rectified flows that learn straight trajectories, simulating data generation with significantly fewer sampling steps compared to diffusion models. We also propose an efficient Transformer-based model architecture for processing the image representation of LiDAR range and reflectance measurements. Our experiments on unconditional LiDAR data generation using the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both efficiency and quality.</description>

      <title>PriorMotion: Generative Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Raster-Vector Motion Field Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable spatial and motion perception is essential for safe autonomous navigation. Recently, class-agnostic motion prediction on bird's-eye view (BEV) cell grids derived from LiDAR point clouds has gained significant attention. However, existing frameworks typically perform cell classification and motion prediction on a per-pixel basis, neglecting important motion field priors such as rigidity constraints, temporal consistency, and future interactions between agents. These limitations lead to degraded performance, particularly in sparse and distant regions. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{PriorMotion}, an innovative generative framework designed for class-agnostic motion prediction that integrates essential motion priors by modeling them as distributions within a structured latent space. Specifically, our method captures structured motion priors using raster-vector representations and employs a variational autoencoder with distinct dynamic and static components to learn future motion distributions in the latent space. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that \textbf{PriorMotion} outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both traditional metrics and our newly proposed evaluation criteria. Notably, we achieve improvements of approximately 15.24\% in accuracy for fast-moving objects, an 3.59\% increase in generalization, a reduction of 0.0163 in motion stability, and a 31.52\% reduction in prediction errors in distant regions. Further validation on FMCW LiDAR sensors confirms the robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>SafeAgentBench: A Benchmark for Safe Task Planning of Embodied LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to understand and plan complicated natural language instructions. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs' safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap, we present SafeAgentBench-the first benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10\% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness. More details and code are available at https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench.</description>

      <title>CAD-Assistant: Tool-Augmented VLLMs as Generic CAD Task Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose CAD-Assistant, a general-purpose CAD agent for AI-assisted design. Our approach is based on a powerful Vision and Large Language Model (VLLM) as a planner and a tool-augmentation paradigm using CAD-specific tools. CAD-Assistant addresses multimodal user queries by generating actions that are iteratively executed on a Python interpreter equipped with the FreeCAD software, accessed via its Python API. Our framework is able to assess the impact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions based on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of CAD-specific tools including a sketch image parameterizer, rendering modules, a 2D cross-section generator, and other specialized routines. CAD-Assistant is evaluated on multiple CAD benchmarks, where it outperforms VLLM baselines and supervised task-specific methods. Beyond existing benchmarks, we qualitatively demonstrate the potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as general-purpose CAD solvers across diverse workflows.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Collision Detection via Vertex Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collision detection is a critical functionality for robotics. The degree to which objects collide cannot be represented as a continuously differentiable function for any shapes other than spheres. This paper proposes a framework for handling collision detection between polyhedral shapes. We frame the signed distance between two polyhedral bodies as the optimal value of a convex optimization, and consider constraining the signed distance in a bilevel optimization problem. To avoid relying on specialized bilevel solvers, our method exploits the fact that the signed distance is the minimal point of a convex region related to the two bodies. Our method enumerates the values obtained at all extreme points of this region and lists them as constraints in the higher-level problem. We compare our formulation to existing methods in terms of reliability and speed when solved using the same mixed complementarity problem solver. We demonstrate that our approach more reliably solves difficult collision detection problems with multiple obstacles than other methods, and is faster than existing methods in some cases.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Sim-to-Real Methods in RL: Progress, Prospects and Challenges with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been explored and verified to be effective in solving decision-making tasks in various domains, such as robotics, transportation, recommender systems, etc. It learns from the interaction with environments and updates the policy using the collected experience. However, due to the limited real-world data and unbearable consequences of taking detrimental actions, the learning of RL policy is mainly restricted within the simulators. This practice guarantees safety in learning but introduces an inevitable sim-to-real gap in terms of deployment, thus causing degraded performance and risks in execution. There are attempts to solve the sim-to-real problems from different domains with various techniques, especially in the era with emerging techniques such as large foundations or language models that have cast light on the sim-to-real. This survey paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first taxonomy that formally frames the sim-to-real techniques from key elements of the Markov Decision Process (State, Action, Transition, and Reward). Based on the framework, we cover comprehensive literature from the classic to the most advanced methods including the sim-to-real techniques empowered by foundation models, and we also discuss the specialties that are worth attention in different domains of sim-to-real problems. Then we summarize the formal evaluation process of sim-to-real performance with accessible code or benchmarks. The challenges and opportunities are also presented to encourage future exploration of this direction. We are actively maintaining a repository to include the most up-to-date sim-to-real research work to help domain researchers.</description>

      <title>OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</description>
