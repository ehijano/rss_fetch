      <title>Fiduciary Duty in the Municipal Bonds Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine whether the imposition of fiduciary duty on municipal advisors affects bond yields and advising fees. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, I show that bond yields reduce by $\sim$9\% after the imposition of the SEC Municipal Advisor Rule due to lower underwriting spreads. Larger municipalities are more likely to recruit advisors after the rule is effective and experience a greater reduction in yields. However, smaller issuers do not experience a reduction in offering yields after the SEC Rule. Instead, their borrowing cost increases if their primary advisor exits the market. Using novel hand-collected data, I find that the average advising fees paid by issuers does not increase after the regulation. Overall, my results suggest that while fiduciary duty may mitigate the principal-agent problem between some issuers and advisors, there is heterogeneity among issuers.</description>

      <title>Does Peer-Reviewed Research Help Predict Stock Returns?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10317v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mining 29,000 accounting ratios for t-statistics over 2.0 leads to cross-sectional return predictability similar to the peer review process. For both methods, about 50% of predictability remains after the original sample periods. Predictors supported by peer-reviewed risk explanations or equilibrium models underperform other predictors post-sample, suggesting peer review systematically mislabels mispricing as risk, though only 20% of predictors are labelled as risk. Data mining generates other features of peer review including the rise in returns as original sample periods end and the speed of post-sample decay. It also uncovers themes like investment, issuance, and accruals -- decades before they are published.</description>
