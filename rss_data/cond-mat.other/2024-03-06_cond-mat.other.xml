      <title>Novel Dipole-Lattice coupling in the Quantum-Spin-Liquid Material $\kappa$-Cu-CN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of molecular Mott insulators on triangular lattice provided a few S=1/2 triangular quantum spin liquid candidates, with $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ being the most studied material of this group. The large number experimental work presented a conflicting set of evidence, some suggesting spin liquid behavior, while other pointing on deceased magnetization reminding of a valence bond solid with orphan spins. In this work we use Raman scattering spectroscopy to probe both local charge on molecular sites and lattice phonons as a function of temperature down to 6K. Based on the analysis of the increasing width of Gaussian line shape of the BEDT-TTF charge sensitive vibration $\nu_2$ on colling below 40 K we suggest a development of disordered fluctuating charge disproportionation on (BEDT-TTF)$_2$ dimers of amplitude as small as 0.06$e$. The lattice phonons show strong anomalous broadening on cooling only in (c,c) scattering channel, associated with the developing charge disproportionation. We suggest an interpretation, where the coupling of disordered charge dipoles on dimers to the lattice results in anisotropic modulation of charge transfer integrals between dimer lattice sites. Such fluctuation would results in fluctuations of magnetic coupling between spins which can produce short lived charge ordered spin-singlet pairs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Physics Calculations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. We demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, LLMs can accurately carry out key calculations in research papers in theoretical physics. We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics: the Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving approximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry out the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that break down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders for problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing the calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating that, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases. Aggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out of 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the requisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in quantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two primary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from papers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation steps, demonstrating good results in both cases. The strong performance is the first step for developing algorithms that automatically explore theoretical hypotheses at an unprecedented scale.</description>
