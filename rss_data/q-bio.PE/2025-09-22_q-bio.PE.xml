      <title>Epidemic amplification by correlated superspreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infectious pathogens often propagate by superspreading, which focusses onward transmission on disproportionately few infected individuals. At the same time, infector-infectee pairs tend to have more similar transmission potentials than expected by chance, as risk factors assort among individuals who frequently interact. A key problem for infectious disease epidemiology, and in the dynamics of complex systems, is to understand how structured variation in individual transmission will scale to impact epidemic dynamics. Here we introduce a framework that reveals how population structure shapes epidemic thresholds, through autocorrelation of individual reproductive numbers along chains of transmission. We show that chains of superspreading can sustain epidemics even when the average transmission rate in the host population is below one, and derive a mathematical threshold beyond which correlated superspreading allows epidemics in otherwise subcritical systems. Empirical analysis of 47 transmission trees for 13 human pathogens indicate self-organizing bursts of superspreading are common and that many trees are near the critical boundary. Vaccination campaigns that proceed up assortative hierarchies of transmission are predicted to sustain the force of infection until herd immunity is reached, providing a mechanistic basis for threshold dynamics observed in real-world settings. Conversely, modulating correlations in transmission, rather than mean or variance, could enable cities and other complex systems to develop immune-like capacities that suppress contagion while preserving core functions.</description>

      <title>A Visual Discrete Event-based Simulator for Protection of Plants against Herbivores Employed as Computational Optimization Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants come with sophisticated strategies to survive within a highly competing environment. In addition, they need to resist frequent attacks from a variety of herbivores acting alone, in small groups, or in swarms. Since the amount of energy a plant might invest in defense and reproduction is limited, a complex optimization problem emerges. In a shared habitat, plants fight herbivores by shape and camouflage, by the release of specific toxins, or by attracting predators of herbivores. Furthermore, plants alert their surrounding field by signaling substances in the event of an assault. Transported by air or through a network of roots, signaling substances reach neighbors to trigger their defense. The offsprings of a plant commonly grow within a certain distance to benefit from symbiotic protection. We introduce a grid-based visual simulation software for detailed configuration and subsequent processing of the behavior of the resulting system in time and space. In terms of solution to a computational optimization problem inspired by nature, settings with low energy need and long life able to cope with different patterns of attack can be figured out and analyzed. Applications include novel techniques for efficient construction and secure operation of sensor networks.</description>

      <title>The evolution of asymmetrical regulation of physiology is central to aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolutionary biology of aging is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of aging and how to develop anti-aging treatments. Thus far most evolutionary theory concerns the genetics of aging with limited physiological integration. Here we present an intuitive evolutionary framework built on how physiology is regulated and how this regulation itself is then predicted to age. Life has evolved to secure reproduction and avoid system failure in early life, and it is the physiological regulation that evolves in response to those early life selection pressures that leads to the emergence of aging. Importantly, asymmetrical regulation of physiology will evolve as the Darwinian fitness costs of loss of regulation will not be symmetrical. When asymmetrical regulatory systems break during aging, they cause physiological function to drift towards the physiological range where costs of dysregulation are lowest, rendering aging directional. Our model explains many puzzling aspects of the biology of aging. These include why aging appears (but is not) programmed, why aging is gradual yet heterogeneous, why cellular and hormonal signaling are closely related to aging, the compensation law of mortality, why trade-offs between reproduction and aging remain elusive, why longer-lived organisms show more signs of aging during their natural lifespans, and why longer-lived organisms can be less responsive to treatments of aging that work well in short-lived organisms. We provide predictions of our theory that are empirically testable. By incorporating physiological regulation into evolutionary models of aging, we provide a novel perspective to guide empirical research in this still growing field.</description>

      <title>A Unified and Predictive Measure of Functional Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the critical role of functional diversity (FD) in understanding ecological systems and processes, its robust quantification remains a significant challenge. A long-held view in the field is that it is not possible to capture its three facets -- functional richness, functional divergence, and functional evenness -- in a single index. This perspective has prompted recent proposals for FD measurement to use three separate indices, one for each aspect. Here, we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that the probability-weighted Vendi Score (pVS), first introduced by Friedman and Dieng (2023), can serve as a powerful functional diversity index that can capture its three facets. We adapt pVS to functional ecology by defining it as the exponential of the R\'enyi entropy of the eigenvalues of the abundance-weighted trait similarity matrix. This formulation allows pVS to be applicable at any biological level. It can be defined at the species level, at which most existing FD metrics are defined, and at the individual level to naturally incorporate intraspecific trait variation (ITV) when detailed data are available. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the robustness of pVS. We first mathematically prove it satisfies several essential desiderata for FD metrics, including invariance to functional redundancy, set monotonicity, distance monotonicity, and concavity. We then show that pVS consistently exhibits the expected ground-truth behavior on simulated ecosystem scenarios under which many FD metrics fail. By integrating abundances and trait similarities within a single, theoretically sound framework, pVS provides a generally applicable index for ecology.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.</description>
