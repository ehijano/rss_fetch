      <title>Efficient Stochastic Template Bank using Inner Product Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave searches are crucial for studying compact sources like neutron stars and black holes. Many sensitive modeled searches use matched filtering to compare gravitational strain data to a set of waveform models known as template banks. We introduce a new stochastic placement method for constructing template banks, offering efficiency and flexibility to handle arbitrary parameter spaces, including orbital eccentricity, tidal deformability, and other extrinsic parameters. This method can be computationally limited by the ability to compare proposal templates with the accepted templates in the bank. To alleviate this computational load, we introduce the use of inner product inequalities to reduce the number of required comparisons. We also introduce a novel application of Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to enhance waveform coverage in sparser regions. Our approach has been employed to search for eccentric binary neutron stars, low-mass neutron stars, primordial black holes, supermassive black hole binaries. We demonstrate that our method produces self-consistent banks that recover the required minimum fraction of signals. For common parameter spaces, our method shows comparable computational performance and similar template bank sizes to geometric placement methods and stochastic methods, while easily extending to higher-dimensional problems. The time to run a search exceeds the time to generate the bank by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ for dedicated template banks, such as geometric, mass-only stochastic, and aligned spin cases, $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ for eccentric and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ for the tidal deformable bank. With the advent of efficient template bank generation, the primary area for improvement is developing more efficient search methodologies.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Galactic Center PeVatron Beyond 100 TeV with HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an observation of ultra-high energy (UHE) gamma rays from the Galactic Center region, using seven years of data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. The HAWC data are best described as a point-like source (HAWC J1746-2856) with a power-law spectrum ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}E=\phi(E/26 \,\text{TeV})^{\gamma}$), where $\gamma=-2.88 \pm 0.15_{\text{stat}} - 0.1_{\text{sys}} $ and $\phi=1.5 \times 10^{-15}$ (TeV cm$^{2}$s)$^{-1}$ $\pm\, 0.3_{\text{stat}}\,^{+0.08_{\text{sys}}}_{-0.13_{\text{sys}}}$ extending from 6 to 114 TeV. We find no evidence of a spectral cutoff up to $100$ TeV using HAWC data. Two known point-like gamma-ray sources are spatially coincident with the HAWC gamma-ray excess: Sgr A$^{*}$ (HESS J1745-290) and the Arc (HESS J1746-285). We subtract the known flux contribution of these point sources from the measured flux of HAWC J1746-2856 to exclude their contamination and show that the excess observed by HAWC remains significant ($&gt;$5$\sigma$) with the spectrum extending to $&gt;$100 TeV. Our result supports that these detected UHE gamma rays can originate via hadronic interaction of PeV cosmic-ray protons with the dense ambient gas and confirms the presence of a proton PeVatron at the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a dusty yellow supergiant progenitor for the Type IIb SN 2017gkk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type IIb supernovae are important subclass of stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe), which show H lines only at early times. Their progenitors are believed to contain a low-mass H envelope before explosion. This work reports the discovery of a progenitor candidate in pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope images for the Type IIb SN~2017gkk. With detailed analysis of its spectral energy distribution and local environment, we suggest that the progenitor is most likely a yellow supergiant with significant circumstellar extinction and has an initial mass of about 16 $M_\odot$, effective temperature log($T_{\rm eff}/K)=3.72\pm0.08$ and luminosity log($L/L_{\odot})=5.17\pm0.04$. This progenitor is not massive enough to strip envelope through stellar wind, and it supports an interacting binary progenitor channel and adds to the growing list of direct progenitor detections for Type~IIb SNe. Future late-time observations will confirm whether this progenitor candidate has disappeared and reveal the putative binary companion that has survived the explosion.</description>

      <title>Determining the viewing angle from TeV light curve of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most powerful explosive events in the universe. LHAASO recently observed the most luminous one: GRB 221009A, and unveiled its TeV light curve. The light curve exhibits a distinct jet break at around 670 seconds, enabling the derivation of the viewing angle based on the smoothness of the jet break. We constructed two models with or without considering the high-latitude radiation, where the viewing angle was treated as a free parameter, to fit the TeV light curve. We obtained the viewing angles being 9.4 $\times 10^{-4}$ radians and 5.9 $\times 10^{-3}$ radians, respectively. These values closely resemble an on-axis scenario, given the opening angle is 1.4 $\times 10^{-2}$ radians.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Temperature Ratio in Transrelativistic Unmagnetized Shock Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly magnetized shock waves are paramount to a large diversity of environments, including supernova remnants, blazars, and binary-neutron-star mergers. Understanding the distribution of energy between electrons and ions within these astrophysical shock waves spanning a wide spectrum of velocities is a long-standing challenge. In this study, we present a unified model for the downstream electron temperature within unmagnetized shock waves. Encompassing velocities from Newtonian to relativistic, we probe regimes representative of the gradual deceleration of the forward shock in the late gamma-ray burst afterglow phase, such as GRB 170817A. In our model, heating results from an ambipolar electric field generated by the difference in inertia between electrons and ions, coupled with rapid electron scattering in the decelerating turbulence. Our findings demonstrate that the electron temperature consistently represents $10\%$ of the incoming ion kinetic energy in the shock front frame over the full range of shock velocities.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Signatures of Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes with Circumbinary Disks in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black holes may have circumbinary disks if formed through common-envelope evolution or within gaseous environments. Disks can drive binaries into wider and more eccentric orbits, while gravitational waves harden and circularise them. We combine cutting-edge evolution prescriptions for disk-driven binaries with well-known equations for gravitational-wave-driven evolution, and study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that binaries are driven by their disk to an equilibrium eccentricity, $0.2\lesssim e_\mathrm{eq} \lesssim0.5$, that dominates their evolution. Once they transition to the GW-dominated regime their eccentricity decreases rapidly; we find that binaries with long-lived disks will likely be observed in LISA with detectable eccentricities $\sim 10^{-2}$ at $0.01$ Hz, with the precise value closely correlating with the binary's initial mass ratio. This may lead binary black holes with CBDs observed in LISA to be confused with dynamically-formed binary black holes.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the 2.4 hr-period eclipsing cataclysmic variable W2 in 47 Tuc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: W2 (CXOGlb J002415.8-720436) is a cataclysmic variable (CV) in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Its modulation was discovered within the CATS@BAR project. The source shows all the properties of magnetic CVs, but whether it is a polar or an intermediate polar is still a matter of debate. This paper investigates the spectral and temporal properties of the source, using all archival X-ray data from Chandra and eROSITA Early Data Release, to establish whether the source falls within the category of polars or intermediate polars. We fitted Chandra archival spectra with three different models: a power law, a bremsstrahlung and an optically thin thermal plasma. We also explored the temporal properties of the source with searches for pulsations with a power spectral density analysis and a Rayleigh test ($Z_n^2$). W2 displays a mean luminosity of $\sim 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over a 20-year span, despite lower values in a few epochs. The source is not detected in the latest observation, taken with Chandra in 2022, and we infer an X-ray luminosity $\leq 7 \times 10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The source spectral shape does not change over time and can be equally well fitted with each of the three models, with a best-fit photon index of 1.6 for the power law and best-fit temperatures of 10 keV for both the bremsstrahlung and the thermal plasma models. We confirm the previously detected period of 8649 s, ascribed to the binary orbital period, and found a cycle-to-cycle variability associated with this periodicity. No other significant pulsation is detected. Considering the source orbital period, luminosity, spectral characteristics, long-term evolution and strong cycle-to-cycle variability, we suggest that W2 is a magnetic CV of the polar type.</description>

      <title>Expected insights on type Ia supernovae from LISA's gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of progenitors of type Ia supernovae have long been debated, primarily due to the elusiveness of the progenitor systems to traditional electromagnetic observation methods. We argue that gravitational wave observations with the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) offer the most promising way to test one of the leading progenitor scenarios - the double-degenerate scenario, which involves a binary system of two white dwarf stars. In this study, we review published results, supplementing them with additional calculations for the context of type Ia supernovae. We discuss that LISA will be able to provide a complete sample of double white dwarf type Ia supernova progenitors with orbital period less than 16-11 minutes (gravitational wave frequencies above 2-3 milli-Hertz). Such a sample will enable a statistical validation of the double-degenerate scenario by simply counting whether LISA detects enough double white dwarf binaries to account the measured type Ia merger rate in Milky Way-like galaxies. Additionally, we illustrate how LISA's capability to measure the chirp mass will set lower bounds on the primary mass, revealing whether detected double white dwarf binaries will eventually result in a type Ia supernova. We estimate that the expected LISA constraints on the type Ia merger rate for the Milky Way will be 4-9%. We also discuss the potential gravitational wave signal from a type Ia supernova assuming a double detonation mechanism and explore how multi-messenger observations could significantly advance our understanding of these transient phenomena.</description>

      <title>Formation of neutron stars inside planetary nebulae via accretion-induced collapse and core-merger-induced collapse from white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, I demonstrate the possible formation channel for neutron stars (NSs) via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) composition white dwarfs (WDs) inside planetary nebulae (PNe; also so-called symbiotic nebulae). A heavy mass loss via the stellar wind or during the the roche-lobe overfilling (RLOF) mass-transfer may happen at the late evolutionary phase of ONeMg WD - red giant (or asymptotic giant branch) star binaries, and it might form nebulae with central accreting WD binaries. The nebulae might be ionized the hot cores of giant stars or accreting WDs. Therefore, the accreting WD inside the symbiotic nebulae might grow in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit mass and collapse. Peculiar NSs born via the AIC of WDs inside the symbiotic nebulae (PNe) may finally have WD companions and become the NS-WD systems, and the Milky Way may contain tens of such kind of systems. Second, I introduce another possibility for the formation of PNe (or pulsar wind nebulae) with newborn NS via the core-merger-induced collapse during the common envelope evolution of ONeMg WD binaries.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent theory of cosmic ray penetration into molecular clouds: relativistic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study penetration of interstellar cosmic rays (CRs) into molecular clouds surrounded by nonuniform diffuse envelopes. The present work generalizes our earlier model of CR self-modulation (Ivlev et al. 2018, Dogiel et al. 2018), in which the value for the envelope's gas density where CRs excite MHD waves was treated as a free parameter. Now, we investigate the case where the density monotonically increases toward the center. Assuming that CRs are relativistic, we obtain a universal analytical solution which does not depend on the particular shape of gas distribution in the envelope, and self-consistently derive boundaries of the diffusion zone formed within the envelope, where CRs are scattered at the self-excited waves. The values of the gas density at the boundaries are found to be substantially smaller than those assumed in the earlier model, which leads to a significantly stronger modulation of penetrating CRs. We compute the impact of CR self-modulation on the gamma-ray emission, and show that the results of our theoretical model are in excellent agreement with recent observations of nearby giant molecular clouds by Yang et al. (2023).</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst prompt emission from the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons in a rapidly decaying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation from accelerated electrons above the photosphere of a relativistic ejecta is a natural candidate for the dominant process for the prompt GRB emission. There is however a tension between the predicted low-energy spectral index $\alpha=-3/2$ in the fast cooling regime and observations. Radiating electrons have time to travel away from their acceleration site and may experience an evolving magnetic field. To study the impact on the synchrotron spectrum, we compute the radiation from electrons in a decaying magnetic field, including adiabatic cooling, synchrotron radiation, IC scatterings and pair production. We explore the physical conditions in the comoving frame of the emission region and focus on the fast cooling regime where the radiative timescale of electrons with a Lorentz factor $\Gamma_{m}$ responsible for the peak of the emission, $t_{syn}(\Gamma_{m})$, is much shorter than the dynamical timescale $t_{dyn}$. We find that the effect depends on the decay characteristic timescale $t_{B}$: (i) for a slow decay with $t_{B}\gtrsim 10 t_{syn}(\Gamma_{m})$, the effect is very weak and the spectral shape is mostly determined by the impact of the IC scatterings on the electron cooling, leading to $-3/2\le \alpha\le -1$; (ii) for a fast decay with $0.1 t_{syn}(\Gamma_{m})\lesssim t_{B}\lesssim 10 t_{syn}(\Gamma_{m})$, the magnetic field decay has a strong impact, leading naturally to the synchrotron marginally fast cooling regime, where $\alpha$ tends to $-2/3$ while the radiative efficiency remains high. The high energy IC component is enhanced in this regime ; (iii) for an even faster decay, the whole electron population is slow cooling. We conclude that efficient synchrotron radiation in a rapidly decaying magnetic field can reproduce low-energy photon indices ranging from $\alpha=-3/2$ to $-2/3$, in agreement with the measured value in the majority of GRB spectra.</description>

      <title>A Parameter Study of the Electromagnetic Signatures of an Analytical Mini-Disk Model for Supermassive Binary Black Hole Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to be located at the centers of most galactic nuclei. When galaxies merge they form supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) systems and these central SMBHs will also merge at later times, producing gravitational waves (GWs). Because galaxy mergers are likely gas-rich environments, SMBHBs are also potential sources of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The EM signatures depend on gas dynamics, orbital dynamics, and radiation processes. The gas dynamics are governed by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in a time-dependent spacetime. Numerically solving the MHD equations for a time-dependent binary spacetime is computationally expensive. Therefore, it is challenging to conduct a full exploration of the parameter space of these systems and the resulting EM signatures. We have developed an analytical accretion disk model for the mini-disks of an SMBHB system and produced images and light curves using a general relativistic ray-tracing code and a superimposed harmonic binary black hole metric. This analytical model greatly reduces the time and computational resources needed to explore these systems, while incorporating some key information from simulations. We present a parameter space exploration of the SMBHB system in which we have studied the dependence of the EM signatures on the spins of the black holes (BHs), the mass ratio, the accretion rate, the viewing angle, and the initial binary separation. Additionally, we study how the commonly used fast-light approximation affects the EM signatures and evaluate its validity in GRMHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational self-lensing of Fast Radio Bursts in neutron star magnetospheres: I. The model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are cosmological sub-second bursts of coherent radio emission, whose source is still unknown. To date, the galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 is the only astrophysical object known to emit radio bursts akin to FRBs, albeit less powerful, supporting suggestions that FRBs originate from magnetars. Many remarkable properties of FRBs, e.g. the dichotomy between repeaters and one-off sources, and their power-law energy distributions (with typical index $\sim 2-3$), are not well understood yet. Moreover, the huge radio power released by the most active repeaters is challenging even for the magnetic energy reservoir of magnetars. Here we assume that FRBs originate from co-rotating hot-spots anchored in neutron star magnetospheres and get occasionally amplified by large factors via gravitational self-lensing in the strong NS field. We evaluate the probability of amplification and show that (i) a power-law energy distribution of events $\propto E^{-(2- 3)}$ is generally expected, (ii) all FRB sources may be regarded as repeating, their appearance as one-off sources or repeaters being determined by the critical dependence of the amplification probability on the emission geometry and source orientation relative to Earth and (iii) the most active repeaters, in particular, correspond to extremely rare and finely-tuned orientations ($\sim$ one in $10^6$), leading to large probabilities of amplification which make their bursts frequently detectable. At the same time, their power release appears enhanced, typically by factors $\gtrsim 10$, easing their energy budget problem.</description>

      <title>Simulating FRB Morphologies and Coherent Phase Correlation Signatures from Multi-Plane Astrophysical Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), like pulsars, display radio emission from compact regions such that they can be treated as point sources. As this radiation propagates through space, they encounter sources of lensing such as a gravitational field of massive objects or inhomogeneous changes in the electron density of cold plasma. We have developed a simulation tool to generate these lensing morphologies through coherent propagation transfer functions generated by phase coherent geometric optics on a spatial grid. In the limit an FRB can be treated as a point source, the ray paths from the FRB to the observer are phase coherent. Each image will have a time delay and magnification that will alter the emitted frequency-temporal morphology of the FRB to that which is observed. The interference of these images could also decohere the observed phase properties of the images, affecting any phase related searches such as searching for the auto-correlation of the observed FRB voltage with other images in time. We present analytic test cases to demonstrate that the simulation can model qualitative properties. We provide example multi-plane lensing systems to show the capabilities of the simulation in modeling the lensed morphology of an FRB and observed phase coherence.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization: A view deep inside cosmic ray driven turbulence and particle acceleration in supernova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show here that highly polarized X-ray synchrotron radiation from young supernova remnants (SNRs) can be modeled within the framework of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and nonlinear magnetic turbulence generation.Cosmic ray acceleration by SNR shocks to very high energies requires efficient magnetic turbulence amplification in the shock precursor.As the strong turbulence generated by Bell's instability far upstream from the viscous subshock convects through the subshock, nonlinear dynamical effects on the compressible fluctuations produce a downstream layer filled with strong anisotropic turbulence with predominantly radial magnetic fields.The synchrotron radiation from shock accelerated electrons in the turbulent downstream layer has a high degree of polarization shown to be consistent with recent observations of young SNRs by IXPE.In the case of Tycho's SNR, the measured X-ray radiation constrains the thickness of the energy containing interval and the amplitude of cosmic ray driven magnetic turbulence, as well as the maximal energy of accelerated protons.The preferential direction of the X-ray polarization depends sensitively on the SNR shock velocity and the ambient density.A unique feature of our model is the sensitive dependence of the degree and direction of X-ray polarization on the spatial overlap between regions of amplified magnetic turbulence and TeV electron populations.While this overlap occurs on scales orders of magnitude below the resolution of IXPE,its polarization measurement allows testing of turbulent plasma processes on unprecedented scales.The mechanism of formation of highly polarized X-ray synchrotron radiation in fast shocks with high level of anisotropic turbulent magnetic field preferentially directed along the shock normal may be applied to other systems like shocks produced by black hole jets.</description>

      <title>Hadronuclear interactions in AGN jets as the origin of the diffuse high-energy neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of diffuse high-energy neutrinos from TeV to PeV energies detected by IceCube Observatory remains a mystery. In our previous work, we have shown that hadronuclear (p-p) interactions in AGN jets could be important and generate detectable very-high-energy emissions. Here, we further explore these interactions in the AGN jets based on their luminosity function. The diffuse neutrino flux and corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux have been calculated and compared with observational data. In our modeling, two beaming patterns are considered separately. To make sure that the corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux does not overshoot the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background, we find that if the neutrino production region in jet is opaque to $\gamma$ rays, p-p interactions in AGN jets with a small viewing angle (the blazar case) are able to interpret the PeV neutrino background. Similarly, AGN jets with a large viewing angle (the radio galaxy case) may interpret the TeV neutrino background. While, if the neutrino production region is transparent to $\gamma$ rays, only blazars have the potential to interpret the DNB around PeV band. Some caveats are also discussed.</description>

      <title>NICER timing of the X-ray thermal isolated neutron star RX J0806.4--4123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray thermal isolated neutron star (XTINS) RX J0806.4--4123 shows interesting multiwavelength properties that seemingly deviate from those of similar neutron stars. An accurate determination of the spin frequency change over time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4-4123's properties in comparison to those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we carried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4-4123 with the NICER instrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the $Z_K^2$ test for phase-connecting separate observations and finding a timing solution for the entire dataset. We also developed a simple and universal method for estimating the uncertainties of frequency $\nu$ and its derivative $\dot{\nu}$ from the empirical dependencies of $Z_K^2$ on trial values of these parameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency. Applying this method, we determined a spin-down rate $\dot{\nu} = -7.3(1.2)\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm Hz\, s}^{-1}$. The resulting spin-down power $\dot{E}=2.6\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it is a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX J0806.4-4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured $\dot{E}$ in general.</description>

      <title>The Nature of the High-energy Gamma-Ray Radiation Associated with the High-redshift Blazar B3 1343+451</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift blazars are the most powerful extragalactic astrophysical sources ever detected in the high-energy gamma-ray band. In this study, we present a temporal and spectral analysis of the high-redshift blazar B3 1343+451 based on 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations, spanning from 2008 August 4 to 2022 June 6 (MJD 54686-59733). We extract a seven-day binned $\gamma$-ray light curve in the energy range 0.1--500 GeV and identify seven outburst periods with a peak flux of $&gt;4.32\times10^{-7} \rm ph \cdot cm^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}$. The highest seven day flux (above 100 MeV) reaches $(8.06\pm0.56)\times10^{-7} \rm erg \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}$ on MJD = 56,177.16, which is 10 times higher than the flux in the quiescent period. To understand the properties of distant blazar jets, we employ a standard one-zone leptonic scenario and model the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of one quiescent and seven flaring periods. We find that the $\gamma$-ray spectrum is better reproduced if we assume that the dissipation region of the jet, $R_{\rm diss}$, is located within the molecular torus, where infrared emission is the dominant external photon field. We infer that the jets in higher-redshift blazars have larger power and kinetic energy, where the kinetic energy is significantly greater than the radiation power, and the jet production efficiency suggests that we need to lower the accretion efficiency. These results imply that B3 1343+451 may have a standard thin disk surrounding its massive black hole, and the jets of B3 1343+451 may not be fully explained by the Blandford--Payne process.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Mass of the Black Hole and Possible Wind Outflow of the Accretion Disk in the Tidal Disruption Event AT2021ehb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can potentially probe low-mass black holes in host galaxies that might not adhere to bulge or stellar-dispersion relationships. At least initially, TDEs can also reveal super-Eddington accretion. X-ray spectroscopy can potentially constrain black hole masses, and reveal ionized outflows associated with super-Eddington accretion. Our analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the TDE AT2021ehb, around 300 days post-disruption, reveals a soft spectrum and can be fit with a combination of multi-color disk blackbody and power-law components. Using two independent disk models with properties suited to TDEs, we estimate a black hole mass at $M \simeq 10^{5.5}~M_{\odot}$, indicating AT2021ehb may expose the elusive low-mass end of the nuclear black hole population. These models offer simple yet robust characterization; more complicated models are not required, but provide important context and caveats in the limit of moderately sensitive data. If disk reflection is included, the disk flux is lower and inferred black hole masses are $\sim$ 0.35 dex higher. Simple wind formulations imply an extremely fast $v_{\mathrm{out}} = -0.2~c$ outflow and obviate a disk continuum component. Assuming a unity filling factor, such a wind implies an instantaneous mass outflow rate of $\dot{M} \simeq 5~M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Such a high rate suggests that the filling factor for the Ultra Fast Outflow (UFO) must be extremely low, and/or the UFO phase is ephemeral. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our analysis and avenues for future observations of TDEs.</description>

      <title>Supernova Shocks Cannot Explain the Inflated State of Hypervelocity Runaways from White Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have found a growing number of hypervelocity stars with speeds of $\approx 1500-2500\,$km\,s$^{-1}$ which could have only been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Most of the observed hypervelocity runaways in this class display a surprising inflated structure: their current radii are roughly an order of magnitude greater than they would have been as white dwarfs filling their Roche lobe. While many simulations exist studying the dynamical phase leading to supernova detonation in these systems, no detailed calculations of the long-term structure of the runaways have yet been performed. We use an existing \textsc{Arepo} hydrodynamical simulation of a supernova in a white dwarf binary as a starting point for the evolution of these stars with the 1 dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We show that the supernova shock is not enough to inflate the white dwarf over timescales longer than a few thousand years, significantly shorter than the $10^{5-6}$ year lifetimes inferred for observed hypervelocity runaways. Despite experiencing a shock from a supernova less than $\approx 0.02\,R_\odot$ away, our models do not experience significant interior heating, and all contract back to radii around $0.01\,R_\odot$ within about $10^4$\,years. Explaining the observed inflated states requires either an additional source of significant heating or some other physics that is not yet accounted for in the subsequent evolution.</description>

Abstract: High-energy collisions at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will generate a substantial flux of particles along the beam collision axis that current LHC experiments cannot access. Multi-particle production in the far-forward region is particularly relevant to astroparticle physics. High-energy cosmic rays initiate extensive air showers (EASs) in the atmosphere, driven by hadron-ion collisions at low momentum transfer in the non-perturbative regime of QCD. Therefore, understanding high-energy hadronic interactions in the forward region is essential for interpreting EAS data and estimating backgrounds for astrophysical neutrino searches, among other applications. The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposal to construct a new underground cavern at the HL-LHC dedicated to hosting a range of experiments aimed at detecting particles beyond the current capabilities of LHC experiments. This article will provide an update on the current planning status of the FPF and emphasize its synergies with astroparticle physics.</description>

      <title>Moment of inertia and compactness of quark stars within the context of $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the metric formalism of $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity theories, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium structure of compact stars taking into account both isotropic and anisotropic pressure. For this purpose, we focus on the $f(R,T,L_m)= R+ \alpha TL_m$ model, where $\alpha$ is a free parameter. We derive the modified TOV equations and the relativistic moment of inertia in the slowly rotating approximation. Using an equation of state (EoS) for color-superconducting quark stars, we examine the effects of the $\alpha TL_m$ term on the different macroscopic properties of these stars. Our results reveal that the decrease of the parameter $\alpha$ leads to a noticeable increase in the maximum-mass values. For negative $\alpha$ with sufficiently small $\vert\alpha\vert$, we obtain a qualitative behavior similar to the general relativistic (GR) context, namely, it is possible to obtain a critical stellar configuration such that the mass reaches its maximum. However, for sufficiently large values of $\vert\alpha\vert$ keeping negative $\alpha$, the critical point cannot be found on the mass-radius diagram. We also find that the inclusion of anisotropic pressure can provide masses and radii quite consistent with the current observational measurements, which opens an outstanding window onto the physics of anisotropic quark stars. By comparing the $I-C$ relations of isotropic quark stars in modified gravity, we show that such a correlation remains almost unchanged as the parameter $\alpha$ varies from GR counterpart. On the other hand, given a fixed $\alpha$, the $I-C$ relation is insensitive to variations of the anisotropy parameter $\beta$ to $\mathcal{O}(4\%)$.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden Inside of Gaia Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered binaries containing single BHs and visible stars without mass transfer, so-called Gaia BHs. One important question is if Gaia BHs have binary BHs (BBHs), hereafter Gaia BBHs, instead of single BHs. We have investigated how efficiently Gaia BBHs are formed in open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of Gaia BHs, by means of gravitational $N$-body simulations. Limiting Gaia BHs' periods to $10^2$-$10^4$ days, we have found that there are no Gaia BBHs in the solar-metallicity environments, while the formation efficiency of Gaia BBHs is not small ($\sim 10^{-6} M_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ % of Gaia BHs) in subsolar-metallicity environments. However, the probability of Gaia BBHs hidden in Gaia BHs is only $\sim 1$ %. This is because most of the BBHs merge within $1$ Gyr through gravitational wave radiation. Note that the ages of discovered Gaia BHs are more than $1$ Gyr. If we extend Gaia BHs' periods to $10^4$-$10^5$ days, the probability becomes higher to $\sim 10$ %. In this case, a large fraction of BBHs can have enough wide orbits not to merge within the Hubble time. The probability would not be high for Gaia BHs already discovered and to be discovered in the near future. Nevertheless, we have shown the BH/BBH mass, visible star mass, and eccentricity distributions of Gaia BHs and Gaia BBHs, which will be helpful for follow-up observations to discover Gaia BBHs. A Gaia BH would be more likely to be a Gaia BBH if it has younger age, longer period, lower-mass companion, more circular orbit, lower metallicity, and more massive BH. Our results have implied that Gaia BH3 is unlikely to be a Gaia BBH.</description>

      <title>Stability of a realistic astrophysical pulsar and its mass-radius relation in higher-order curvature gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this research is to explore compact celestial objects while considering the framework of an extended gravitational theory known as $\mathcal{R}+f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. The notations $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ denote the Ricci scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, respectively. Radio pulsars, which are neutron stars with masses greater than 1.8 times that of the Sun ($M_\odot$), provide exceptional opportunities for delving into fundamental physics in extraordinary environments unparalleled in the observable universe and surpassing the capabilities of experiments conducted on Earth. Through the utilization of both the linear and quadratic expressions of the function { $f(\mathcal{G}) = \alpha_1 \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\alpha_1$ (with dimensional units of [${\textit length}^6$]) are incorporated}, we have achieved an accurate analytical solution for anisotropic perfect-fluid spheres in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. By integrating the dimensional parameters $\alpha_1$ and the compactness factor, defined as ${\mathcal C=\frac{2GM}{Rc^2}}$, we showcase our capacity to encompass and depict all physical characteristics within the stellar structure. We illustrate that the model is capable of producing a stable arrangement encompassing its physical and geometric properties. We illustrate that by utilizing the quadratic form of $\mathcal{G}$ in the $\mathcal{R}+f(\mathcal{G})$ framework, the ansatz of Krori-Barua establishes connection between pressure in the radial direction ($p_r$) using semi-analytical methods, pressure in the tangential direction ($p_t$), and density ($\rho$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter in the Universe is still an open question in astrophysics and cosmology. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) offer a compelling solution, and traditionally ground-based experiments have eagerly, but to date unsuccessfully, searched for these hypothetical low-mass particles that are expected to be produced in large quantities in the strong electromagnetic fields in the interior of stars. This work offers a fresh look at axions and ALPs by leveraging their conversion into X-rays in the magnetic field of the Sun's atmosphere rather than a laboratory magnetic field. Unique data acquired with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) during the solar minimum in 2020 allows us to set stringent limits on the coupling of axions to photons using state-of-the-art magnetic field models of the solar atmosphere. We report pioneering limits on the axion-photon coupling strength of $6.9\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence level for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 2\times 10^{-7}$ eV, surpassing current ground-based searches and further probing unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to axion masses of $m_a \lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$ eV.</description>

Abstract: We extend the recently presented, fully exclusive, next-to-leading-order accurate event generator for the simulation of massless neutral- and charged-current deep inelastic scattering (DIS) to the case of incoming neutrinos. The generator can be used to study neutrino-nucleon interactions at (ultra) high energies, and is relevant for a range of fixed-target collider experiments and large-volume neutrino detectors, investigating atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. The matching with multi-purpose event generators such as PYTHIA 8 is performed with the POWHEG method, and accounts for parton showering and non-perturbative effects such as hadronization. This makes it possible to investigate higher-order perturbative corrections to realistic observables, such as the distribution of charged particles. To illustrate the capabilities of the code we provide predictions for several differential distributions in fixed-target collisions for neutrino energies up to 1 PeV.</description>

      <title>SDSSJ0018-0939: A Clear Signature of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type 1a Supernova</title>

Abstract: Very metal-poor (VMP) stars (${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$) that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for $\alpha$ elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as $\alpha$-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernovae (SN 1a) in contrast to most VMP stars which are $\alpha$-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN 1a. Although the abundance patterns in some $\alpha$-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN 1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN 1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the $\alpha$-poor VMP star SDSSJ0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides almost a smoking-gun signature of a sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other $\alpha$-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN 1a, SDSSJ0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN 1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN 1a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a account for $\sim 50\hbox{--}75\,\%$ of all SN 1a are and possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength properties of three new radio-powerful $z\sim5.6$ QSOs discovered from RACS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study on three new $z\sim5.6$ quasi stellar objects (QSOs) selected based on their radio and optical/near-infrared properties in publicly available surveys and then identified with dedicated spectroscopic observations. These are among the radio-brightest QSOs currently known at $z&gt;5.5$, having $\rm R=S_{\rm 5GHz}/S_{\rm 4400A}&gt;100$. In this work we present their identification and we also discuss their multi-wavelength properties (from the radio to the X-ray band) based on the detection in public surveys as well as dedicated radio and X-ray observations. The three sources present a wide range of properties, in terms of relative intensity and spectral shape, highlighting the importance of multi-wavelength observations in order to accurately characterise these high-$z$ objects. In particular, from our analysis we found one source, at $z=5.61$, that presents clear blazars properties (strong and flat radio and X-ray emission), making it one of the most distant currently known in this class. Moreover, from the fit of the optical/near-infrared photometric measurements with an accretion disc model, as well as the analysis of the CIV broad emission line in one case, we were able to estimate the mass and the accretion rate of the central black holes in these systems, finding $\rm M_{\rm BH}\sim1-10\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ accreting at a rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1-0.2$. With this work we increase the number of very-high redshift radio-powerful QSOs characterised with multi-wavelength observations, essential in order to understand the evolution and the properties of this still poorly constrained class of sources.</description>

      <title>Observational prospects of self-interacting scalar superradiance with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current- and next-generation gravitational-wave observatories may reveal new, ultralight bosons. Through the superradiance process, these theoretical particle candidates can form clouds around astrophysical black holes and result in detectable gravitational-wave radiation. In the absence of detections, constraints$-$contingent on astrophysical assumptions$-$have been derived using LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data on boson masses. However, the searches for ultralight scalars to date have not adequately considered self-interactions between particles. Self-interactions that significantly alter superradiance dynamics are generically present for many scalar models, including axion-like dark matter candidates and string axions. We implement the most complete treatment of particle self-interactions available to determine the gravitational-wave signatures expected from superradiant scalar clouds and revisit the constraints obtained in a past gravitational-wave search targeting the black hole in Cygnus X-1. We also project the reach of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to scalar particle parameter space in the mass-coupling plane. We find that while proposed observatories have insufficient reach to self-interactions that can halt black hole spin-down, next-generation observatories are essential for expanding the search beyond gravitational parameter space and can reach a mass and interaction scale of $\sim 10^{-13}-10^{-12}$ eV/c$^2$ and $\gtrsim 10^{17}$ GeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Constraining the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy with direct Urca processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density dependence of the symmetry energy in relativistic mean-field models with density dependent couplings is discussed in terms of the possible opening of nucleonic direct Urca processes inside neutron stars, which induce a very rapid cooling of the star. The modification of the parametrization of the isospin channel of two models, DD2 and DDMEX, keeping the same isoscalar properties is considered and the implications are discussed. Within the models discussed it is not possible the onset of nucleonic direct Urca processes in stars with a mass below $\sim1.6-1.8\, M_\odot$. The lowest masses that allow direct Urca processes are associated to a slope of the symmetry energy $\sim60$ MeV and a symmetry energy incompressibility close to zero. It is shown that the parametrization of the isospin channel proposed destroys the correlation between symmetry energy slope and incompressibility previously identified in several works.</description>

      <title>On the overlap reduction function of pulsar timing array searches for gravitational waves in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for gravitational waves (GWs) aim to detect a characteristic correlation pattern in the timing residuals of galactic millisecond pulsars. This pattern is described by the PTA overlap reduction function (ORF) \Gamma_ab(\xi_ab), which is known as the Hellings--Downs (HD) curve in general relativity (GR). In theories of modified gravity, the HD curve often receives corrections. Assuming, e.g., a subluminal GW phase velocity, one finds a drastically enhanced ORF in the limit of small angular separations between pulsar a and pulsar b in the sky, \xi_ab --&gt; 0. In particular, working in harmonic space and performing an approximate resummation of all multipole contributions, the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa seems to diverge. In this paper, we confirm that this divergence is unphysical and provide an exact and analytical expression for \Gamma_aa in dependence of the pulsar distance L_a and the GW phase velocity v_ph. In the GR limit and assuming a large pulsar distance, our expression reduces to \Gamma_aa = 1. In the case of subluminal phase velocity, we show that the regularization of the naive divergent result is a finite-distance effect, meaning that \Gamma_aa scales linearly with fL_a, where f is the GW frequency. For superluminal phase velocity (subluminal group velocity), which is relevant in the case of massive gravity, we correct an earlier analytical result for \Gamma_ab. Our results pave the way for fitting modified-gravity theories with nonstandard phase velocity to PTA data, which requires a proper understanding of the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa.</description>

      <title>LeHaMoC: a versatile time-dependent lepto-hadronic modeling code for high-energy astrophysical sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent associations of high-energy neutrinos with active galactic nuclei (AGN) have revived the interest in leptohadronic models of radiation from astrophysical sources. The rapid increase in the amount of acquired multi-messenger data will require soon fast numerical models that may be applied to large source samples. We develop a time-dependent leptohadronic code, LeHaMoC, that offers several notable benefits compared to other existing codes, such as versatility and speed. LeHaMoC solves the Fokker-Planck equations of photons and relativistic particles (i.e. electrons, positrons, protons, and neutrinos) produced in a homogeneous magnetized source that may also be expanding. The code utilizes a fully implicit difference scheme that allows fast computation of steady-state and dynamically evolving physical problems. We first present test cases where we compare the numerical results obtained with LeHaMoC against exact analytical solutions and numerical results computed with ATHE$\nu$A, a well-tested code of similar philosophy but different numerical implementation. We find a good agreement (within 10-30%) with the numerical results obtained with ATHE$\nu$A without evidence of systematic differences. We then demonstrate the capabilities of the code through illustrative examples. First, we fit the spectral energy distribution from a jetted AGN in the context of a synchrotron-self Compton model and a proton-synchrotron model using Bayesian inference. Second, we compute the high-energy neutrino signal and the electromagnetic cascade induced by hadronic interactions in the corona of NGC 1068. LeHaMoC is easily customized to model a variety of high-energy astrophysical sources and has the potential to become a widely utilized tool in multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Roche problem for stars in precessing orbits around a spinning black hole</title>

Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars on the equatorial plane orbiting Kerr black holes have been widely studied. However thus far, there have been fewer studies of stars in inclined precessing orbits around a Kerr black hole. In this paper, we use the tensor virial equations to show the presence of possible resonances in these systems for typical physical parameters of black hole-neutron star binaries in close orbits or of a white dwarf/an ordinary star orbiting a supermassive black hole. This suggests the presence of a new instability before the tidal disruption limit is encountered in such systems.</description>

      <title>Background information: a study on the sensitivity of astrophysical gravitational-wave background searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast majority of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass compact binary mergers are too weak to be individually detected with present-day instruments and instead contribute to a faint, persistent background. This astrophysical background is targeted by searches that model the gravitational-wave ensemble collectively with a small set of parameters. The traditional search models the background as a stochastic field and estimates its amplitude by cross-correlating data from multiple interferometers. A different search uses gravitational-wave templates to marginalize over all individual event parameters and measure the duty cycle and population properties of binary mergers. Both searches ultimately estimate the total merger rate of compact binaries and are expected to yield a detection in the coming years. Given the conceptual and methodological differences between them, though, it is not well understood how their results should be mutually interpreted. In this paper, we use the Fisher information to study the implications of a background detection in terms of which region of the Universe each approach probes. Specifically, we quantify how information about the compact binary merger rate is accumulated by each search as a function of the event redshift. For the LIGO Design sensitivity and a uniform-in-comoving-volume distribution of equal-mass 30M_sol binaries, the traditional cross-correlation search obtains 99% of its information from binaries up to redshift 2.5 (average signal-to-noise-ratio &lt;8), and the template-based search from binaries up to redshift 1.0 (average signal-to-noise-ratio ~8). While we do not calculate the total information accumulated by each search, our analysis emphasizes the need to pair any claimed detection of the stochastic background with an assessment of which binaries contribute to said detection.</description>

Abstract: The supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443 is one of the best-studied Galactic SNRs at many wavelengths. It is interacting with a very complex environment, including the SNR G189.6+3.3 and HII regions. In this paper, we observed IC 443 and G189.6+3.3 using 1.5- and 1-m telescopes to better understand the nature of these SNRs in the optical band. We perform H_alpha images showing both filamentary and diffuse structures, and long-slit spectra from many locations with Balmer and forbidden lines detected for IC 443 and G189.6+3.3. The [SII]/ H_alpha ratios confirm the SNR nature of G189.6+3.3. The ranges of our estimated electron density and pre-shock cloud density clearly indicate the complex structure surrounding IC 443 and G189.6+3.3. We also investigated the archival HI data and newly found some shell-like distributions of HI that are possibly associated with G189.6+3.3.</description>

      <title>Formation of millisecond pulsars with wide orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are a kind of radio pulsars with short spin periods, playing a key role in many aspects of stellar astrophysics. In recent years, some more MSPs with wide orbits ($&gt;30\,\rm d$) have been discovered, but their origin is still highly unclear. In the present work, according to an adiabatic power-law assumption for the mass-transfer process, we carried out a large number of complete binary evolution computations for the formation of MSPs with wide orbits through the iron core-collapse supernova (CCSN) channel, in which a neutron star (NS) originating from a CCSN accretes matter from a red-giant (RG) star and spun up to millisecond periods. We found that this channel can form the observed MSPs with wide orbits in the range of $30-1200\,{\rm d}$, in which the WD companions have masses in the range of $0.28-0.55\,\rm M_{\odot}$. We also found that almost all the observed MSPs can be reproduced by this channel in the WD companion mass versus orbital period diagram. We estimate that the Galactic numbers of the resulting MSPs from the CCSN channel are in the range of $\sim 4.8-8.5\times10^{5}$. Compared with the accretion-induced collapse channel, the CCSN channel provides a main way to produce MSPs with wide orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of high-momentum correlated neutron-proton pairs at JLab suggest that the dense nucleonic component of the compact stars contain a fraction of high-momentum neutron-proton pairs that is not accounted in the familiar Fermi-liquid theory of the neutron-proton fluid mixture. We compute the rate of the Urca process in compact stars taking into the non-Fermi liquid contributions to the proton's spectral widths induced by short-range correlations. The Urca rate differs strongly from the Fermi-liquid prediction at low temperatures, in particular, the high threshold on the proton fraction precluding the Urca process in neutron stars is lifted. This observation may have a profound impact on the theories of cooling of compact stars.</description>
