      <title>How Surface Make-Up and Receding Electrokinetics Determine the Sign and Magnitude of Electrification at Water-Hydrophobe Interfaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been widely reported that as water contacts hydrophobic materials such as air or hydrocarbons (liquid or solid), the interfaces acquire a negative charge. It is not entirely clear whether this occurs due to the nature of water, or the hydrophobe, or purely the interface. Here, we probe the effects of surface chemistry and the speed of liquid-solid contact formation and separation on electrification. Glass capillaries grafted with mixed self-assembled monolayers of octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) and (3-aminopropy)triethoxysilane (APTES) were exploited. Water was drawn inside these capillaries from an electroneutral reservoir, and the excess charge carried by the pendant droplets, if any, was quantified using an electrometer with a 100 fC resolution. Depending on the APTES content, the surface charge density at the water-hydrophobe interface ranged from negative (for ODTS) to near-neutral (for APTES 2-sec-exposure followed by ODTS) to positive APTES(5s)-ODTS. Next, we probed the charge (Q) contributions of the following steps on the electrification: (i) Contact (Q_1^n): as a dry capillary enters the water reservoir; (ii) Liquid uptake (Q_2^n): as water is uptaken; (iii) Capillary lift (Q_3^n): the filled capillary is removed from the reservoir; and (iv) Liquid release (Q_4^n): releasing the liquid back into the reservoir. This revealed that the electrification during water uptake (Q_2^n) varied with the rate of release during the previous cycle (Q_4^(n-1)), and it did not depend on the uptake rate. We explain these findings based on the electrical double layer theory, electrokinetics, and charge conservation, advancing the current understanding of electrification.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality between cellulose nanocrystals and a low-molecular weight gelator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of multicomponent hydrogels has gained a lot of attention in the field of soft matter, as precise tuning of the chemical nature and colloidal properties of each component brings mechanical and functional benefits compared to one-component gels. Within the field, orthogonality between a self-assembled low-molecular weight gelator (LMWG) and a colloid is a domain that has received little attention. In this study, orthogonal LMWG-colloid hydrogels were developed with the additional constraint of sustainability: a bolaamphiphile glycolipid (G-C18:1) is selected as LMWG while cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as colloid. These compounds are chosen for their dual role. G-C18:1 is a LMWG but it can also be used, at lower concentrations, as surface stabilizer for CNCs and tune its aggregative properties. On the other hand, tuning surface properties of CNCs drives its bulk behavior: uncharged CNCs locally aggregate and act as reinforcing agent for the LMWG gel, while negatively-charged CNCs, cross-linked with Ca 2+ , naturally form a hydrogel, which can interpenetrate with the LMWG network. By means of rheometry, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and rheo-SAXS, it is shown here how the aggregative behavior of CNCs enhances the mechanical properties of G-C18:1 hydrogels, while G-C18:1 imparts pH and temperature responsiveness to CNC hydrogels.  An interesting field of research in soft matter science is the development of orthogonal hydrogels containing cellulose and LMWGs, although, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing reports. Since cellulose is among the most extensively studied macromolecules in the field of soft matter, particularly for biomedical applications, 22,23 developing and studying the properties of orthogonal hydrogels containing CNCs and a LMWG represents an intriguing avenue for research, and this for two reasons. First of all, CNCs are bio-based nanoparticles, relevant for the development of sustainable nanoscale science and engineering. Secondly, the surface chemistry of CNCs can be controlled in such a way to tune their aggregation and dispersion properties, making them interesting either as reinforcements in hydrogels, 24,25 or as hydrogel scaffold themselves. 26,27 These aspects were never explored in the context of orthogonal hydrogels.  In this work, we then study orthogonality in fully bio-based hydrogels composed of a single glucose lipid LMWG (G-C18:1) and CNCs. G-C18:1 is selected for its multiphasic behavior in water at room temperature 28 and linked to its unique surfactant-lipid-gelator nature, 28,29 tuned by pH and/or type of ion. Below neutral pH and at concentrations under 5 wt%, G-C18:1 forms vesicles, displaying a lipid-like behavior. At pH above neutrality, it assembles into micelles, thus exhibiting a surfactant behavior. 30,31 When Ca 2+ is added to its micellar phase, 32,33 G-C18:1 forms fiber gels 30 (Figure 1). In particular, we focused on orthogonal G-C18:1/CNC hydrogels, in which CNCs either assembled into hydrogels (negatively-charged and cross-linked by calcium ions, referred to as SCNCs, Figure 1) or behaved as reinforcing agents (uncharged CNCs prepared via HCl hydrolysis, referred to as CNC$\alpha$, and neutral surface stabilized by G-C18:1, 34 Figure 1). These two types of CNCs exhibit distinct roles in the hydrogel system: SCNCs actively participate in the formation of a percolated network, while CNC$\alpha$ are used to reinforce the hydrogel matrix physically. Specific attention is paid to the impact of the assembled form of CNCs to the elastic properties of the LMWG hydrogel as well as how the responsivity to pH and temperature of the LMWG affect the elastic properties of CNC hydrogels. 33 </description>

      <title>Instability and self-propulsion of flexible autophoretic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, autophoretic colloids have emerged as a prototypical system for studying self-propelled motion at microscopic scales, with promising applications in microfluidics, micro-machinery, and therapeutics. Their motion in a viscous fluid hinges on their ability to induce surface slip flows that are spatially asymmetric, from self-generated solute gradients. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that a straight elastic filament with homogeneous surface chemical properties -- which is otherwise immotile -- can spontaneously achieve self-propulsion by experiencing a buckling instability that serves as the symmetry-breaking mechanism. Using efficient numerical simulations, we characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the elastic filament and show that, over time, it attains distinct swimming modes such as a steadily translating "U" shape and a metastable rotating "S" shape when semi-flexible, and an oscillatory state when highly flexible. Our findings provide physical insight into future experiments and the design of reconfigurable synthetic active colloids.</description>

      <title>Self-locking and Stability of the Bowline Knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the self-locking of the bowline knot through numerical simulations, experiments, and theoretical analysis. Specifically, we perform two complementary types of simulations using the 3D finite-element method (FEM) and a reduced-order model based on the discrete-element method (DEM). For the FEM simulations, we develop a novel mapping technique that automatically transforms the centerline of the rod into the required knot topology prior to loading. In parallel, we conduct experiments using a nearly inextensible elastic rod tied into a bowline around a rigid cylinder. One end of the rod is pulled to load the knot while the other is left free. The measured force-displacement response serves to validate both the FEM and DEM simulations. Leveraging these validated computational frameworks, we analyze the internal tension profile along the rod's centerline, revealing that a sharp drop in tension concentrates around a strategic locking region, whose geometry resembles that observed in other knot types. By considering the coupling of tension, bending, and friction, we formulate a theoretical model inspired by the classic capstan problem to predict the stability conditions of the bowline, finding excellent agreement with our FEM and DEM simulations. Our methodology and findings offer new tools and insights for future studies on the performance and reliability of other complex knots.</description>

      <title>Knotted DNA Configurations in Bacteriophage Capsids: A Liquid Crystal Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, store their micron long DNA inside an icosahedral capsid with a typical diameter of 40 nm to 100 nm. Consistent with experimental observations, such confinement conditions induce an arrangement of DNA that corresponds to a hexagonal chromonic liquid-crystalline phase, and increase the topological complexity of the genome in the form of knots. A mathematical model that implements a chromonic liquid-crystalline phase and that captures the changes in topology has been lacking. We adopt a mathematical model that represents the viral DNA as a pair of a vector field and a line. The vector field is a minimizer of the total Oseen-Frank energy for nematic liquid crystals under chromonic constraints, while the line is identified with the tangent to the field at selected locations, representing the central axis of the DNA molecule. The fact that the Oseen-Frank functional assigns infinite energy to topological defects (point defects in two dimensions and line defects in three dimensions) precludes the presence of singularities and, in particular, of knot structures. To address this issue, we begin with the optimal vector field and helical line, and propose a new algorithm to introduce knots through stochastic perturbations associated with splay and twist deformations, modeled by means of a Langevin system. We conclude by comparing knot distributions generated by the model and by interpreting them in the context of previously published experimental results. Altogether, this work relies on the synergy of modeling, analysis and computation in the study of viral DNA organization in capsids.</description>

      <title>Image detection-based high-throughput sorting of particles using traveling surface acoustic waves in microscale flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large particle sorters have potential applications in sorting microplastics and large biomaterials (&gt;50 micrometer), such as tissues, spheroids, organoids, and embryos. Though great advancements have been made in image-based sorting of cells and particles (&lt;50 micrometer), their translation for high-throughput sorting of larger biomaterials and particles (&gt;50 micrometer) has been more limited. An image-based detection technique is highly desirable due to richness of the data (including size, shape, color, morphology, and optical density) that can be extracted from live images of individualized biomaterials or particles. Such a detection technique is label-free and can be integrated with a contact-free actuation mechanism such as one based on traveling surface acoustic waves (TSAWs). Recent advances in using TSAWs for sorting cells and particles (&lt;50 micrometer) have demonstrated short response times (&lt;1 ms), high biocompatibility, and reduced energy requirements to actuate. Additionally, TSAW-based devices are miniaturized and easier to integrate with an image-based detection technique. In this work, a high-throughput image-detection based large particle microfluidic sorting technique is implemented. The technique is used to separate binary mixtures of small and large polyethylene particles (ranging between ~45-180 micrometer in size). All particles in flow were first optically interrogated for size, followed by actuations using momentum transfer from TSAW pulses, if they satisfied the size cutoff criterion. The effect of control parameters such as duration and power of TSAW actuation pulse, inlet flow rates, and sample dilution on sorting efficiency and throughput was observed. At the chosen conditions, this sorting technique can sort on average ~4.9-34.3 particles/s (perform ~2-3 actuations/s), depending on the initial sample composition and concentration.</description>

      <title>Optical tweezers assisted coupling of nematic droplets to gold nanoparticle cluster: Effect on whispering gallery modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dye doped liquid crystal (LC) microdroplets exhibit tunable optical resonances modulated by size, shape, temperature, and external perturbations. When a dye-doped nematic microdroplet is coupled to a gold nanoparticle cluster, near-field interactions enhance local electric fields, boosting fluorescence emission. Optical tweezers serve as a tool for the parking of dye doped nematic microdroplets on gold nanoparticle clusters, enabling the dynamic coupling and excitation of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). This configuration resulted in amplified WGMs, with a clearly detectable shift in the spectral position. Resonance mode red shifts confirmed efficient photonic plasmonic coupling, with up to seven nm tunability achieved without significant degradation of the Q-factor. The magnitude of tunability depends on the size of the gold nanoparticle cluster. Also, the WGM emission spectrum of the nematic microdroplet can be reversibly tuned by decoupling from the gold nanoparticle cluster.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the multiscale surface mechanics of soft solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The softer a material is, the more its mechanics are sensitive to interfaces. In soft gels, an elastic polymeric network is filled with free-flowing molecules. In theory, either of these components could dominate the material interfacial properties. In practice, current measurements cannot distinguish between the two, nor can they rule out material inhomogeneities, which could modulate the apparent properties of the interfaces. Here, we introduce an experimental approach that elucidates the interfacial mechanics of soft solids. Coupling quantum dots, controlled deformations, and precise confocal measurements, we fully separate the material inhomogeneities of a silicone gel from its true interfacial properties. We quantify a gradient in bulk elastic properties near the surface, with a characteristic length scale of about 20 {\mu}m. In addition, we observe a surface excess elasticity, whose associated gradient is unresolvable with light microscopy. The composition of the external medium has a strong affect on the observed value of the surface elasticity. Thus, we conclude that the surface elasticity of this silicone network is an interfacial property.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical self-assembly for high-yield addressable complexity at fixed conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is evidence that the self-assembly of complex molecular systems often proceeds hierarchically, by first building subunits that later assemble in larger entities, in a process that can repeat multiple times. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon and its performance is limited. Here we introduce a simple model for hierarchical addressable self-assembly, where interactions between particles can be optimised to maximise the fraction of a well-formed target structure, or yield. We find that a hierarchical strategy leads to an impressive yield up to at least five generations of the hierarchy, and does not require a cycle of temperatures as used in previous methods. High yield is obtained when the microscopic interaction decreases with the scale of units considered, such that the total interaction between intermediate structures remains identical at all scales. We provide thermodynamic and dynamical arguments constraining the interaction strengths where this strategy is effective. Overall, our work characterizes an alternative strategy for addressable self-assembly at a fixed temperature, and provides insight into the mechanisms sustaining hierarchical assembly in biology.</description>

      <title>Adhesion differentials control the rheology of biomimetic emulsions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animal morphogenesis involves complex tissue deformation processes, which require tight control over tissue rheology. Yet, it remains insufficiently understood how tissue rheology results from the interplay between cellular packing and cellular forces, such as cortical tension, cell pressure, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we follow a biomimetic approach to study this interplay. We mimic adhesive cells with oil droplets whose adhesion strength and specificity can be flexibly tuned. Using microfluidics, we expose 2D emulsions to an oscillatory geometry imposing cyclic pure shear, and we develop a geometric method to quantify their rheology using only imaging data. We find that some of the emulsions made of two droplet types progressively change their yielding behavior across subsequent shear cycles. Combining this with vertex model simulations, we show that the observed shift in yielding behavior is due to a progressive compaction, which only occurs in emulsions with a high adhesion differential and only when exposed to oscillatory shear. Gradients of cell compaction have been observed during animal development. Our work demonstrates how such gradients can be used to control gradients of tissue rheological properties. Moreover, the progressive compaction suggests the emergence of a pumping mechanism, which potentially acts in many cellular materials, from foams to tissues.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21593v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity upon dehydration, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics. Finally, the increase of the area per lipid in our tension-free simulations of the fluid membranes hints that the permittivity decrease upon dehydration is concomitant with an intermembrane attraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the machine learning of density functionals allows one to determine simultaneously the equilibrium chemical potential across simulation datasets of inhomogeneous classical fluids. Minimization of a loss function based on an Euler-Lagrange equation yields both the universal one-body direct correlation functional, which is represented locally by a neural network, as well as the system-specific unknown chemical potential values. The method can serve as an efficient alternative to conventional computational techniques of measuring the chemical potential. It also facilitates using canonical data from Brownian dynamics, molecular dynamics, or Monte Carlo simulations as a basis for constructing neural density functionals, which are fit for accurate multiscale prediction of soft matter systems in equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are extensively employed for processing sequential data such as time series. Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive platform for hardware based machine learning. We establish an explicit correspondence between the well-established mathematical RC implementations of Echo State Networks and Band-pass Networks with Leaky Integrator nodes on the one hand and a physical circuit containing iontronic simple volatile memristors on the other. These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures. We accomplish this by employing established physical equations of motion of iontronic memristors for the internal dynamics of the circuit.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>

Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Active viscoelastic condensates provide controllable mechanical anchor points</title>

Abstract: Many biological materials must couple mechanical strength with the ability to rapidly self-assemble at a specific location. In particular, biomolecular condensates readily self-assemble via phase separation, but may also need to resist external forces to fulfil their function. Spatial localisation of condensate formation can be controlled by active cores that preferentially drive the production of condensate material at a particular point, while resistance to external forces can be facilitated by viscoelastic material properties. To investigate the interplay of these two processes, we develop a continuum model of viscoelastic growth around an active core. We find that viscoelastic stresses restrict condensate growth, but also impart resistance to deformation. We investigate the effect of different incorporation schemes on growth dynamics, and test the influence of mechanical properties on condensate strength. Finally, we compare the predictions of our model to experimental data from centrosomes in C. elegans embryos, identifying a parameter regime in which rapid growth can be combined with appropriate mechanical strength, and studying how strain-dependent material incorporation may lead to isotropic growth of scaffold material. Our results provide general design principles for other materials that must reconcile rapid, localised self-assembly with mechanical strength, such as focal adhesions.</description>
