      <title>Challenges and Opportunities Associated with Technology Driven Biomechanical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the principal challenges and opportunities associated with computational biomechanics research. The underlying cognitive control involved in the process of human motion is inherently complex, dynamic, multidimensional, and highly non-linear. The dynamics produced by the internal and external forces and the body's ability to react to them is biomechanics. Complex and non-rigid bodies, needs a lot of computing power and systems to execute however, in the absence of adequate resources, one may rely on new technology, machine learning tools and model order reduction approaches. It is also believed that machine learning approaches can enable us to embrace this complexity, if we could use three arms of ML i.e. predictive modeling, classification, and dimensionality reduction. Biomechanics, since it deals with motion and mobility come with a huge set of data over time. Using computational (Computer Solvers), Numerical approaches (MOR) and technological advances (Wearable sensors), can let us develop computationally inexpensive frameworks for biomechanics focused studies dealing with a huge amount of data. A lot of misunderstanding arises because of extensive data, standardization of the tools to process this, database for the material property definitions, validation and verification of biomechanical models and analytical tools to model various phenomena using computational and modelling techniques. Study of biomechanics through computational simulations can improve the prevention and treatment of diseases, predict the injury to reduce the risk and hence can strengthen pivotal sectors like sports and lifestyle. This is why we choose to present all those challenges and problems associated with biomechanical simulation with complex geometries fail so as to help improve, analysis, performance and design for better lifestyle.</description>

      <title>Scatter correction for photon-counting detector based CBCT imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study is to validate the effectiveness of an energy-modulated scatter correction method in suppressing scatter in photon-counting detector (PCD)-based cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging. Approach: The scatter correction method, named e-Grid, which was initially applied to dual-layer flat-panel detector (DLFPD)-based CBCT imaging, was tested for its performance in PCD-CBCT imaging. Benchtop PCD-CBCT imaging experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the e-Grid method. Additionally, quantitative metrics were measured from these experimental results. Main results: It was found that the use of the e-Grid method could significantly eliminate cupping artifacts caused by Compton scatter in PCD-CBCT imaging. Meanwhile, its effectiveness was observed in both low- and high-energy images, as well as for objects of varying sizes. Quantitative results showed that the e-Grid method could reduce scatter artifacts by at least 71% in low-energy images and 75% in high-energy images. Significance: It was demonstrated that the scatter correction method originally applied to DLFPD-based CBCT could also perform well in PCD-CBCT, showing that the e-Grid method has great potential for application in other spectral CBCT imaging systems.</description>
