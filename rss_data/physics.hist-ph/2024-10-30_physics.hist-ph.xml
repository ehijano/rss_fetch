      <title>Quantum Reconstructions as Stepping Stones toward Psi-Doxastic Interpretations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum foundations, there is growing interest in the program of reconstructing the quantum formalism from clear physical principles. These reconstructions are formulated in an operational framework, deriving the formalism from information-theoretic principles. It has been recognized that this project is in tension with standard Psi-ontic interpretations. This paper presupposes that the quantum reconstruction program (QRP) (i) is a worthwhile project and (ii) puts pressure on Psi-ontic interpretations. Where does this leave us? Prima facie, it seems that Psi-epistemic interpretations perfectly fit the spirit of information-based reconstructions. However, Psi-epistemic interpretations, understood as saying that the wave functions represents one's knowledge about a physical system, recently have been challenged on technical and conceptual grounds. More importantly, for some researchers working on reconstructions, the lesson of successful reconstructions is that the wave function does not represent objective facts about the world. Since knowledge is a factive concept, this speaks against epistemic interpretations. In this paper, I discuss whether Psi-doxastic interpretations constitute a reasonable alternative. My thesis is that if we want to engage QRP with Psi-doxastic interpretations, then we should aim at a reconstruction that is spelled out in non-factive experiential terms.</description>
