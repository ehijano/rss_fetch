      <title>Distribution of roots of Eulerian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the empirical measures of roots of Eulerian polynomials converge to a certain log-Cauchy distribution. To do so, we show that the moments of the roots of a related family of polynomials not only converge, but are in fact ultimately constant. These asymptotic moments are expressed in terms of N\"orlund's numbers.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction of trees from their chromatic symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Stanley's chromatic symmetric function (CSF) for trees when expressed in the star basis. We use the deletion-near-contraction (DNC) algorithm to compute coefficients that occur in the CSF in the star basis. In particular, one of our main results determines the smallest partition in lexicographic order that occurs as an indexing partition in the CSF, and we also give a formula for its coefficient. In addition to describing properties of trees encoded in the coefficients of the star basis, we give an algorithm for reconstructing trees of diameter less than six.</description>

      <title>New Steiner systems $S(2,6,v)$ with block length 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper various Steiner systems $S(2,k,v)$ for $k = 6$ are collected and enumerated for specific constructions. In particular, two earlier unknown types of $1$-rotational designs are found for the groups $SL(2,5)$ and $((\mathbb Z_3 \times \mathbb Z_3) \rtimes \mathbb Z_3) \times \mathbb Z_5$. Also new Steiner systems $S(2,6,96), S(2,6,106), S(2,6,111)$ are listed.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension of a Direct Product of Three Complete Graphs: The Middle Cone Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, we determined the metric dimension for a direct product of three isomorphic complete graphs. Turning to the case where the complete graphs may have different orders, there are three families we refer to as the upper, lower, and middle cones. We determine the metric dimension and location-total-domination number for a family of direct products of three complete graphs stemming from the middle cone. We explicitly describe minimum resolving sets. To verify the sets are resolving, we define a basic landmark system and show it will be a resolving set if and only if its associated 3-edge-colored hypergraph avoids three types of forbidden subgraphs. This generalizes the technique used for three isomorphic factors.</description>

      <title>Valuated Delta Matroids and Principal Minors of Hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce valuated $\Delta$-matroids, a natural generalization of two objects of study in matroid theory: valuated matroids and $\Delta$-matroids. We show that these objects exhibit nice properties analogous to ordinary valuated matroids. We also show that these objects arise as the valuations of principal minors of a Hermitian matrix over a valued field, generalizing other forms of $\Delta$-matroid representability.</description>

      <title>On distinguishing coloring and some variants of proper coloring of graphs derived from subdivision operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a simple, finite, connected, and undirected graph, and T be a finite tree. The middle graph M(G) of G is obtained from the subdivision graph S(G) after joining pairs of subdivided vertices that lie on adjacent edges of G and the central graph C(G) of G is obtained from S(G) after joining all non-adjacent vertices of G.
  We show that if the order of G is at least 4, then Aut(G), Aut(C(G)), and Aut(M(G)) are isomorphic (as abstract groups) and apply these results to obtain new sharp upper bounds of the distinguishing number and the distinguishing index of C(G) and M(G) inspired by an algorithm due to Kalinowski, Pilsniak, and Wozniak from 2016.
  Furthermore, we study the total distinguishing chromatic number of C(G) and S(G), use Latin squares to verify the AVD-total coloring conjecture for central graphs of regular graphs and some other classes of graphs (which is a partial progress towards answering an open question of Panda, Verma, and Keerti from 2020), and obtain new bounds of the total dominator chromatic number of C(G) and C(T).</description>

      <title>$s$-Shunt Intersection Graph of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection graph of a family of sets $\{S_{1},S_{2},\ldots,S_{n}\}$ is a graph whose vertex set is $\{S_{1},S_{2},\ldots,S_{n}\}$ and two distinct vertices are adjacent if the intersection of the corresponding sets is non-empty. Different types of intersection graphs have been studied depending on the nature of sets taken as the vertex set. A study on a particular type of intersection graph called $s$-shunt intersection graph, generated from the $s$-arcs of a given graph is initiated in this paper.</description>

      <title>Planar Tur\'an number of disjoint union of $C_3$ and $C_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Tur\'an number of $H$, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free planar graph. The planar Tur\'an number of $k\geq 3$ vertex-disjoint union of cycles is the trivial value $3n-6$. Let $C_{\ell}$ denote the cycle of length $\ell$ and $C_{\ell}\cup C_t$ denote the union of disjoint cycles $C_{\ell}$ and $C_t$. The planar Tur\'an number $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$ is known if $H=C_{\ell}\cup C_k$, where $\ell,k\in \{3,4\}$. In this paper, we determine the value $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,C_3\cup C_5)=\lfloor\frac{8n-13}{3}\rfloor$ and characterize the extremal graphs when $n$ is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Laplacians and relative Homology of complex pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a discretization of the Hodge Laplacian, the combinatorial Laplacian of simplicial complexes has garnered significant attention. In this paper, we study combinatorial Laplacians for complex pairs $(X, A)$, where $A$ is a subcomplex of a simplicial complex $X$. We establish a relative version of the matrix-tree theorem for complex pairs, which generalizes both the matrix-tree theorem for simplicial complexes proved by Duval, Klivans, and Martin (2009) and the result for Dirichlet eigenvalues of graph pairs by Chung (1996). Furthermore, we derive several lower bounds for the spectral gaps of complex pairs and characterize the equality case for one sharp lower bound. As by-products, we obtain sufficient conditions for the vanishing of relative homology. Our results demonstrate that the combinatorial Laplacians for complex pairs are closely related to relative homology.</description>

      <title>$p$-th order generalized Fibonacci cubes and maximal cubes in Fibonacci $p$-cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fibonacci cube $\Gamma_n$ is the subgraph of the hypercube $Q_n$ induced by vertices with no consecutive 1s. We study a one parameter generalization, p-th order Fibonacci cubes $\Gamma^{(p)}_n$, which are subgraphs of $Q_n$ induced by strings without p consecutive 1s. We show the link between vertices of $\Gamma^{(p)}_n$ and compositions of integers with parts in $\{1, 2, \ldots , p\}$. Among other eumerative properties, we study the order, size and cube polynomial of $\Gamma^{(p)}_n$ as well as their generating functions. Many of the given expressions are similar to those for Fibonacci cubes, where the $p$-nomial coefficients play the role of binomial coefficients. We also show that maximal induced hypercubes in Fibonacci $p$-cubes $\Gamma^p_n$ , another generalization of Fibonacci cubes, are connected to vertices of $(p + 1)$-th order Fibonacci cubes. We use this link to determine the maximal cube polynomial of Fibonacci $p$-cubes.</description>

      <title>Hilbert basis in the face-centered cubic grid -- mathematical proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hilbert basis is fundamental in describing the structure of the integer points of a polyhedral cone. The face-centered cubic grid is one of the densest packing of the 3-dimensional space. The cycles of a grid satisfy the constraint set of a pointed, polyhedral cone which contains only non-negative integer vectors. The Hilbert basis of a grid gives the structure of the basic cycles in the grid. It is shown in this paper that the basic cycles of the FCC grid belong to 11 types. It is also discussed that how many elements are contained in the individual types. The proofs of the paper use geometric, combinatorial, algebraic, and operations research methods.</description>

      <title>On the representation number of grid graphs and cylindric grid graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation number of a graph is the minimum number of copies of each vertex required to represent the graph as a word, such that the letters corresponding to vertices $x$ and $y$ alternate if and only if $xy$ is an edge in the graph. It is known that path graphs, circle graphs, and ladder graphs have representation number 2, while prism graphs have representation number 3.
  In this paper, we extend these results by showing that generalizations of the aforementioned graphs -- namely, the $m \times n$ grid graphs and $m \times n$ cylindrical grid graphs -- have representation number $3$ for $m \geq 3$ and $m \geq 2$, respectively, and $n\geq 3$. Furthermore, we discuss toroidal grid graphs in the context of word-representability, which leads to an interesting conjecture.</description>

      <title>Integer sequences with conjectured relation with certain graph parameters of the family of linear Jaco graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This experimental study presents some interesting conjectured relations between some integer sequences and certain graph parameters of the family of linear Jaco graphs $J_n(x)$ where $n = 1,2,3,\dots$. It appears that $\textit{Golden ratio}$-like floor function terms play an important role in the analysis of the graph structural properties of the family of linear Jaco graphs. The experimental methodology to obtain the conjectures is indeed trivial. However, it is the author's view that the proofs or disproofs of the conjectures may be challenging.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture concerning the extensions of a reciprocal matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a reciprocal matrix of order $n$ and $w$ be its Perron eigenvector. To infer the efficiency of $w$ for $A$, based on the principle of Pareto optimal decisions, we study the strong connectivity of a certain digraph associated with $A$ and $w$. A reciprocal matrix $B$ of order $n+1$ is an extension of $A$ if the matrix $A$ is obtained from $B$ by removing its last row and column. We prove that there is no extension of a reciprocal matrix whose digraph associated with the extension and its Perron eigenvector has a source, as conjectured by Furtado and Johnson in ``Efficiency analysis for the Perron vector of a reciprocal matrix". As an application, considering $n\geq 5$ and $A$ a matrix obtained from a consistent one by perturbing four entries above the main diagonal, $x,y,z,a$, and the corresponding reciprocal entries, in a way that there is a submatrix of size $2$ containing the four perturbed entries and not containing a diagonal entry, we describe the relations among $x,y,z,a$ with which $A$ always has efficient Perron eigenvector.</description>

      <title>Solution to some conjectures on mobile position problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general position problem for graphs asks for the largest number of vertices in a subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ of a graph $G$ such that for any $u,v \in S$ and any shortest $u,v$-path $P$ we have $S \cap V(P) = \{ u,v\} $, whereas the mutual visibility problem requires only that for any $u,v \in S$ there exists a shortest $u,v$-path with $S \cap V(P) = \{ u,v\} $. In the mobile versions of these problems, robots must move through the network in general position/mutual visibility such that every vertex is visited by a robot. This paper solves some open problems from the literature. We quantify the effect of adding the restriction that every robot can visit every vertex (the so-called \emph{completely mobile} variants), prove a bound on both mobile numbers in terms of the clique number, and find the mobile mutual visibility number of line graphs of complete graphs, strong grids and Cartesian grids.</description>

      <title>A metrization theorem for edge-end spaces of infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the edge-end space of an infinite graph is metrizable if and only if it is first-countable. This strengthens a recent result by Aurichi, Magalhaes Jr.\ and Real (2024).
  Our central graph-theoretic tool is the use of tree-cut decompositions, introduced by Wollan (2015) as a variation of tree decompositions that is based on edge cuts instead of vertex separations. In particular, we give a new, elementary proof for Kurkofka's result (2022) that every infinite graph has a tree-cut decomposition of finite adhesion into its $\omega$-edge blocks. Along the way, we also give a new, short proof for a classic result by Halin (1984) on $K_{k,\kappa}$-subdivisions in $k$-connected graphs, making this paper self-contained.</description>

Abstract: Let $\bar{\Gamma}$ be the point-hyperplane geometry of a projective space $\mathrm{PG(V)},$ where $V$ is a $(n+1)$-dimensional vector space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of order $q.$ Suppose that $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider the projective embedding $\varepsilon_{\sigma}$ of $\bar{\Gamma}$ into the projective space $\mathrm{PG}(V\otimes V^*)$ mapping the point $([x],[\xi])\in \bar{\Gamma}$ to the projective point represented by the pure tensor $x^{\sigma}\otimes \xi$, with $\xi(x)=0.$ In [I.

Giuzzi, Linear codes arising from the point-hyperplane geometry -- part I: the Segre embedding (Jun. 2025). arXiv:2506.21309, doi:10.48550/ARXIV.2506.21309] we focused on the case $\sigma=1$ and we studied the projective code arising from the projective system $\Lambda_1=\varepsilon_{1}(\bar{\Gamma}).$ Here we focus on the case $\sigma\not=1$ and we investigate the linear code ${\mathcal C}(\Lambda_{\sigma})$ arising from the projective system $\Lambda_{\sigma}=\varepsilon_{\sigma}(\bar{\Gamma}).$ In particular, after having verified that $\mathcal{C}( \Lambda_{\sigma})$ is a minimal code, we determine its parameters, its minimum distance as well as its automorphism group. We also give a (geometrical) characterization of its minimum and second lowest weight codewords and determine its maximum weight when $q$ and $n$ are both odd.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complement-reducible graphs (or cographs) are the graphs formed from the single-vertex graph by the operations of complement and disjoint union. By combining the Johnson-Newman theorem on generalized cospectrality with the standard tools in the asymptotic enumeration of trees, we show that almost all cographs have a cospectral mate. This result can be viewed as an analogue to a well-known result by Schwenk, who proved that almost all trees have a cospectral mate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chapter presents mathematical models intended for creating a topological drawing of a non-separable non-planar graph based on the methods of G. Ringel's vertex rotation theory. The induced system of cycles generates a topological drawing of a certain thickness. A method for determining the location of imaginary vertices by finding the intersection of connections on a plane is presented. A topological drawing of a maximum planar subgraph is used as a basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that to each elliptic curve of the form $$y^2-axy-y=x^3-bx^2-cx,$$ we can associate a family of lattice paths whose step set is determined by the parameters of the elliptic curve. The enumeration of these lattice paths is by means of an associated Riordan array. The curves and the paths have associated Somos $4$ sequences which are essentially the same. For the curves the link to Somos $4$ sequences is a classical result, via the elliptic divisibility sequence. For the paths the link is via a Hankel transform.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Tur\'an numbers via edge-gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1984, Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits asked the following: given a bipartite graph $H$, do there exist constants $0 \leq \alpha &lt; 1$ and $\beta, C &gt; 0$ such that any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $pn^2\geq C n^{1+ \alpha}$ edges contains at least $\beta n^{\mathrm{v}(H)} p^{\mathrm{e}(H)}$ copies of $H$?
  We show that edge-gluing preserves the satisfiability of this conjecture under some mild symmetry conditions. Namely, if two graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ satisfy this conjecture, and if furthermore, gluing them along a fixed edge produces a unique graph then the resulting graph satisfies the conjecture as well. We also show that if $H$ satisfies the conjecture then if we glue several copies of (labeled) $H$ along the same labeled copy of a subforest of $H$ then the resulting graph also satisfies the conjecture.
  We also show that Zarankiewicz numbers are additive in the order of magnitude under gluing edges. Indeed, for a (signed) bipartite graph $H$ with parts coloured $+$ and $-$, recall $z(m,n, H)$ is the maximum number of edges in a signed bipartite graph $G$ with $+$ side being of size $m$ and $-$ side being of size $n$ such that $G$ does not contain a copy of $H$ with $+$ side embedded in the $+$ side of $G$. We show that for any two (signed) bipartite graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ if we glue them along an edge preserving the sign of the edge then the resulting graph $H$ satisfies $z(m,n, H) = \Theta(z(m,n, H_1) + z(m,n, H_2))$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the perfect matching function on $n$-vertex graphs requires monotone circuits of size $\smash{2^{n^{\Omega(1)}}}$. This improves on the $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ lower bound of Razborov (1985). Our proof uses the standard approximation method together with a new sunflower lemma for matchings.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit, embedded degeneration of the general torus orbit closure in the maximal orthogonal Grassmannian OG(n,2n+1) into a union of Richardson varieties. In particular, we deduce a formula for the cohomology class of the torus orbit closure, as a sum of products of Schubert classes. The moment map images of the degenerate pieces are the base polytopes of their underlying delta-matroids, and give a polyhedral decomposition of the unit hypercube.</description>

      <title>Last passage percolation in lower triangular domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Last passage percolation (LPP) in an $n\times n$ lower triangular domain has nice connections with various generalizations of Schur measures. LPP along an anti-diagonal, from $(1,n)$ to $(n,1)$, gives a distribution of a highest column of a random composition with respect to a Demazure measure (a non-symmetric analog of a Schur measure). LPP along a main diagonal, from $(1,1)$ to $(n,n)$, is distributed as a marginal of a Pfaffian Schur process. In the first case we show that the asymptotics for the constant specialization is governed by the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution, in the second case - by the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution. In the latter case we were also able to study the truncated lower triangular case, obtaining an interesting generalization of the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a purely combinatorial obstruction for the Bloch-Kato property within the class of fundamental groups of complement manifolds of toric arrangements (i.e., arrangements of hypersurfaces in the complex torus). As a stepping stone we obtain a combinatorial obstruction for the cohomology of a supersolvable arrangement to be generated in degree 1. Our result allows us to prove that - for all prime numbers $p$, the pro-$p$ completion of the pure braid group on $k$ strands has the Bloch-Kato property if and only if $k\leq 3$; - for all prime numbers $p$, the pro-$p$ completion of the pure mapping class group of the sphere $S^2$ with $k$ punctures has the Bloch-Kato property if and only if $k\leq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of communities in a graph entails identifying clusters of densely connected vertices; the area has a variety of important applications and a rich literature. The problem has previously been situated in the realm of error correcting codes by viewing a graph as a noisy version of the assumed underlying communities. In this paper, we introduce an encoding of community structure along with the resulting code's parameters. We then present a novel algorithm, SASH, to decode to estimated communities given an observed dataset. We demonstrate the performance of SASH via simulations on an assortative planted partition model and on the Zachary's Karate Club dataset.</description>

      <title>An unconditional lower bound for the active-set method in convex quadratic maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the active-set method needs an exponential number of iterations in the worst-case to maximize a convex quadratic function subject to linear constraints, regardless of the pivot rule used. This substantially improves over the best previously known lower bound [IPCO 2025], which needs objective functions of polynomial degrees $\omega(\log d)$ in dimension $d$, to a bound using a convex polynomial of degree 2. In particular, our result firmly resolves the open question [IPCO 2025] of whether a constant degree suffices, and it represents significant progress towards linear objectives, where the active-set method coincides with the simplex method and a lower bound for all pivot rules would constitute a major breakthrough.
  Our result is based on a novel extended formulation, recursively constructed using deformed products. Its key feature is that it projects onto a polygonal approximation of a parabola while preserving all of its exponentially many vertices. We define a quadratic objective that forces the active-set method to follow the parabolic boundary of this projection, without allowing any shortcuts along chords corresponding to edges of its full-dimensional preimage.</description>

      <title>To see the forest for the trees: On the infinite divisibility of unlabeled forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Stufler's recent probabilistic proof of Otter's asymptotic number of unlabeled trees, we revisit work of Palmer and Schwenk, and study unlabeled forests from a probabilistic point of view. We show that the number of trees in a random forest converges, with all of its moments, to a shifted compound Poisson. We also find the asymptotic proportion of forests that are trees. The key fact is that the number of trees $t_n$ and forests $f_n$ are related by a L\'evy process. As such, the results by Palmer and Schwenk follow by an earlier and far-reaching limit theory by Hawkes and Jenkins. We also show how this limit theory implies results by Schwenk and by Meir and Moon, related to degrees in large random trees. Our arguments apply, more generally, to the enumeration of sub-exponentially weighted integer partitions, or, in fact, any setting where the underlying L\'evy process follows the one big jump principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a random graph model $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$, which is a configuration model consisting of interior and boundary vertices. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues for graphs in $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$ under various growth regimes of $\chi$ and $n$. When $n = o\left(\chi^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)$, we prove that almost every graph in the model is connected and forms an expander family. We also establish upper bounds for the first Steklov eigenvalue, identifying scenarios in which expanders cannot be constructed. Furthermore, we explicitly construct an expanding family in the critical regime $n \asymp g$, and apply it to build a sequence of complete, noncompact hyperbolic surfaces with uniformly positive spectral gaps.</description>

      <title>A structural duality for path-decompositions into parts of small radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an easy observation that if a graph~$G$ admits a path-decomposition whose parts have small radius, then $G$ contains no large subdivision of $K_{1,3}$ or $K^3$ as a (quasi-)geodesic subgraph. We show that these are in fact the only obstructions to such path-decompositions of small radial width, and we prove analogous results for decompositions modelled on cycles and subdivided stars instead of paths.
  With our results we confirm in a strong form a conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu on fat-minor-characterisations of graphs quasi-isometric to paths, cycles and paths, and subdivided stars, respectively. For this, we present a novel view on quasi-isometries between graphs by graph-decompositions of bounded radial width and spread. This new perspective enables us to prove further results in coarse graph theory, and may thus be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $0&lt;\delta\leq 1$, let $R_k(m;\delta)$ denote the smallest $N$ such that every coloring of $k$-element subsets by two colors yields an $m$-element set $M$ with relative discrepancy $\delta$, which means that one color class has at least $(\frac{1+\delta}2){m\choose k}$ elements. The number $R_k(m;\delta)$ may be viewed as an extension of the usual $k$-hypergraph Ramsey number because $R_k(m)=R_k(m,1)$. Our main result is the following theorem.
  %\begin{theorem} For some constants $c,k_0$, and $\eps&gt;0$, and for all $k\geq k_0$, $c\log k\leq n\leq k/11$, \[ R_k(k+n);2^{-\eps n})\geq \tw_{\lfloor k/n\rfloor}(2). \] %\end{theorem}
  In particular, for $n=\lceil c\log k\rceil$, we get a tower of height $\delta k/\log k$ and relative discrepancy polynomial in~$k$.</description>

This set of functions can be expressed as the zero set of quadratic polynomials and our main result characterizes the number of complex irreducible components of this zero set in terms of combinatorial properties of the graph. In case the complex components are three-dimensional, then the graph is minimally rigid and the component number is a well-known invariant from rigidity theory. If the components are four-dimensional, then they correspond to one-dimensional coupler curves of flexible planar mechanisms. As an application, we characterize the degree of irreducible components of such coupler curves combinatorially.</description>

      <title>The chromatic symmetric function in the star-basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Stanley's chromatic symmetric function (CSF) for trees when expressed in the star-basis. We use the deletion-near-contraction algorithm recently introduced in \cite{ADOZ} to compute coefficients that occur in the CSF in the star-basis. In particular, one of our main results determines the smallest partition in lexicographic order that occurs as an indexing partition in the CSF, and we also give a formula for its coefficient. In addition to describing properties of trees encoded in the coefficients of the star-basis, we give two main applications of the leading coefficient result. The first is a strengthening of the result in \cite{ADOZ} that says that proper trees of diameter less than or equal to 5 can be reconstructed from their CSFs. In this paper we show that this is true for all trees of diameter less than or equal 5. In our second application, we show that the dimension of the subspace of symmetric functions spanned by the CSF of $n$-vertex trees is $p(n)-n+1$, where $p(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable induced subgraphs in graphs with complete bipartite induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a graph contains the complete bipartite graph $K_{134, 12}$ as an induced minor, then it contains a cycle of length at most~12 or a theta as an induced subgraph. With a longer and more technical proof, we prove that if a graph contains $K_{3, 4}$ as an induced minor, then it contains a triangle or a theta as an induced subgraph. Here, a \emph{theta} is a graph made of three internally vertex-disjoint chordless paths $P_1 = a \dots b$, $P_2 = a \dots b$, $P_3 = a \dots b$, each of length at least two, such that no edges exist between the paths except the three edges incident to $a$ and the three edges incident to $b$.
  A consequence is that excluding a grid and a complete bipartite graph as induced minors is not enough to guarantee a bounded tree-independence number, or even that the treewidth is bounded by a function of the size of the maximum clique, because the existence of graphs with large treewidth that contain no triangles or thetas as induced subgraphs is already known (the so-called layered wheels).</description>

      <title>Bounds on the realizations of zero-nonzero patterns and sign conditions of polynomials restricted to varieties and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds which are independent of the dimension of the ambient space, on the number of realizable zero-nonzero patterns as well as sign conditions (when the field of coefficients is ordered) of a finite set of polynomials $\mathcal{P}$ restricted to some algebraic subset $V$ of an affine or projective space. Our bounds depend on the number and the degrees of the polynomials in $\mathcal{P}$, as well as the degree of $V$ and the dimension of $V$, but are independent of the dimension of the space in which $V$ is embedded. This last feature of our bounds is useful in situations where the ambient dimension is much larger than $\mathrm{dim} V$. We give several applications of our results. We generalize existing results on bounding the $\varepsilon$-entropy of real varieties, as well as lower bounds in terms of the number of connected components for testing membership in semi-algebraic sets using algebraic computation trees. Motivated by quantum complexity theory we introduce a notion of relative rank (additive as well as multiplicative) in finite dimensional vector spaces and algebras relative to a fixed algebraic subset in the vector space or algebra -- which generalizes the classical definition of ranks of tensors. We prove a very general lower bound on the maximum relative rank of finite subsets relative to algebraic subsets of bounded degree and dimension which is independent of the dimension of the vector space or algebra.</description>

      <title>F\o{}lner, Banach, and translation density are equal and other new results about density in left amenable semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In any semigroup $S$ satisfying the Strong Folner Condition, there are three natural notions of density for a subset $A$ of $S$: Folner density $d(A)$, Banach density $d^*(A)$, and translation density $d_t(A)$. If $S$ is commutative or left cancellative, it is known that these three notions coincide. We shall show that these notions coincide for every semigroup $S$ which satisfies the Strong Folner Condition. Using this fact, we solve a problem that has been open for decades, showing that the set of ultrafilters every member of which has positive Folner density is a two sided ideal of $\beta S$. We also show that, if $S$ is a left amenable semigroup, then the set of ultrafilters every member of which has positive Banach density is a two sided ideal of $\beta S$. We investigate the density properties of subsets of $S$ in the case in which the minimal left ideals of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification $\beta S$ are singletons. This occurs in many familiar examples, including all semilattices and all semigroups which have a right zero. We show that this is equivalent to the statement that $S$ satisfies the Strong Folner Condition and that, for every subset $A$ of $S$, $d(A)\in \{0,1\}$. We also examine the relation between the density properties of two semigroups when one is a quotient of the other. The Folner density of a subset of $S$ is always determined by some Folner net in $S$. We show that an arbitrary Folner net in $S$ determines the density of all of the subsets of $S$. And we prove that, if $S$ and $T$ are left amenable semigroups, then $d^*(A\times B)=d^*(A)d^*(B)$ for every subset $A$ of $S$ and every subset $B$ of $T$.</description>

      <title>Coarse Balanced Separators and Tree-Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result of Robertson and Seymour (1986) states that the treewidth of a graph is linearly tied to its separation number: the smallest integer $k$ such that, for every weighting of the vertices, the graph admits a balanced separator of size at most $k$. Motivated by recent progress on coarse treewidth, Abrishami, Czy\.{z}ewska, Kluk, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\k{a}\.{z}ewski (2025) conjectured a coarse analogue to this result: every graph that has a balanced separator consisting of a bounded number of balls of bounded radius is quasi-isometric to a graph with bounded treewidth. In this paper, we confirm their conjecture for $K_{t,t}$-induced-subgraph-free graphs when the separator consists of a bounded number of balls of radius $1$. In doing so, we bridge two important conjectures concerning the structure of graphs that exclude a planar graph as an induced minor.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebraic interpretation of generalized Markov numbers and their matrixizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov numbers, i.e. positive integers appearing in solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$, can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables. The second author and Matsushita gave a generalization of the Markov equation, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1yz + k_2xz + k_3xy = (3+k_1+k_2+k_3)xyz$, whose solutions can be viewed as specializations of cluster variables in generalized cluster algebras. We give two families of matrices in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}[x_1^\pm,x_2^\pm,x_3^\pm])$ associated to these cluster structures. These matrix formulas relate to previous matrices appearing in the context of Markov numbers, including Cohn matrices and generalized Cohn matrices given by the second author, Maruyama, and Sato, as well as matrices appearing in the context of cluster algebras, including matrix formulas given by Kanatarc{\i} O\u{g}uz and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m. We provide a classification of the two families of matrices and exhibit an explicit family of each. The latter is done by realizing cluster variables in generalized Markov cluster algebras as weight-generating functions of order ideals in certain fence posets which are related to Christoffel words. An interesting observation is that these functions resemble Caldero-Chapoton functions for string modules, and a byproduct of our proofs is a new skein-like formula for such functions.</description>

Abstract: Semi-directed networks provide a graphical structure for describing the evolutionary history of organisms in the presence of hybridization. We introduce two algorithms for reconstructing semi-directed level-1 phylogenetic networks from their complete set of 4-leaf subnetworks, known as quarnets. The sequential algorithm begins with a single quarnet and adds one leaf at a time until the entire network has been reconstructed. The cherry-blob algorithm is a novel approach inspired by cherry-picking techniques on trees</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random Peano paths on planar square grids that arise from fair random spanning trees. These are trees that are sampled in such a way as to have the same (if possible) edge probabilities. In particular, we are interested in identifying the scaling limit as the mesh-size of the grid tends to zero. It is known \cite{lawler-schramm-werner2002} that if the trees are sampled uniformly, then the scaling limit exists and equals ${\rm SLE}_8$. We show that if we simply follow the same steps as in \cite{lawler-schramm-werner2002}, then fair Peano paths have a deterministic scaling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Karp--Sipser core of a random graph made of a configuration model with vertices of degree $1,2$ and $3$. This core is obtained by recursively removing the leaves as well as their unique neighbors in the graph. We settle a conjecture of Bauer &amp; Golinelli and prove that at criticality, the Karp--Sipser core has size $ \approx \mathrm{Cst} \cdot \vartheta^{-2} \cdot n^{3/5}$ where $\vartheta$ is the hitting time of the curve $t \mapsto \frac{1}{t^{2}}$ by a linear Brownian motion started at $0$. Our proof relies on a detailed multi-scale analysis of the Markov chain associated to Karp-Sipser leaf-removal algorithm close to its extinction time.</description>

      <title>Closing the complexity gap of the double distance problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement has been an active area of research in computational comparative genomics for the last three decades. While initially mostly an interesting algorithmic endeavor, now the practical application by applying rearrangement distance methods and more advanced phylogenetic tasks is becoming common practice, given the availability of many completely sequenced genomes. Several genome rearrangement models have been developed over time, sometimes with surprising computational properties. A prominent example is the fact that computing the reversal distance of two signed permutations is possible in linear time, while for two unsigned permutations it is NP-hard. Therefore one has always to be careful about the precise problem formulation and complexity analysis of rearrangement problems in order not to be fooled. The double distance is the minimum number of genomic rearrangements between a singular and a duplicated genome that, in addition to rearrangements, are separated by a whole genome duplication. At the same time it allows to assign the genes of the duplicated genome to the two paralogous chromosome copies that existed right after the duplication event. Computing the double distance is another example of a tricky hardness landscape: If the distance measure underlying the double distance is the simple breakpoint distance, the problem can be solved in linear time, while with the more elaborate DCJ distance it is NP-hard. Indeed, there is a family of distance measures, parameterized by an even number k, between the breakpoint distance (k=2) and the DCJ distance (k=\infty). Little was known about the hardness border between these extremes; the problem complexity was known only for k=4 and k=6. In this paper, we close the gap, providing a full picture of the hardness landscape when computing the double distance.</description>

Abstract: De Loera, O'Neill and Wilburne introduced a general model for random numerical semigroups in which each positive integer is chosen independently with some probability p to be a generator, and proved upper and lower bounds on the expected Frobenius number and expected embedding dimensions. We use a range of probabilistic methods to improve the upper bounds to within a polylogarithmic factor of the lower bounds in each case. As one of the tools to do this, we prove that for any prime q, if A is a random subset of the cyclic group Z_q whose size is of order log(q) and k is also of order log(q), then with high probability the k-fold sumset kA is all of Z_q.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the decoding of the rank metric Reed--Muller codes introduced by Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri in 2021. These codes are defined from Abelian Galois extensions extending the construction of Gabidulin codes over arbitrary cyclic Galois extensions. We propose a polynomial time algorithm that rests on the structure of Dickson matrices, works on any such code and corrects any error of rank up to half the minimum distance.</description>

      <title>A divisor generating $q$-series and cumulants arising from random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uchimura, in 1987, introduced a probability generating function for a random variable $X$ and using properties of this function he discovered an interesting $q$-series identity. He further showed that the $m$-th cumulant with respect to the random variable $X$ is nothing but the generating function for the generalized divisor function $\sigma_{m-1}(n)$. Simon, Crippa, and Collenberg, in 1993, explored the $G_{n,p}$-model of a random acyclic digraph and defined a random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$. Quite interestingly, they found links between limit of its mean and the generating function for the divisor function $d(n)$. Later in 1997, Andrews, Crippa and Simon extended these results using $q$-series techniques. They calculated limit of the mean and variance of the random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$ which correspond to the first and second cumulants. In this paper, we generalize the result of Andrews, Crippa and Simon by calculating limit of the $t$-th cumulant in terms of the generalized divisor function. Furthermore, we also discover limit forms for identities of Uchimura and Dilcher. This provides a fourth side to the Uchimura-Ramanujan-divisor type three way partition identities expounded by the first four authors recently.</description>

      <title>Geometric designs and Hilbert-Kamke equations of degree five for classical orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs, or Chebyshev-type quadrature, for classical orthogonal polynomials. We first establish that if a $5$-design with $6$ rational points for a symmetric classical measure is parametrized by rational functions, then the corresponding measure should be the Chebyshev measure $(1-t^2)^{-1/2}dt/\pi$ on $(-1,1)$. Our proof is based on the collaboration of a certain polynomial identity and some advanced techniques on the computation of the genus of a certain irreducible curve. Next, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure. Moreover, as one of our main theorems, we construct an infinite family of ideal solutions for the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem by utilizing rational $5$-designs for the Chebyshev measure, and then establish that, up to affine equivalence over $\mathbb{Q}$, such ideal solutions are included in the famous parametric solutions found by Borwein (2002).</description>
