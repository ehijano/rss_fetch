      <title>Futga: Towards Fine-grained Music Understanding through Temporally-enhanced Generative Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing music captioning methods are limited to generating concise global descriptions of short music clips, which fail to capture fine-grained musical characteristics and time-aware musical changes. To address these limitations, we propose FUTGA, a model equipped with fined-grained music understanding capabilities through learning from generative augmentation with temporal compositions. We leverage existing music caption datasets and large language models (LLMs) to synthesize fine-grained music captions with structural descriptions and time boundaries for full-length songs. Augmented by the proposed synthetic dataset, FUTGA is enabled to identify the music's temporal changes at key transition points and their musical functions, as well as generate detailed descriptions for each music segment. We further introduce a full-length music caption dataset generated by FUTGA, as the augmentation of the MusicCaps and the Song Describer datasets. We evaluate the automatically generated captions on several downstream tasks, including music generation and retrieval. The experiments demonstrate the quality of the generated captions and the better performance in various downstream tasks achieved by the proposed music captioning approach. Our code and datasets can be found in \href{https://huggingface.co/JoshuaW1997/FUTGA}{\textcolor{blue}{https://huggingface.co/JoshuaW1997/FUTGA}}.</description>

      <title>SuperCodec: A Neural Speech Codec with Selective Back-Projection Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural speech coding is a rapidly developing topic, where state-of-the-art approaches now exhibit superior compression performance than conventional methods. Despite significant progress, existing methods still have limitations in preserving and reconstructing fine details for optimal reconstruction, especially at low bitrates. In this study, we introduce SuperCodec, a neural speech codec that achieves state-of-the-art performance at low bitrates. It employs a novel back projection method with selective feature fusion for augmented representation. Specifically, we propose to use Selective Up-sampling Back Projection (SUBP) and Selective Down-sampling Back Projection (SDBP) modules to replace the standard up- and down-sampling layers at the encoder and decoder, respectively. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing neural speech codecs operating at various bitrates. Specifically, our proposed method can achieve higher quality reconstructed speech at 1 kbps than Lyra V2 at 3.2 kbps and Encodec at 6 kbps.</description>

      <title>Abusive Speech Detection in Indic Languages Using Acoustic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abusive content in online social networks is a well-known problem that can cause serious psychological harm and incite hatred. The ability to upload audio data increases the importance of developing methods to detect abusive content in speech recordings. However, simply transferring the mechanisms from written abuse detection would ignore relevant information such as emotion and tone. In addition, many current algorithms require training in the specific language for which they are being used. This paper proposes to use acoustic and prosodic features to classify abusive content. We used the ADIMA data set, which contains recordings from ten Indic languages, and trained different models in multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that it is possible to classify abusive and non-abusive content using only acoustic and prosodic features. The most important and influential features are discussed.</description>

      <title>PiCoGen: Generate Piano Covers with a Two-stage Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cover song generation stands out as a popular way of music making in the music-creative community. In this study, we introduce Piano Cover Generation (PiCoGen), a two-stage approach for automatic cover song generation that transcribes the melody line and chord progression of a song given its audio recording, and then uses the resulting lead sheet as the condition to generate a piano cover in the symbolic domain. This approach is advantageous in that it does not required paired data of covers and their original songs for training. Compared to an existing approach that demands such paired data, our evaluation shows that PiCoGen demonstrates competitive or even superior performance across songs of different musical genres.</description>

      <title>Emotion-driven Piano Music Generation via Two-stage Disentanglement and Functional Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing the emotional aspect remains a challenge in automatic music generation. Prior works aim to learn various emotions at once, leading to inadequate modeling. This paper explores the disentanglement of emotions in piano performance generation through a two-stage framework. The first stage focuses on valence modeling of lead sheet, and the second stage addresses arousal modeling by introducing performance-level attributes. To further capture features that shape valence, an aspect less explored by previous approaches, we introduce a novel functional representation of symbolic music. This representation aims to capture the emotional impact of major-minor tonality, as well as the interactions among notes, chords, and key signatures. Objective and subjective experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in both emotional valence and arousal modeling. We further leverage our framework in a novel application of emotional controls, showing a broad potential in emotion-driven music generation.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Deep Learning Models for Direct Respiratory Insufficiency Detection Versus Blood Oxygen Saturation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We contrast high effectiveness of state of the art deep learning architectures designed for general audio classification tasks, refined for respiratory insufficiency (RI) detection and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) estimation and classification through automated audio analysis. Recently, multiple deep learning architectures have been proposed to detect RI in COVID patients through audio analysis, achieving accuracy above 95% and F1-score above 0.93. RI is a condition associated with low SpO2 levels, commonly defined as the threshold SpO2 &lt;92%. While SpO2 serves as a crucial determinant of RI, a medical doctor's diagnosis typically relies on multiple factors. These include respiratory frequency, heart rate, SpO2 levels, among others. Here we study pretrained audio neural networks (CNN6, CNN10 and CNN14) and the Masked Autoencoder (Audio-MAE) for RI detection, where these models achieve near perfect accuracy, surpassing previous results. Yet, for the regression task of estimating SpO2 levels, the models achieve root mean square error values exceeding the accepted clinical range of 3.5% for finger oximeters. Additionally, Pearson correlation coefficients fail to surpass 0.3. As deep learning models perform better in classification than regression, we transform SpO2-regression into a SpO2-threshold binary classification problem, with a threshold of 92%. However, this task still yields an F1-score below 0.65. Thus, audio analysis offers valuable insights into a patient's RI status, but does not provide accurate information about actual SpO2 levels, indicating a separation of domains in which voice and speech biomarkers may and may not be useful in medical diagnostics under current technologies.</description>

      <title>DeepSpeech models show Human-like Performance and Processing of Cochlear Implant Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cochlear implants(CIs) are arguably the most successful neural implant, having restored hearing to over one million people worldwide. While CI research has focused on modeling the cochlear activations in response to low-level acoustic features, we hypothesize that the success of these implants is due in large part to the role of the upstream network in extracting useful features from a degraded signal and learned statistics of language to resolve the signal. In this work, we use the deep neural network (DNN) DeepSpeech2, as a paradigm to investigate how natural input and cochlear implant-based inputs are processed over time. We generate naturalistic and cochlear implant-like inputs from spoken sentences and test the similarity of model performance to human performance on analogous phoneme recognition tests. Our model reproduces error patterns in reaction time and phoneme confusion patterns under noise conditions in normal hearing and CI participant studies. We then use interpretability techniques to determine where and when confusions arise when processing naturalistic and CI-like inputs. We find that dynamics over time in each layer are affected by context as well as input type. Dynamics of all phonemes diverge during confusion and comprehension within the same time window, which is temporally shifted backward in each layer of the network. There is a modulation of this signal during processing of CI which resembles changes in human EEG signals in the auditory stream. This reduction likely relates to the reduction of encoded phoneme identity. These findings suggest that we have a viable model in which to explore the loss of speech-related information in time and that we can use it to find population-level encoding signals to target when optimizing cochlear implant inputs to improve encoding of essential speech-related information and improve perception.</description>

      <title>EgoSonics: Generating Synchronized Audio for Silent Egocentric Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EgoSonics, a method to generate semantically meaningful and synchronized audio tracks conditioned on silent egocentric videos. Generating audio for silent egocentric videos could open new applications in virtual reality, assistive technologies, or for augmenting existing datasets. Existing work has been limited to domains like speech, music, or impact sounds and cannot easily capture the broad range of audio frequencies found in egocentric videos. EgoSonics addresses these limitations by building on the strength of latent diffusion models for conditioned audio synthesis. We first encode and process audio and video data into a form that is suitable for generation. The encoded data is used to train our model to generate audio tracks that capture the semantics of the input video. Our proposed SyncroNet builds on top of ControlNet to provide control signals that enables temporal synchronization to the synthesized audio. Extensive evaluations show that our model outperforms existing work in audio quality, and in our newly proposed synchronization evaluation method. Furthermore, we demonstrate downstream applications of our model in improving video summarization.</description>

      <title>Decoding Linguistic Representations of Human Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language, as an information medium created by advanced organisms, has always been a concern of neuroscience regarding how it is represented in the brain. Decoding linguistic representations in the evoked brain has shown groundbreaking achievements, thanks to the rapid improvement of neuroimaging, medical technology, life sciences and artificial intelligence. In this work, we present a taxonomy of brain-to-language decoding of both textual and speech formats. This work integrates two types of research: neuroscience focusing on language understanding and deep learning-based brain decoding. Generating discernible language information from brain activity could not only help those with limited articulation, especially amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients but also open up a new way for the next generation's brain-computer interface (BCI). This article will help brain scientists and deep-learning researchers to gain a bird's eye view of fine-grained language perception, and thus facilitate their further investigation and research of neural process and language decoding.</description>

      <title>Integrating audiological datasets via federated merging of Auditory Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audiological datasets contain valuable knowledge about hearing loss in patients, which can be uncovered using data-driven, federated learning techniques. Our previous approach summarized patient information from one audiological dataset into distinct Auditory Profiles (APs). To cover the complete audiological patient population, however, patient patterns must be analyzed across multiple, separated datasets, and finally, be integrated into a combined set of APs. This study aimed at extending the existing profile generation pipeline with an AP merging step, enabling the combination of APs from different datasets based on their similarity across audiological measures. The 13 previously generated APs (NA=595) were merged with 31 newly generated APs from a second dataset (NB=1272) using a similarity score derived from the overlapping densities of common features across the two datasets. To ensure clinical applicability, random forest models were created for various scenarios, encompassing different combinations of audiological measures. A new set with 13 combined APs is proposed, providing well-separable profiles, which still capture detailed patient information from various test outcome combinations. The classification performance across these profiles is satisfactory. The best performance was achieved using a combination of loudness scaling, audiogram and speech test information, while single measures performed worst. The enhanced profile generation pipeline demonstrates the feasibility of combining APs across datasets, which should generalize to all datasets and could lead to an interpretable population-based profile set in the future. The classification models maintain clinical applicability. Hence, even if only smartphone-based measures are available, a given patient can be classified into an appropriate AP.</description>

      <title>MMTrail: A Multimodal Trailer Video Dataset with Language and Music Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multi-modality datasets play a significant role in facilitating the success of large video-language models. However, current video-language datasets primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames, considering audio to be weakly related information. They usually overlook exploring the potential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous annotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise descriptions. Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple cross-modality studies. To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale multi-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips with visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions. Trailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames, and background music. In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1) the topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g., film, news, and gaming. (2) the corresponding background music is custom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context. Upon these insights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos. Here, to ensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations adaptively. In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training. In experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, demonstrating the high quality of our annotation and its effectiveness for model training.</description>

      <title>ROSE: A Recognition-Oriented Speech Enhancement Framework in Air Traffic Control Using Multi-Objective Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio speech echo is a specific phenomenon in the air traffic control (ATC) domain, which degrades speech quality and further impacts automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. In this work, a time-domain recognition-oriented speech enhancement (ROSE) framework is proposed to improve speech intelligibility and also advance ASR accuracy based on convolutional encoder-decoder-based U-Net framework, which serves as a plug-and-play tool in ATC scenarios and does not require additional retraining of the ASR model. Specifically, 1) In the U-Net architecture, an attention-based skip-fusion (ABSF) module is applied to mine shared features from encoders using an attention mask, which enables the model to effectively fuse the hierarchical features. 2) A channel and sequence attention (CSAtt) module is innovatively designed to guide the model to focus on informative features in dual parallel attention paths, aiming to enhance the effective representations and suppress the interference noises. 3) Based on the handcrafted features, ASR-oriented optimization targets are designed to improve recognition performance in the ATC environment by learning robust feature representations. By incorporating both the SE-oriented and ASR-oriented losses, ROSE is implemented in a multi-objective learning manner by optimizing shared representations across the two task objectives. The experimental results show that the ROSE significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for both the SE and ASR tasks, in which all the proposed improvements are confirmed by designed experiments. In addition, the proposed approach can contribute to the desired performance improvements on public datasets.</description>

      <title>Audio Conditioning for Music Generation via Discrete Bottleneck Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While most music generation models use textual or parametric conditioning (e.g. tempo, harmony, musical genre), we propose to condition a language model based music generation system with audio input. Our exploration involves two distinct strategies. The first strategy, termed textual inversion, leverages a pre-trained text-to-music model to map audio input to corresponding "pseudowords" in the textual embedding space. For the second model we train a music language model from scratch jointly with a text conditioner and a quantized audio feature extractor. At inference time, we can mix textual and audio conditioning and balance them thanks to a novel double classifier free guidance method. We conduct automatic and human studies that validates our approach. We will release the code and we provide music samples on https://musicgenstyle.github.io in order to show the quality of our model.</description>

      <title>RAVSS: Robust Audio-Visual Speech Separation in Multi-Speaker Scenarios with Missing Visual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While existing Audio-Visual Speech Separation (AVSS) methods primarily concentrate on the audio-visual fusion strategy for two-speaker separation, they demonstrate a severe performance drop in the multi-speaker separation scenarios. Typically, AVSS methods employ guiding videos to sequentially isolate individual speakers from the given audio mixture, resulting in notable missing and noisy parts across various segments of the separated speech. In this study, we propose a simultaneous multi-speaker separation framework that can facilitate the concurrent separation of multiple speakers within a singular process. We introduce speaker-wise interactions to establish distinctions and correlations among speakers. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb2 and LRS3 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in separating mixtures with 2, 3, 4, and 5 speakers, respectively. Additionally, our model can utilize speakers with complete audio-visual information to mitigate other visual-deficient speakers, thereby enhancing its resilience to missing visual cues. We also conduct experiments where visual information for specific speakers is entirely absent or visual frames are partially missing. The results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms others, exhibiting the smallest performance drop across all settings involving 2, 3, 4, and 5 speakers.</description>

Abstract: Most current audio-visual emotion recognition models lack the flexibility needed for deployment in practical applications. We envision a multimodal system that works even when only one modality is available and can be implemented interchangeably for either predicting emotional attributes or recognizing categorical emotions. Achieving such flexibility in a multimodal emotion recognition system is difficult due to the inherent challenges in accurately interpreting and integrating varied data sources. It is also a challenge to robustly handle missing or partial information while allowing direct switch between regression or classification tasks. This study proposes a versatile audio-visual learning (VAVL) framework for handling unimodal and multimodal systems for emotion regression or emotion classification tasks. We implement an audio-visual framework that can be trained even when audio and visual paired data is not available for part of the training set (i.e., audio only or only video is present). We achieve this effective representation learning with audio-visual shared layers, residual connections over shared layers, and a unimodal reconstruction task. Our experimental results reveal that our architecture significantly outperforms strong baselines on the CREMA-D, MSP-IMPROV, and CMU-MOSEI corpora. Notably, VAVL attains a new state-of-the-art performance in the emotional attribute prediction task on the MSP-IMPROV corpus.</description>

      <title>EMO-Codec: An In-Depth Look at Emotion Preservation capacity of Legacy and Neural Codec Models With Subjective and Objective Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15458</link>

Abstract: The neural codec model reduces speech data transmission delay and serves as the foundational tokenizer for speech language models (speech LMs). Preserving emotional information in codecs is crucial for effective communication and context understanding. However, there is a lack of studies on emotion loss in existing codecs. This paper evaluates neural and legacy codecs using subjective and objective methods on emotion datasets like IEMOCAP. Our study identifies which codecs best preserve emotional information under various bitrate scenarios. We found that training codec models with both English and Chinese data had limited success in retaining emotional information in Chinese. Additionally, resynthesizing speech through these codecs degrades the performance of speech emotion recognition (SER), particularly for emotions like sadness, depression, fear, and disgust. Human listening tests confirmed these findings. This work guides future speech technology developments to ensure new codecs maintain the integrity of emotional information in speech.</description>
