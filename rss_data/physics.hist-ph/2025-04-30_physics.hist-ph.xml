      <title>How to be an orthodox quantum mechanic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work sets out to answer a single question: what is the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics? However, we adopt a different approach to that normally used. Rather than carefully surveying the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we extract an orthodoxy empirically. To do this we review a collection of 33 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 12 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy is largely unchanged over the past century, with some interesting emerging deviations, and has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints. However, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense it down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has two main pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states and these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles. More fully it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently changes its state in a random fashion, manifesting in a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.</description>
