      <title>The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pfloos/QUESTDB.</description>

      <title>Entropy governs the structure and reactivity of water dissociation under electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of water to electric fields is critical to the performance and stability of electrochemical devices, and the selectivity of enzymatic, atmospheric, and organic reactions. A key process in this context is the water (auto)dissociation reaction (WD), which governs acid-base aqueous chemistry and shapes reaction rates and mechanisms. Despite its significance, the thermodynamics of the WD reaction in electrified environments remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the WD reaction under external electric fields using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations within the framework of the modern theory of polarization. Our results reveal that strong electric fields dramatically enhance the WD reaction, increasing the equilibrium constant by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we show that the applied field transforms the WD reaction from an entropically hindered process to an entropy-driven one. Analysis shows that this is because the electric field alters the tendency of ions to be structure makers or structure breakers. By highlighting how strong electric fields reshape solvent organization and reactivity, this work opens new avenues for designing aqueous electro-catalysts that leverage solvent entropy to enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>Conical Intersections and Electronic Momentum As Viewed From Phase Space Electronic Structure Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of a prototypical two-state conical intersection (BeH$_2$) using a phase space electronic Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{PS}(\bR,\bP)$ that goes beyond the Born-Oppenheimer framework. By parameterizing the electronic Schr{\"o}dinger equation by both nuclear position ($\bR$) and momentum ($\bP$), we solve for quantum electronic states in a moving frame that can break time reversal symmetry and, as a result, the branching plane of the conical intersection within a phase space framework now has dimension three (rather than dimension two as found within the standard Born-Oppenheimer framework). Moreover, we note that, if one fixes a geometry in real space that lies in the conical intersection seam and scans over the corresponding momentum space, one finds a double well (with minima at $\pm \bP_{min} \ne 0$), indicating that the stationary electronic states of the phase space electronic Hamiltonian carry electronic momentum -- a feature that cannot be captured by a Born-Oppenheimer electronic state. Interestingly, for $BeH_2$, this electronic momenta (as calculated with full configuration interaction) agrees with what is predicted by approximate complex restricted Hartree-Fock calculations, indicating a physical interpretation of complex instabilities in modern electronic structure calculations. Altogether, this study suggests that we have still have a lot to learn about conical intersections when it comes to electronic momentum, and highlights the urgent need for more experiments to probe what photochemical observables can and/or cannot be captured by standard electronic structure that isolates conical intersections within the Born-Oppenheimer framework.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to numerically evaluate functional integrals called integral decimation (ID). It constructs a separable decomposition of the integrand as a spectral tensor train (STT), a continuous generalization of the matrix product state. ID builds the STT by mapping the integrand to an auxiliary many-body wavefunction that evolves in time from an initially unentangled state. Each body-ordered term of the action corresponds to a quantum gate, applied to the state during its evolution. The gates generate entanglement, and decimation during the gate sequence compresses the integral, alleviating memory bottlenecks in high dimensional integration. In the application of ID to moment-generating and partition functions, the continuous nature of the STTs allows for analytical differentiation of the result. To demonstrate its versatility, we employ ID to calculate the partition function of a classical XY model and to solve a non-Markovian quantum relaxation problem. By circumventing the barren plateau problem that limited our earlier STT-based approaches to quantum relaxation [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 234111 (2024)], ID enables high-accuracy simulations of quantum dynamics in systems as large as a 40-site chain.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11576v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.</description>

      <title>Imaging scattering resonances in low-energy inelastic ND$_3$-H$_2$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scattering resonance is one of the most striking quantum effects in low-temperature molecular collisions. Predicted decades ago theoretically, they have only been resolved experimentally for systems involving at most four atoms. Extension to more complex systems is essential to probe the true quantum nature of chemically more relevant processes, but is thus far hampered by major obstacles. Here, we present a joint experimental and theoretical study of scattering resonances in state-to-state inelastic collisions for the six-atom ND$_3$-H$_2$/HD systems across the collision energy range 0.5-25 cm$^{-1}$, bringing this type of experiment into the realm of polyatomic symmetric top molecules. Strong resonances are resolved in the integral cross sections, whereas differential cross sections are measured with high resolution using a laser ionization scheme involving VUV light. The experimental data could only be reproduced using theoretical predictions based on a potential energy surface at the CCSD(T) level of theory with corrections at the CCSDT(Q) level.</description>

      <title>Teacher-student training improves accuracy and efficiency of machine learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the field of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Recent MLIPs have tended towards more complex architectures trained on larger datasets. The resulting increase in computational and memory costs may prohibit the application of these MLIPs to perform large-scale MD simulations. Here, we present a teacher-student training framework in which the latent knowledge from the teacher (atomic energies) is used to augment the students' training. We show that the light-weight student MLIPs have faster MD speeds at a fraction of the memory footprint compared to the teacher models. Remarkably, the student models can even surpass the accuracy of the teachers, even though both are trained on the same quantum chemistry dataset. Our work highlights a practical method for MLIPs to reduce the resources required for large-scale MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Knowledge Distillation for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) strongly depends on the quantity of training data as well as the quantum chemistry (QC) level of theory used. Datasets generated with high-fidelity QC methods are typically restricted to small molecules and may be missing energy gradients, which make it difficult to train accurate MLIPs. We present an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method to improve MLIP accuracy when trained to energy-only datasets. First, multiple teacher models are trained to QC energies and then generate atomic forces for all configurations in the dataset. Next, the student MLIP is trained to both QC energies and to ensemble-averaged forces generated by the teacher models. We apply this workflow on the ANI-1ccx dataset where the configuration energies computed at the coupled cluster level of theory. The resulting student MLIPs achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on the COMP6 benchmark and show improved stability for molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>DFT+U+J with linear response parameters predicts non-magnetic oxide band gaps with hybrid-functional accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-principles Hubbard-corrected approximate density-functional theory (DFT+U) is a low-cost, potentially high throughput method of simulating materials, but it has been hampered by empiricism and inconsistent band-gap correction in transition-metal oxides. DFT+U property prediction of non-magnetic systems such as d0 and d10 transition-metal oxides is typically faced with excessively large calculated Hubbard U values, and with difficulty in obtaining acceptable band-gaps and lattice volumes. Meanwhile, Hund's exchange coupling J is an important but often neglected component of DFT+U, and the J parameter has proven challenging to directly calculate by means of linear response. In this work, we provide a revised formula for computing Hund's J using established self-consistent field DFT+U codes. For non-magnetic systems, we introduce a non-approximate technique for calculating U and J simultaneously in such codes, at no additional cost. Using unmodified Quantum ESPRESSO, we assess the resulting values using two different DFT+U functionals incorporating J, namely the widely used DFT+(U-J) and the readily available DFT+U+J. We assess a test set comprising TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, Cu2O and ZnO, and apply the corrections both to metal and oxygen centered pseudoatomic subspaces. Starting from the PBE functional, we find that DFT+(U-J) is significantly out-performed in band-gap accuracy by DFT+U+J, the mean absolute band-gap error of which matches that of the hybrid functional HSE06. ZnO, a long-standing challenge case for DFT+U, is addressed by means of Zn 4s instead of Zn 3d correction, whereupon the first-principles DFT+U+J band-gap error falls to half of that reported for HSE06, yet remains larger than for PBE0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10451v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled-cluster and Green's function theories are highly successful in treating many-body electron correlation and there has been significant interest in identifying and leveraging connections between them. Here we present a diagrammatic definition of the irreducible coupled-cluster self-energy that directly embeds coupled-cluster theory within the framework of many-body field theory. The EOM-CC treatment emerges naturally from our definition via the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, providing a unified description of RPA, $GW$-BSE and CC theory for ground state and excitation energies. This clarifies the origin of previously established connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory, and exposes the relationship between vertex corrections and the coupled-cluster amplitude equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nernst heat theorem is probed from purely thermodynamic arguments connected with the second law of thermodynamics, and alien to the vanishing of the specific heats, or to the unattainability of the zeroth isotherm. If the proof is accepted the second law of thermodynamics would extend its applicability and the third postulate of thermodynamics would be narrowed to the fact that the entropy of a finite-density, chemically homogeneous body must not be negative.

Si se acepta la demostraci\'on, entonces el segundo principio extender\'ia su rango de aplicabilidad y el tercer principio quedar\'ia reducido al hecho de que la entrop\'ia de un cuerpo de densidad finita y quimicamente homog\'eneo no puede ser negativa.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part II: non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</description>
