      <title>Mathematical models for the EP2 and EP4 signaling pathways and their crosstalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The G-protein coupled receptors EP2 and EP4 both transduce the signal of the lipid messenger Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Changes in the cell response to PGE2 can have important effects on immunity and development of diseases, however, a thorough understanding of the EP2-EP4 receptors' signaling pathways is lacking. Experimental data show that receptor activity (indicated by cAMP expression) has a different kinetics depending on which receptor is triggered by PGE2 and that crosstalk exists between EP2 and EP4. To better understand the underlying mechanisms and be able to predict cell responses to PGE2, we develop novel mathematical models for the cAMP signaling pathways of EP2 and EP4 and their crosstalk. Ligand binding dynamics plays a crucial role for both, the single receptor activity and their crosstalk. The mathematical models can predict the qualitative cAMP levels observed experimentally and provide possible explanations for the differences and commonalities in the signaling behavior of EP2 and EP4. As inhibition of PGE2 signaling is gaining increasing attention in tumor immunology, these mathematical models could contribute to design effective anti-tumor therapies targeting EP2 and EP4.</description>

      <title>State- versus Reaction-Based Information Processing in Biochemical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory mutual information is frequently used to quantify information transfer in biochemical systems. Tractable solutions of the trajectory mutual information can be obtained via the widely used Linear-Noise Approximation (LNA) using Gaussian channel theory. This approach is expected to be accurate for sufficiently large systems. However, recent observations show that there are cases, where the mutual information obtained this way differs qualitatively from results derived using an exact Markov jump process formalism, and that the differences persist even for large systems. In this letter, we show that these differences can be explained by introducing the notion of reaction- versus state-based descriptions of trajectories. In chemical systems, the information is encoded in the sequence of reaction events, and the reaction-based trajectories of Markov jump processes capture this information. In contrast, the commonly used form of the LNA uses a state (concentration) based description of trajectories, which contains, in general, less information than a reaction-based description. Here, we show that an alternative formulation of the LNA that retains the reaction-specific information of trajectories can accurately describe the trajectory mutual information for large systems. We illustrate the consequences of different trajectory descriptions for two common cellular reaction motifs and discuss the connection with Berg-Purcell and Maximum-Likelihood sensing.</description>

      <title>AdaptMol: Adaptive Fusion from Sequence String to Topological Structure for Few-shot Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction (MPP) is a critical step in modern drug development. However, the scarcity of experimental validation data poses a significant challenge to AI-driven research paradigms. Under few-shot learning scenarios, the quality of molecular representations directly dictates the theoretical upper limit of model performance. We present AdaptMol, a prototypical network integrating Adaptive multimodal fusion for Molecular representation. This framework employs a dual-level attention mechanism to dynamically integrate global and local molecular features derived from two modalities: SMILES sequences and molecular graphs. (1) At the local level, structural features such as atomic interactions and substructures are extracted from molecular graphs, emphasizing fine-grained topological information; (2) At the global level, the SMILES sequence provides a holistic representation of the molecule. To validate the necessity of multimodal adaptive fusion, we propose an interpretable approach based on identifying molecular active substructures to demonstrate that multimodal adaptive fusion can efficiently represent molecules. Extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmarks under 5-shot and 10-shot settings demonstrate that AdaptMol achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases. The rationale-extracted method guides the fusion of two modalities and highlights the importance of both modalities.</description>

      <title>Stability in Reaction Network Models via an Extension of the Next Generation Matrix Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this essay, we investigate some relations between Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) and Mathematical Epidemiology (ME) and report on several pleasant surprises which we had simply by putting these two topics together.
  Firstly, we propose a definition of ME models as a subset of CRN models.
  Secondly, we review a fundamental stability result for boundary points, known in ME as the NGM method since it replaces the investigation of the Jacobian by that of a matrix whose origins lie in probability (the theory of branching processes). This important result seems to be little known outside of ME; even in ME, it has not been made clear before that the method gets sometimes the right answer, even though the conditions of the NGM theorem are not all satisfied. Thus, beyond the theorem, there is a heuristic approach, the validity conditions for which are not sufficiently understood.
  Thirdly, we show that some simple CRN models with absolute concentration robustness (ACR), are close qualitatively to simple ME models, in the sense that they have an unique disease free equilibrium, and a unique interior fixed point, and the latter enters the positive domain and becomes stable precisely when $R_0:=s_{dfe} \mathcal{R}=\frac{s_{dfe}}{s_e}&gt;1.$
  (where $s$ denotes the "ACR species"). Thus, for these "ME type models", a "relay phenomena" takes place: precisely when the DFE loses stability, a new fixed point enters the domain, and takes over.
  Last but not least, we offer in the associated GitHub repository https://github.com/adhalanay/epidemiology_crns a Mathematica package, Epid-CRN, which is addressed to researchers of both disciplines, and provide illustrative notebooks, which in particular solve a few minor open ME and CRN problems. Our package may also be used to study easy cases of analogue continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) ME and CRN models.</description>

      <title>The CausalBench challenge: A machine learning contest for gene network inference from single-cell perturbation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In drug discovery, mapping interactions between genes within cellular systems is a crucial early step. Such maps are not only foundational for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying disease biology but also pivotal for formulating hypotheses about potential targets for new medicines. Recognizing the need to elevate the construction of these gene-gene interaction networks, especially from large-scale, real-world datasets of perturbed single cells, the CausalBench Challenge was initiated. This challenge aimed to inspire the machine learning community to enhance state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing better utilization of expansive genetic perturbation data. Using the framework provided by the CausalBench benchmark, participants were tasked with refining the current methodologies or proposing new ones. This report provides an analysis and summary of the methods submitted during the challenge to give a partial image of the state of the art at the time of the challenge. Notably, the winning solutions significantly improved performance compared to previous baselines, establishing a new state of the art for this critical task in biology and medicine.</description>
