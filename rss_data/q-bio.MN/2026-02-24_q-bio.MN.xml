      <title>Modeling Dynamics, Cell Type Specificity, and Perturbations in Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) define the regulatory relationships among molecules such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and target genes. GRNs play a critical role in diverse biological processes, including development, disease manifestation, and evolution. However, fully characterizing these networks across multiple cell types and states remains a significant challenge. Recent advances in single-cell omics have dramatically enhanced our ability to measure biological systems at unprecedented resolution. These technologies have opened new avenues for computational methods to infer GRNs, offering deeper insights into cell type-specific mechanisms, causality, and dynamic regulatory processes. This review summarizes the current state of GRN inference from single cell omic datasets, with a particular focus on dynamics and perturbations, and outlines key open challenges that must be addressed to advance the field.</description>

      <title>Convex Analysis of Relaxation Dynamics in Chemical Reaction Networks and Generalized Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain bounds on the Kullback--Leibler divergence to equilibrium for mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs) with equilibrium. The associated decay rates are characterized in terms of the singular values of the stoichiometric matrix, convexity parameters, and time-integrated activities via deformed-exponential-type functions. We further extend these bounds within a generalized gradient flow framework. We highlight the biological relevance of this framework: the resulting bounds apply to quasi-steady-state regimes, where long transients and plateau-like behavior are common and functionally important. We illustrate the framework using a catalytic CRN exhibiting plateaus, where the bounds capture slow relaxation induced by local convexity and provide a bound-based approach to quantifying relaxation in CRNs.</description>

      <title>Exact Discrete Stochastic Simulation with Deep-Learning-Scale Gradient Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact stochastic simulation of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) is essential when discreteness and noise drive system behavior, but the hard categorical event selection in Gillespie-type algorithms blocks gradient-based learning. We eliminate this constraint by decoupling forward simulation from backward differentiation, with hard categorical sampling generating exact trajectories and gradients propagating through a continuous massively-parallel Gumbel-Softmax straight-through surrogate. Our approach enables accurate optimization at parameter scales over four orders of magnitude beyond existing simulators. We validate for accuracy, scalability, and reliability on a reversible dimerization model (0.09% error), a genetic oscillator (1.2% error), a 203,796-parameter gene regulatory network achieving 98.4% MNIST accuracy (a prototypical deep-learning multilayer perceptron benchmark), and experimental patch-clamp recordings of ion channel gating (R^2 = 0.987) in the single-channel regime. Our GPU implementation delivers 1.9 billion steps per second, matching the scale of non-differentiable simulators. By making exact stochastic simulation massively parallel and autodiff-compatible, our results enable high-dimensional parameter inference and inverse design across systems biology, chemical kinetics, physics, and related CTMC-governed domains.</description>
