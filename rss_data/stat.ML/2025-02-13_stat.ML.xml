      <title>SNAP: Sequential Non-Ancestor Pruning for Targeted Causal Effect Estimation With an Unknown Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery can be computationally demanding for large numbers of variables. If we only wish to estimate the causal effects on a small subset of target variables, we might not need to learn the causal graph for all variables, but only a small subgraph that includes the targets and their adjustment sets. In this paper, we focus on identifying causal effects between target variables in a computationally and statistically efficient way. This task combines causal discovery and effect estimation, aligning the discovery objective with the effects to be estimated. We show that definite non-ancestors of the targets are unnecessary to learn causal relations between the targets and to identify efficient adjustments sets. We sequentially identify and prune these definite non-ancestors with our Sequential Non-Ancestor Pruning (SNAP) framework, which can be used either as a preprocessing step to standard causal discovery methods, or as a standalone sound and complete causal discovery algorithm. Our results on synthetic and real data show that both approaches substantially reduce the number of independence tests and the computation time without compromising the quality of causal effect estimations.</description>

      <title>The Observational Partial Order of Causal Structures with Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two causal structures with the same set of visible variables, one is said to observationally dominate the other if the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the first contains the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the second. Knowing such dominance relations is useful for adjudicating between these structures given observational data. We here consider the problem of determining the partial order of equivalence classes of causal structures with latent variables relative to observational dominance. We provide a complete characterization of the dominance order in the case of three visible variables, and a partial characterization in the case of four visible variables. Our techniques also help to identify which observational equivalence classes have a set of realizable distributions that is characterized by nontrivial inequality constraints, analogous to Bell inequalities and instrumental inequalities. We find evidence that as one increases the number of visible variables, the equivalence classes satisfying nontrivial inequality constraints become ubiquitous. (Because such classes are the ones for which there can be a difference in the distributions that are quantumly and classically realizable, this implies that the potential for quantum-classical gaps is also ubiquitous.) Furthermore, we find evidence that constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that rely solely on conditional independence constraints have a significantly weaker distinguishing power among observational equivalence classes than algorithms that go beyond these (i.e., algorithms that also leverage nested Markov constraints and inequality constraints).</description>

      <title>Discrete Markov Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Discrete Markov Probabilistic Model (DMPM), a novel algorithm for discrete data generation. The algorithm operates in the space of bits $\{0,1\}^d$, where the noising process is a continuous-time Markov chain that can be sampled exactly via a Poissonian clock that flips labels uniformly at random. The time-reversal process, like the forward noise process, is a jump process, with its intensity governed by a discrete analogue of the classical score function. Crucially, this intensity is proven to be the conditional expectation of a function of the forward process, strengthening its theoretical alignment with score-based generative models while ensuring robustness and efficiency. We further establish convergence bounds for the algorithm under minimal assumptions and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on low-dimensional Bernoulli-distributed datasets and high-dimensional binary MNIST data. The results highlight its strong performance in generating discrete structures. This work bridges theoretical foundations and practical applications, advancing the development of effective and theoretically grounded discrete generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Likelihoods via Mutual Information: Bridging Simulation-Based Inference and Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a method to perform inference on a variety of complex scientific models with challenging inference (inverse) problems. Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) aims to efficiently use experimental resources to make better inferences. Various stochastic gradient-based BOED methods have been proposed as an alternative to Bayesian optimization and other experimental design heuristics to maximize information gain from an experiment. We demonstrate a link via mutual information bounds between SBI and stochastic gradient-based variational inference methods that permits BOED to be used in SBI applications as SBI-BOED. This link allows simultaneous optimization of experimental designs and optimization of amortized inference functions. We evaluate the pitfalls of naive design optimization using this method in a standard SBI task and demonstrate the utility of a well-chosen design distribution in BOED. We compare this approach on SBI-based models in real-world simulators in epidemiology and biology, showing notable improvements in inference.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Oriented GPLVM: Expressiveness and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-view Gaussian process latent variable model (MV-GPLVM) aims to learn a unified representation from multi-view data but is hindered by challenges such as limited kernel expressiveness and low computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we first introduce a new duality between the spectral density and the kernel function. By modeling the spectral density with a bivariate Gaussian mixture, we then derive a generic and expressive kernel termed Next-Gen Spectral Mixture (NG-SM) for MV-GPLVMs. To address the inherent computational inefficiency of the NG-SM kernel, we propose a random Fourier feature approximation. Combined with a tailored reparameterization trick, this approximation enables scalable variational inference for both the model and the unified latent representations. Numerical evaluations across a diverse range of multi-view datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in learning meaningful latent representations.</description>

      <title>Sparse Estimation of Inverse Covariance and Partial Correlation Matrices via Joint Partial Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for estimating high-dimensional sparse partial correlation and inverse covariance matrices, which exploits the connection between the inverse covariance matrix and linear regression. The method is a two-stage estimation method wherein each individual feature is regressed on all other features while positive semi-definiteness is enforced simultaneously. We provide statistical rates of convergence for the proposed method which match, and improve upon, the state-of-the-art for inverse covariance and partial correlation matrix estimation, respectively. We also propose an efficient proximal splitting algorithm for numerically computing the estimate. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity Simulation-based Inference for Computationally Expensive Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across many domains of science, stochastic models are an essential tool to understand the mechanisms underlying empirically observed data. Models can be of different levels of detail and accuracy, with models of high-fidelity (i.e., high accuracy) to the phenomena under study being often preferable. However, inferring parameters of high-fidelity models via simulation-based inference is challenging, especially when the simulator is computationally expensive. We introduce MF-NPE, a multifidelity approach to neural posterior estimation that leverages inexpensive low-fidelity simulations to infer parameters of high-fidelity simulators within a limited simulation budget. MF-NPE performs neural posterior estimation with limited high-fidelity resources by virtue of transfer learning, with the ability to prioritize individual observations using active learning. On one statistical task with analytical ground-truth and two real-world tasks, MF-NPE shows comparable performance to current approaches while requiring up to two orders of magnitude fewer high-fidelity simulations. Overall, MF-NPE opens new opportunities to perform efficient Bayesian inference on computationally expensive simulators.</description>

      <title>Concentration Inequalities for the Stochastic Optimization of Unbounded Objectives with Application to Denoising Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive novel concentration inequalities that bound the statistical error for a large class of stochastic optimization problems, focusing on the case of unbounded objective functions. Our derivations utilize the following tools: 1) A new form of McDiarmid's inequality that is based on sample dependent one component difference bounds and which leads to a novel uniform law of large numbers result for unbounded functions. 2) A Rademacher complexity bound for families of functions that satisfy an appropriate local Lipschitz property. As an application of these results, we derive statistical error bounds for denoising score matching (DSM), an application that inherently requires one to consider unbounded objective functions, even when the data distribution has bounded support. In addition, our results establish the benefit of sample reuse in algorithms that employ easily sampled auxiliary random variables in addition to the training data, e.g., as in DSM, which uses auxiliary Gaussian random variables.</description>

      <title>AdjointDEIS: Efficient Gradients for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15020v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of the latents and parameters of diffusion models with respect to some differentiable metric defined on the output of the model is a challenging and complex problem. The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the probability flow ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, naive backpropagation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel family of bespoke ODE solvers to the continuous adjoint equations for diffusion models, which we call AdjointDEIS. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the continuous adjoint equations using exponential integrators. Moreover, we provide convergence order guarantees for our bespoke solvers. Significantly, we show that continuous adjoint equations for diffusion SDEs actually simplify to a simple ODE. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AdjointDEIS for guided generation with an adversarial attack in the form of the face morphing problem. Our code will be released at https: //github.com/zblasingame/AdjointDEIS.</description>

      <title>Understanding Classifier-Free Guidance: High-Dimensional Theory and Non-Linear Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have raised concerns about the effectiveness of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), indicating that in low-dimensional settings, it can lead to overshooting the target distribution and reducing sample diversity. In this work, we demonstrate that in infinite and sufficiently high-dimensional contexts CFG effectively reproduces the target distribution, revealing a blessing-of-dimensionality result. Additionally, we explore finite-dimensional effects, precisely characterizing overshoot and variance reduction. Based on our analysis, we introduce non-linear generalizations of CFG. Through numerical simulations on Gaussian mixtures and experiments on class-conditional and text-to-image diffusion models, we validate our analysis and show that our non-linear CFG offers improved flexibility and generation quality without additional computation cost.</description>

      <title>A unifying account of warm start guarantees for patches of quantum landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barren plateaus are fundamentally a statement about quantum loss landscapes on average but there can, and generally will, exist patches of barren plateau landscapes with substantial gradients. Previous work has studied certain classes of parameterized quantum circuits and found example regions where gradients vanish at worst polynomially in system size. Here we present a general bound that unifies all these previous cases and that can tackle physically-motivated ans\"atze that could not be analyzed previously. Concretely, we analytically prove a lower-bound on the variance of the loss that can be used to show that in a non-exponentially narrow region around a point with curvature the loss variance cannot decay exponentially fast. This result is complemented by numerics and an upper-bound that suggest that any loss function with a barren plateau will have exponentially vanishing gradients in any constant radius subregion. Our work thus suggests that while there are hopes to be able to warm-start variational quantum algorithms, any initialization strategy that cannot get increasingly close to the region of attraction with increasing problem size is likely inadequate.</description>

      <title>Model-free Methods for Event History Analysis and Efficient Adjustment (PhD Thesis)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis contains a series of independent contributions to statistics, unified by a model-free perspective. The first chapter elaborates on how a model-free perspective can be used to formulate flexible methods that leverage prediction techniques from machine learning. Mathematical insights are obtained from concrete examples, and these insights are generalized to principles that permeate the rest of the thesis. The second chapter studies the concept of local independence, which describes whether the evolution of one stochastic process is directly influenced by another. To test local independence, we define a model-free parameter called the Local Covariance Measure (LCM). We formulate an estimator for the LCM, from which a test of local independence is proposed. We discuss how the size and power of the proposed test can be controlled uniformly and investigate the test in a simulation study. The third chapter focuses on covariate adjustment, a method used to estimate the effect of a treatment by accounting for observed confounding. We formulate a general framework that facilitates adjustment for any subset of covariate information. We identify the optimal covariate information for adjustment and, based on this, introduce the Debiased Outcome-adapted Propensity Estimator (DOPE) for efficient estimation of treatment effects. An instance of DOPE is implemented using neural networks, and we demonstrate its performance on simulated and real data. The fourth and final chapter introduces a model-free measure of the conditional association between an exposure and a time-to-event, which we call the Aalen Covariance Measure (ACM). We develop a model-free estimation method and show that it is doubly robust, ensuring $\sqrt{n}$-consistency provided that the nuisance functions can be estimated with modest rates. A simulation study demonstrates the use of our estimator in several settings.</description>

      <title>Filtered Markovian Projection: Dimensionality Reduction in Filtering for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the Filtered Finite State Projection (DAmbrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel method combines a particle filter with reduced variance and solving the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space, exploiting the advantages of both approaches. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Active Advantage-Aligned Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) enhances policies through direct interactions with the environment, but faces challenges related to sample efficiency. In contrast, offline RL leverages extensive pre-collected data to learn policies, but often produces suboptimal results due to limited data coverage. Recent efforts have sought to integrate offline and online RL in order to harness the advantages of both approaches. However, effectively combining online and offline RL remains challenging due to issues that include catastrophic forgetting, lack of robustness and sample efficiency. In an effort to address these challenges, we introduce A3 RL , a novel method that actively selects data from combined online and offline sources to optimize policy improvement. We provide theoretical guarantee that validates the effectiveness our active sampling strategy and conduct thorough empirical experiments showing that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art online RL techniques that utilize offline data. Our code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/xuefeng-cs/A3RL.</description>

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is a cornerstone of modern machine learning (ML), supported by advances in optimization theory that ensure efficient solutions with provable algorithmic convergence rates, which measure the speed at which optimization algorithms approach a solution, and statistical learning rates, which characterize how well the solution generalizes to unseen data. Privacy, memory, computational, and communications constraints increasingly necessitate data collection, processing, and storage across network-connected devices. In many applications, these networks operate in decentralized settings where a central server cannot be assumed, requiring decentralized ML algorithms that are both efficient and resilient. Decentralized learning, however, faces significant challenges, including an increased attack surface for adversarial interference during decentralized learning processes. This paper focuses on the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, which can cause models to deviate significantly from their intended ERM solutions. To address this challenge, we propose RESIST (Resilient dEcentralized learning using conSensus gradIent deScenT), an optimization algorithm designed to be robust against adversarially compromised communication links. RESIST achieves algorithmic and statistical convergence for strongly convex, Polyak-Lojasiewicz, and nonconvex ERM problems. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of RESIST for real-world decentralized learning in adversarial environments.</description>

      <title>What is a Sketch-and-Precondition Derivation for Low-Rank Approximation? Inverse Power Error or Inverse Power Estimation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized sketching accelerates large-scale numerical linear algebra by reducing computa- tional complexity. While the traditional sketch-and-solve approach reduces the problem size di- rectly through sketching, the sketch-and-precondition method leverages sketching to construct a computational friendly preconditioner. This preconditioner improves the convergence speed of iterative solvers applied to the original problem, maintaining accuracy in the full space. Further- more, the convergence rate of the solver improves at least linearly with the sketch size. Despite its potential, developing a sketch-and-precondition framework for randomized algorithms in low- rank matrix approximation remains an open challenge. We introduce the Error-Powered Sketched Inverse Iteration (EPSI) Method via run sketched Newton iteration for the Lagrange form as a sketch-and-precondition variant for randomized low-rank approximation. Our method achieves theoretical guarantees, including a convergence rate that improves at least linearly with the sketch size.</description>

      <title>Adaptive kernel predictors from feature-learning infinite limits of neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous influential work showed that infinite width limits of neural networks in the lazy training regime are described by kernel machines. Here, we show that neural networks trained in the rich, feature learning infinite-width regime in two different settings are also described by kernel machines, but with data-dependent kernels. For both cases, we provide explicit expressions for the kernel predictors and prescriptions to numerically calculate them. To derive the first predictor, we study the large-width limit of feature-learning Bayesian networks, showing how feature learning leads to task-relevant adaptation of layer kernels and preactivation densities. The saddle point equations governing this limit result in a min-max optimization problem that defines the kernel predictor. To derive the second predictor, we study gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay in the infinite-width limit using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The fixed point equations of the arising DMFT defines the task-adapted internal representations and the kernel predictor. We compare our kernel predictors to kernels derived from lazy regime and demonstrate that our adaptive kernels achieve lower test loss on benchmark datasets.</description>

Abstract: Training-free guided generation is a widely used and powerful technique that allows the end user to exert further control over the generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we explore the guided generation from the perspective of optimizing the solution trajectory of a neural differential equation in a greedy manner. We present such a strategy as a unifying view on training-free guidance by showing that the greedy strategy is a first-order discretization of end-to-end optimization techniques. We show that a greedy guidance strategy makes good decisions and compare it to a guidance strategy using the ideal gradients found via the continuous adjoint equations. We then show how other popular training-free guidance strategies can be viewed in a unified manner from this perspective.</description>

      <title>The Role of Randomness in Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability is a central property in learning and statistics promising the output of an algorithm $A$ does not change substantially when applied to similar datasets $S$ and $S'$. It is an elementary fact that any sufficiently stable algorithm (e.g.\ one returning the same result with high probability, satisfying privacy guarantees, etc.) must be randomized. This raises a natural question: can we quantify how much randomness is needed for algorithmic stability?
  We study the randomness complexity of two influential notions of stability in learning: replicability, which promises $A$ usually outputs the same result when run over samples from the same distribution (and shared random coins), and differential privacy, which promises the output distribution of $A$ remains similar under neighboring datasets. The randomness complexity of these notions was studied recently in (Dixon et al. ICML 2024) and (Cannone et al. ITCS 2024) for basic $d$-dimensional tasks (e.g. estimating the bias of $d$ coins), but little is known about the measures more generally or in complex settings like classification.
  Toward this end, we prove a `weak-to-strong' boosting theorem for stability: the randomness complexity of a task $M$ (either under replicability or DP) is tightly controlled by the best replication probability of any deterministic algorithm solving the task, a weak measure called `global stability' that is universally capped at $\frac{1}{2}$ (Chase et al. FOCS 2023). Using this, we characterize the randomness complexity of PAC Learning: a class has bounded randomness complexity iff it has finite Littlestone dimension, and moreover scales at worst logarithmically in the excess error of the learner. This resolves a question of (Chase et al. STOC 2024) who asked for such a characterization in the equivalent language of (error-dependent) `list-replicability'.</description>

      <title>Model Selection for Off-policy Evaluation: New Algorithms and Experimental Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holdout validation and hyperparameter tuning from data is a long-standing problem in offline reinforcement learning (RL). A standard framework is to use off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods to evaluate and select the policies, but OPE either incurs exponential variance (e.g., importance sampling) or has hyperparameters on their own (e.g., FQE and model-based). In this work we focus on hyperparameter tuning for OPE itself, which is even more under-investigated. Concretely, we select among candidate value functions ("model-free") or dynamics ("model-based") to best assess the performance of a target policy. Our contributions are two fold. We develop: (1) new model-free and model-based selectors with theoretical guarantees, and (2) a new experimental protocol for empirically evaluating them. Compared to the model-free protocol in prior works, our new protocol allows for more stable generation of candidate value functions, better control of misspecification, and evaluation of model-free and model-based methods alike. We exemplify the protocol on a Gym environment, and find that our new model-free selector, LSTD-Tournament, demonstrates promising empirical performance.</description>

      <title>PoGDiff: Product-of-Gaussians Diffusion Models for Imbalanced Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning of Linear Dynamical Systems with Transformers: Error Bounds and Depth-Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates approximation-theoretic aspects of the in-context learning capability of the transformers in representing a family of noisy linear dynamical systems. Our first theoretical result establishes an upper bound on the approximation error of multi-layer transformers with respect to an $L^2$-testing loss uniformly defined across tasks. This result demonstrates that transformers with logarithmic depth can achieve error bounds comparable with those of the least-squares estimator. In contrast, our second result establishes a non-diminishing lower bound on the approximation error for a class of single-layer linear transformers, which suggests a depth-separation phenomenon for transformers in the in-context learning of dynamical systems. Moreover, this second result uncovers a critical distinction in the approximation power of single-layer linear transformers when learning from IID versus non-IID data.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Guided Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is a popular strategy to leverage external knowledge and improve statistical efficiency, particularly with a limited target sample. We propose a novel knowledge-guided Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (KG-WDRO) framework that adaptively incorporates multiple sources of external knowledge to overcome the conservativeness of vanilla WDRO, which often results in overly pessimistic shrinkage toward zero. Our method constructs smaller Wasserstein ambiguity sets by controlling the transportation along directions informed by the source knowledge. This strategy can alleviate perturbations on the predictive projection of the covariates and protect against information loss. Theoretically, we establish the equivalence between our WDRO formulation and the knowledge-guided shrinkage estimation based on collinear similarity, ensuring tractability and geometrizing the feasible set. This also reveals a novel and general interpretation for recent shrinkage-based transfer learning approaches from the perspective of distributional robustness. In addition, our framework can adjust for scaling differences in the regression models between the source and target and accommodates general types of regularization such as lasso and ridge. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and adaptivity of KG-WDRO in enhancing small-sample transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Monge SAM: Robust Reparameterization-Invariant Sharpness-Aware Minimization Based on Loss Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on deep neural networks show that flat minima of the loss landscape correlate with improved generalization. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) efficiently finds flat regions by updating the parameters according to the gradient at an adversarial perturbation. The perturbation depends on the Euclidean metric, making SAM non-invariant under reparametrizations, which blurs sharpness and generalization. We propose Monge SAM (M-SAM), a reparametrization invariant version of SAM by considering a Riemannian metric in the parameter space induced naturally by the loss surface. Compared to previous approaches, M-SAM works under any modeling choice, relies only on mild assumptions while being as computationally efficient as SAM. We theoretically argue that M-SAM varies between SAM and gradient descent (GD), which increases robustness to hyperparameter selection and reduces attraction to suboptimal equilibria like saddle points. We demonstrate this behavior both theoretically and empirically on a multi-modal representation alignment task.</description>

      <title>On Different Notions of Redundancy in Conditional-Independence-Based Discovery of Graphical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of conditional-independence-based discovery of graphical models is to find a graph that represents the independence structure of variables in a given dataset. To learn such a representation, conditional-independence-based approaches conduct a set of statistical tests that suffices to identify the graphical representation under some assumptions on the underlying distribution of the data. In this work, we highlight that due to the conciseness of the graphical representation, there are often many tests that are not used in the construction of the graph. These redundant tests have the potential to detect or sometimes correct errors in the learned model. We show that not all tests contain this additional information and that such redundant tests have to be applied with care. Precisely, we argue that particularly those conditional (in)dependence statements are interesting that follow only from graphical assumptions but do not hold for every probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion Models Efficiency by Disentangling Total-Variance and Signal-to-Noise Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where the TV explodes exponentially, can be $\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step generation of stable molecules. A similar tendency is observed in image generation, where our approach with a uniform diffusion time grid performs comparably to the highly tailored EDM sampler.</description>

Abstract: We provide a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings reduce the risks associated with using distillation at scale; compute allocation for both the teacher and student models can now be done to maximize student performance. We provide compute optimal distillation recipes for when 1) a teacher exists, or 2) a teacher needs training. If many students are to be distilled, or a teacher already exists, distillation outperforms supervised pretraining until a compute level which grows predictably with student size. If one student is to be distilled and a teacher also needs training, supervised learning should be done instead. Additionally, we provide insights across our large scale study of distillation, which increase our understanding of distillation and inform experimental design.</description>

Abstract: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, impulse responses, human faces) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to construct one's outcome under a counterfactual treatment, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its observed factual outcome on top of the covariates. We propose a deep variational Bayesian framework that rigorously integrates two main sources of information for outcome construction under a counterfactual treatment: one source is the individual features embedded in the high-dimensional factual outcome; the other source is the response distribution of similar subjects (subjects with the same covariates) that factually received this treatment of interest.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Message Passing Graph Neural Networks with Generic Aggregation On Large Random Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11140v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of message passing graph neural networks on random graph models to their continuous counterpart as the number of nodes tends to infinity. Until now, this convergence was only known for architectures with aggregation functions in the form of normalized means, or, equivalently, of an application of classical operators like the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian. We extend such results to a large class of aggregation functions, that encompasses all classically used message passing graph neural networks, such as attention-based message passing, max convolutional message passing, (degree-normalized) convolutional message passing, or moment-based aggregation message passing. Under mild assumptions, we give non-asymptotic bounds with high probability to quantify this convergence. Our main result is based on the McDiarmid inequality. Interestingly, this result does not apply to the case where the aggregation is a coordinate-wise maximum. We treat this case separately and obtain a different convergence rate.</description>

We prove that these random neural networks are well-defined non-Gaussian processes. As a by-product, we demonstrate that these networks are solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by impulsive white noise (combinations of random Dirac measures). These processes are parameterized by the law of the weights and biases as well as the density of activation thresholds in each bounded region of the input domain. We prove that these processes are isotropic and wide-sense self-similar with Hurst exponent 3/2. We also derive a remarkably simple closed-form expression for their autocovariance function. Our results are fundamentally different from prior work in that we consider a non-asymptotic viewpoint: The number of neurons in each bounded region of the input domain (i.e., the width) is itself a random variable with a Poisson law with mean proportional to the density parameter. Finally, we show that, under suitable hypotheses, as the expected width tends to infinity, these processes can converge in law not only to Gaussian processes, but also to non-Gaussian processes depending on the law of the weights. Our asymptotic results provide a new take on several classical results (wide networks converge to Gaussian processes) as well as some new ones (wide networks can converge to non-Gaussian processes).</description>

      <title>Flat Posterior Does Matter For Bayesian Model Averaging</title>

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters and utilize posterior samples for Bayesian Model Aver- aging (BMA) in prediction. However, despite the crucial role of flatness in the loss landscape in improving the generalization of neural networks, its impact on BMA has been largely overlooked. In this work, we explore how posterior flatness influences BMA generalization and empirically demonstrate that (1) most approximate Bayesian inference methods fail to yield a flat posterior and (2) BMA predictions, without considering posterior flatness, are less effective at improving generalization. To address this, we propose Flat Posterior-aware Bayesian Model Averaging (FP-BMA), a novel training objective that explicitly encourages flat posteriors in a principled Bayesian manner. We also introduce a Flat Posterior-aware Bayesian Transfer Learning scheme that enhances generalization in downstream tasks. Empirically, we show that FP-BMA successfully captures flat posteriors, improving generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Characterization of point-source transient events with a rolling-shutter compressed sensing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point-source transient events (PSTEs) - optical events that are both extremely fast and extremely small - pose several challenges to an imaging system. Due to their speed, accurately characterizing such events often requires detectors with very high frame rates. Due to their size, accurately detecting such events requires maintaining coverage over an extended field-of-view, often through the use of imaging focal plane arrays (FPA) with a global shutter readout. Traditional imaging systems that meet these requirements are costly in terms of price, size, weight, power consumption, and data bandwidth, and there is a need for cheaper solutions with adequate temporal and spatial coverage. To address these issues, we develop a novel compressed sensing algorithm adapted to the rolling shutter readout of an imaging system. This approach enables reconstruction of a PSTE signature at the sampling rate of the rolling shutter, offering a 1-2 order of magnitude temporal speedup and a proportional reduction in data bandwidth. We present empirical results demonstrating accurate recovery of PSTEs using measurements that are spatially undersampled by a factor of 25, and our simulations show that, relative to other compressed sensing algorithms, our algorithm is both faster and yields higher quality reconstructions. We also present theoretical results characterizing our algorithm and corroborating simulations. The potential impact of our work includes the development of much faster, cheaper sensor solutions for PSTE detection and characterization.</description>

      <title>On the convergence rate of noisy Bayesian Optimization with Expected Improvement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven success in applications for decades, important open questions remain on the theoretical convergence behaviors and rates for EI. In this paper, we contribute to the convergence theory of EI in three novel and critical areas. First, we consider objective functions that fit under the Gaussian process (GP) prior assumption, whereas existing works mostly focus on functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Second, we establish for the first time the asymptotic error bound and its corresponding rate for GP-EI with noisy observations under the GP prior assumption. Third, by investigating the exploration and exploitation properties of the non-convex EI function, we establish improved error bounds of GP-EI for both the noise-free and noisy cases.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery from Conditionally Stationary Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery, i.e., inferring underlying causal relationships from observational data, is highly challenging for AI systems. In a time series modeling context, traditional causal discovery methods mainly consider constrained scenarios with fully observed variables and/or data from stationary time-series. We develop a causal discovery approach to handle a wide class of nonstationary time series that are conditionally stationary, where the nonstationary behaviour is modeled as stationarity conditioned on a set of latent state variables. Named State-Dependent Causal Inference (SDCI), our approach is able to recover the underlying causal dependencies, with provable identifiablity for the state-dependent causal structures. Empirical experiments on nonlinear particle interaction data and gene regulatory networks demonstrate SDCI's superior performance over baseline causal discovery methods. Improved results over non-causal RNNs on modeling NBA player movements demonstrate the potential of our method and motivate the use of causality-driven methods for forecasting.</description>

      <title>Predicting Cellular Responses with Variational Causal Inference and Refined Relational Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the responses of a cell under perturbations may bring important benefits to drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. In this work, we propose a novel graph variational Bayesian causal inference framework to predict a cell's gene expressions under counterfactual perturbations (perturbations that this cell did not factually receive), leveraging information representing biological knowledge in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to aid individualized cellular response predictions. Aiming at a data-adaptive GRN, we also developed an adjacency matrix updating technique for graph convolutional networks and used it to refine GRNs during pre-training, which generated more insights on gene relations and enhanced model performance. Additionally, we propose a robust estimator within our framework for the asymptotically efficient estimation of marginal perturbation effect, which is yet to be carried out in previous works. With extensive experiments, we exhibited the advantage of our approach over state-of-the-art deep learning models for individual response prediction.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for Structured Linear and Kernel Support Vector Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic programming is a ubiquitous prototype in convex programming. Many machine learning problems can be formulated as quadratic programming, including the famous Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Linear and kernel SVMs have been among the most popular models in machine learning over the past three decades, prior to the deep learning era.
  Generally, a quadratic program has an input size of $\Theta(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of variables. Assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\textsf{SETH}$), it is known that no $O(n^{2-o(1)})$ time algorithm exists when the quadratic objective matrix is positive semidefinite (Backurs, Indyk, and Schmidt, NeurIPS'17). However, problems such as SVMs usually admit much smaller input sizes: one is given $n$ data points, each of dimension $d$, and $d$ is oftentimes much smaller than $n$. Furthermore, the SVM program has only $O(1)$ equality linear constraints. This suggests that faster algorithms are feasible, provided the program exhibits certain structures.
  In this work, we design the first nearly-linear time algorithm for solving quadratic programs whenever the quadratic objective admits a low-rank factorization, and the number of linear constraints is small. Consequently, we obtain results for SVMs:
  * For linear SVM when the input data is $d$-dimensional, our algorithm runs in time $\widetilde O(nd^{(\omega+1)/2}\log(1/\epsilon))$ where $\omega\approx 2.37$ is the fast matrix multiplication exponent;
  * For Gaussian kernel SVM, when the data dimension $d = {\color{black}O(\log n)}$ and the squared dataset radius is sub-logarithmic in $n$, our algorithm runs in time $O(n^{1+o(1)}\log(1/\epsilon))$. We also prove that when the squared dataset radius is at least $\Omega(\log^2 n)$, then $\Omega(n^{2-o(1)})$ time is required. This improves upon the prior best lower bound in both the dimension $d$ and the squared dataset radius.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Algorithmic Fairness for Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches to algorithmic fairness aim to ensure equitable outcomes if human decision-makers comply perfectly with algorithmic decisions. However, perfect compliance with the algorithm is rarely a reality or even a desirable outcome in human-AI collaboration. Yet, recent studies have shown that selective compliance with fair algorithms can amplify discrimination relative to the prior human policy. As a consequence, ensuring equitable outcomes requires fundamentally different algorithmic design principles that ensure robustness to the decision-maker's (a priori unknown) compliance pattern. We define the notion of compliance-robustly fair algorithmic recommendations that are guaranteed to (weakly) improve fairness in decisions, regardless of the human's compliance pattern. We propose a simple optimization strategy to identify the best performance-improving compliance-robustly fair policy. However, we show that it may be infeasible to design algorithmic recommendations that are simultaneously fair in isolation, compliance-robustly fair, and more accurate than the human policy; thus, if our goal is to improve the equity and accuracy of human-AI collaboration, it may not be desirable to enforce traditional algorithmic fairness constraints. We illustrate the value of our approach on criminal sentencing data before and after the introduction of an algorithmic risk assessment tool in Virginia.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a versatile framework for statistical learning in non-stationary environments. In each time period, our approach applies a stability principle to select a look-back window that maximizes the utilization of historical data while keeping the cumulative bias within an acceptable range relative to the stochastic error. Our theory and numerical experiments showcase the adaptivity of this approach to unknown non-stationarity. We prove regret bounds that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors when the population losses are strongly convex, or Lipschitz only. At the heart of our analysis lie two novel components: a measure of similarity between functions and a segmentation technique for dividing the non-stationary data sequence into quasi-stationary pieces.</description>

      <title>Online Learning Quantum States with the Logarithmic Loss via VB-FTRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online learning of quantum states with the logarithmic loss (LL-OLQS) is a quantum generalization of online portfolio selection (OPS), a classic open problem in online learning for over three decades. This problem also emerges in designing stochastic optimization algorithms for maximum-likelihood quantum state tomography. Recently, Jezequel et al. (arXiv:2209.13932) proposed the VB-FTRL algorithm, the first regret-optimal algorithm for OPS with moderate computational complexity. In this paper, we generalize VB-FTRL for LL-OLQS. Let $d$ denote the dimension and $T$ the number of rounds. The generalized algorithm achieves a regret rate of $O ( d^2 \log ( d + T ) )$ for LL-OLQS. Each iteration of the algorithm consists of solving a semidefinite program that can be implemented in polynomial time by, for example, cutting-plane methods. For comparison, the best-known regret rate for LL-OLQS is currently $O ( d^2 \log T )$, achieved by an exponential weight method. However, no explicit implementation is available for the exponential weight method for LL-OLQS. To facilitate the generalization, we introduce the notion of VB-convexity. VB-convexity is a sufficient condition for the volumetric barrier associated with any function to be convex and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Calibration by Gaining Aware of Prediction Correctness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model calibration aims to align confidence with prediction correctness. The Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is widely used for calibrator training, which enforces the model to increase confidence on the ground truth class. However, we find the CE loss has intrinsic limitations. For example, for a narrow misclassification (e.g., a test sample is wrongly classified and its softmax score on the ground truth class is 0.4), a calibrator trained by the CE loss often produces high confidence on the wrongly predicted class, which is undesirable. In this paper, we propose a new post-hoc calibration objective derived from the aim of calibration. Intuitively, the proposed objective function asks that the calibrator decrease model confidence on wrongly predicted samples and increase confidence on correctly predicted samples. Because a sample itself has insufficient ability to indicate correctness, we use its transformed versions (e.g., rotated, greyscaled, and color-jittered) during calibrator training. Trained on an in-distribution validation set and tested with isolated, individual test samples, our method achieves competitive calibration performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets compared with the state of the art. Further, our analysis points out the difference between our method and commonly used objectives such as CE loss and Mean Square Error (MSE) loss, where the latters sometimes deviates from the calibration aim.</description>

      <title>Trivialized Momentum Facilitates Diffusion Generative Modeling on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generative modeling of data on manifolds is an important task, for which diffusion models in flat spaces typically need nontrivial adaptations. This article demonstrates how a technique called `trivialization' can transfer the effectiveness of diffusion models in Euclidean spaces to Lie groups. In particular, an auxiliary momentum variable was algorithmically introduced to help transport the position variable between data distribution and a fixed, easy-to-sample distribution. Normally, this would incur further difficulty for manifold data because momentum lives in a space that changes with the position. However, our trivialization technique creates a new momentum variable that stays in a simple fixed vector space. This design, together with a manifold preserving integrator, simplifies implementation and avoids inaccuracies created by approximations such as projections to tangent space and manifold, which were typically used in prior work, hence facilitating generation with high-fidelity and efficiency. The resulting method achieves state-of-the-art performance on protein and RNA torsion angle generation and sophisticated torus datasets. We also, arguably for the first time, tackle the generation of data on high-dimensional Special Orthogonal and Unitary groups, the latter essential for quantum problems.

      <title>AdapTable: Test-Time Adaptation for Tabular Data via Shift-Aware Uncertainty Calibrator and Label Distribution Handler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, tabular data often suffer from distribution shifts that threaten the performance of machine learning models. Despite its prevalence and importance, handling distribution shifts in the tabular domain remains underexplored due to the inherent challenges within the tabular data itself. In this sense, test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by adapting models to target data without accessing source data, crucial for privacy-sensitive tabular domains. However, existing TTA methods either 1) overlook the nature of tabular distribution shifts, often involving label distribution shifts, or 2) impose architectural constraints on the model, leading to a lack of applicability. To this end, we propose AdapTable, a novel TTA framework for tabular data. AdapTable operates in two stages: 1) calibrating model predictions using a shift-aware uncertainty calibrator, and 2) adjusting these predictions to match the target label distribution with a label distribution handler. We validate the effectiveness of AdapTable through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on various distribution shift scenarios. Our results demonstrate AdapTable's ability to handle various real-world distribution shifts, achieving up to a 16% improvement on the HELOC dataset.</description>

      <title>Topological Blindspots: Understanding and Extending Topological Deep Learning Through the Lens of Expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological deep learning (TDL) is a rapidly growing field that seeks to leverage topological structure in data and facilitate learning from data supported on topological objects, ranging from molecules to 3D shapes. Most TDL architectures can be unified under the framework of higher-order message-passing (HOMP), which generalizes graph message-passing to higher-order domains. In the first part of the paper, we explore HOMP's expressive power from a topological perspective, demonstrating the framework's inability to capture fundamental topological and metric invariants such as diameter, orientability, planarity, and homology. In addition, we demonstrate HOMP's limitations in fully leveraging lifting and pooling methods on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the expressivity of TDL from a \emph{topological} perspective. In the second part of the paper, we develop two new classes of architectures -- multi-cellular networks (MCN) and scalable MCN (SMCN) -- which draw inspiration from expressive GNNs. MCN can reach full expressivity, but scaling it to large data objects can be computationally expansive. Designed as a more scalable alternative, SMCN still mitigates many of HOMP's expressivity limitations. Finally, we create new benchmarks for evaluating models based on their ability to learn topological properties of complexes. We then evaluate SMCN on these benchmarks and on real-world graph datasets, demonstrating improvements over both HOMP baselines and expressive graph methods, highlighting the value of expressively leveraging topological information. Code and data are available at https://github.com/yoavgelberg/SMCN.</description>

      <title>Self-Directed Learning of Convex Labelings on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of classifying the nodes of a given graph in the self-directed learning setup. This learning setting is a variant of online learning, where rather than an adversary determining the sequence in which nodes are presented, the learner autonomously and adaptively selects them. While self-directed learning of Euclidean halfspaces, linear functions, and general multiclass hypothesis classes was recently considered, no results previously existed specifically for self-directed node classification on graphs. In this paper, we address this problem developing efficient algorithms for it. More specifically, we focus on the case of (geodesically) convex clusters, i.e., for every two nodes sharing the same label, all nodes on every shortest path between them also share the same label. In particular, we devise an algorithm with runtime polynomial in $n$ that makes only $3(h(G)+1)^4 \ln n$ mistakes on graphs with two convex clusters, where $n$ is the total number of nodes and $h(G)$ is the Hadwiger number, i.e., the size of the largest clique minor of the graph $G$. We also show that our algorithm is robust to the case that clusters are slightly non-convex, still achieving a mistake bound logarithmic in $n$. Finally, we devise a simple and efficient algorithm for homophilic clusters, where strongly connected nodes tend to belong to the same class.</description>

      <title>WAVE: Weighted Autoregressive Varying Gate for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Weighted Autoregressive Varying gatE (WAVE) attention mechanism equipped with both Autoregressive (AR) and Moving-average (MA) components. It can adapt to various attention mechanisms, enhancing and decoupling their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that WAVE attention that incorporates the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Learning of Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing acquisition of datasets over time, we now have access to precise and varied descriptions of the world, encompassing a broad range of phenomena. These datasets can be seen as observations from unknown causal generative processes, commonly described by Structural Causal Models (SCMs). Recovering SCMs from observations poses formidable challenges, and often requires us to learn a specific generative model for each dataset. In this work, we propose to learn a \emph{single} model capable of inferring the SCMs in a zero-shot manner. Rather than learning a specific SCM for each dataset, we enable the Fixed-Point Approach (FiP)~\citep{scetbon2024fip} to infer the generative SCMs conditionally on their empirical representations. As a by-product, our approach can perform zero-shot generation of new dataset samples and intervened samples. We demonstrate via experiments that our amortized procedure achieves performances on par with SoTA methods trained specifically for each dataset on both in and out-of-distribution problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SCMs are inferred in a zero-shot manner from observations, paving the way for a paradigmatic shift toward the assimilation of causal knowledge across datasets. The code is available on Github.</description>

      <title>Benign Overfitting in Single-Head Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of benign overfitting, where a trained neural network perfectly fits noisy training data but still achieves near-optimal test performance, has been extensively studied in recent years for linear models and fully-connected/convolutional networks. In this work, we study benign overfitting in a single-head softmax attention model, which is the fundamental building block of Transformers. We prove that under appropriate conditions, the model exhibits benign overfitting in a classification setting already after two steps of gradient descent. Moreover, we show conditions where a minimum-norm/maximum-margin interpolator exhibits benign overfitting. We study how the overfitting behavior depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data distribution, namely, the ratio between norms of signal and noise tokens, and prove that a sufficiently large SNR is both necessary and sufficient for benign overfitting.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Regret for Unconstrained Submodular Maximization Stochastic Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the online unconstrained submodular maximization problem (Online USM), in a setting with stochastic bandit feedback. In this framework, a decision-maker receives noisy rewards from a non monotone submodular function taking values in a known bounded interval. This paper proposes Double-Greedy - Explore-then-Commit (DG-ETC), adapting the Double-Greedy approach from the offline and online full-information settings. DG-ETC satisfies a $O(d\log(dT))$ problem-dependent upper bound for the $1/2$-approximate pseudo-regret, as well as a $O(dT^{2/3}\log(dT)^{1/3})$ problem-free one at the same time, outperforming existing approaches. In particular, we introduce a problem-dependent notion of hardness characterizing the transition between logarithmic and polynomial regime for the upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Fast Convergence of $\Phi$-Divergence Along the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm and Proximal Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of two popular discrete-time Markov chains in continuous space, the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm and the Proximal Sampler, which are discretizations of the Langevin dynamics. We extend mixing time analyses for these Markov chains to hold in $\Phi$-divergence. We show that any $\Phi$-divergence arising from a twice-differentiable strictly convex function $\Phi$ converges to $0$ exponentially fast along these Markov chains, under the assumption that their stationary distributions satisfy the corresponding $\Phi$-Sobolev inequality, which holds for example when the target distribution of the Langevin dynamics is strongly log-concave. Our setting includes as special cases popular mixing time regimes, namely the mixing in chi-squared divergence under a Poincar\'e inequality, and the mixing in relative entropy under a log-Sobolev inequality. Our results follow by viewing the sampling algorithms as noisy channels and bounding the contraction coefficients arising in the appropriate strong data processing inequalities.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Generative Modeling with Variational Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating an individual's counterfactual outcomes under interventions is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in the observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage disentangled exogenous noise abduction that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Pipeline for Machine Learning with Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have shown success in applications with an objective of prediction, but the algorithmic complexity of some models makes them difficult to interpret. Methods have been proposed to provide insight into these "black-box" models, but there is little research that focuses on supervised ML when the model inputs are functional data. In this work, we consider two applications from high-consequence spaces with objectives of making predictions using functional data inputs. One application aims to classify material types to identify explosive materials given hyperspectral computed tomography scans of the materials. The other application considers the forensics science task of connecting an inkjet printed document to the source printer using color signatures extracted by Raman spectroscopy. An instinctive route to consider for analyzing these data is a data driven ML model for classification, but due to the high consequence nature of the applications, we argue it is important to appropriately account for the nature of the data in the analysis to not obscure or misrepresent patterns. As such, we propose the Variable importance Explainable Elastic Shape Analysis (VEESA) pipeline for training ML models with functional data that (1) accounts for the vertical and horizontal variability in the functional data and (2) provides an explanation in the original data space of how the model uses variability in the functional data for prediction. The pipeline makes use of elastic functional principal components analysis (efPCA) to generate uncorrelated model inputs and permutation feature importance (PFI) to identify the principal components important for prediction. The variability captured by the important principal components in visualized the original data space. We ultimately discuss ideas for natural extensions of the VEESA pipeline and challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>Wrapped Gaussian on the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular and non-flat data distributions are prevalent across diverse domains of data science, yet their specific geometric structures often remain underutilized in machine learning frameworks. A principled approach to accounting for the underlying geometry of such data is pivotal, particularly when extending statistical models, like the pervasive Gaussian distribution. In this work, we tackle those issue by focusing on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, a key focus in information geometry. We introduced a non-isotropic wrapped Gaussian by leveraging the exponential map, we derive theoretical properties of this distribution and propose a maximum likelihood framework for parameter estimation. Furthermore, we reinterpret established classifiers on SPD through a probabilistic lens and introduce new classifiers based on the wrapped Gaussian model. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of this geometry-aware distribution, underscoring its potential to advance manifold-based data analysis. This work lays the groundwork for extending classical machine learning and statistical methods to more complex and structured data.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning via Information Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we effectively remove or "unlearn" undesirable information, such as specific features or individual data points, from a learning outcome while minimizing utility loss and ensuring rigorous guarantees? We introduce a mathematical framework based on information-theoretic regularization to address both feature and data point unlearning. For feature unlearning, we derive a unified solution that simultaneously optimizes diverse learning objectives, including entropy, conditional entropy, KL-divergence, and the energy of conditional probability. For data point unlearning, we first propose a novel definition that serves as a practical condition for unlearning via retraining, is easy to verify, and aligns with the principles of differential privacy from an inference perspective. Then, we provide provable guarantees for our framework on data point unlearning. By combining flexibility in learning objectives with simplicity in regularization design, our approach is highly adaptable and practical for a wide range of machine learning and AI applications.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.</description>

      <title>On the query complexity of sampling from non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a $d$-dimensional distribution with density $p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$, which does not necessarily satisfy good isoperimetric conditions.
  Specifically, we show that for any $L,M$ satisfying $LM\ge d\ge 5$, $\epsilon\in \left(0,\frac{1}{32}\right)$, and any algorithm with query accesses to the value of $f(x)$ and $\nabla f(x)$, there exists an $L$-log-smooth distribution with second moment at most $M$ such that the algorithm requires $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ queries to compute a sample whose distribution is within $\epsilon$ in total variation distance to the target distribution. We complement the lower bound with an algorithm requiring $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\mathcal O(d)}$ queries, thereby characterizing the tight (up to the constant in the exponent) query complexity for sampling from the family of non-log-concave distributions.
  Our results are in sharp contrast with the recent work of Huang et al. (COLT'24), where an algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity was proposed for sampling from a non-log-concave distribution when $M=\mathtt{poly}(d)$. Their algorithm works under the stronger condition that all distributions along the trajectory of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, starting from the target distribution, are $\mathcal O(1)$-log-smooth. We investigate this condition and prove that it is strictly stronger than requiring the target distribution to be $\mathcal O(1)$-log-smooth. Additionally, we study this condition in the context of mixtures of Gaussians.
  Finally, we place our results within the broader theme of ``sampling versus optimization'', as studied in Ma et al. (PNAS'19). We show that for a wide range of parameters, sampling is strictly easier than optimization by a super-exponential factor in the dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures : Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>
