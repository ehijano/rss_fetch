      <title>Solitons in the Korteweg-de Vries Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical solution to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation using a Crank-Nicolson scheme, and compare its performance to the Fast Fourier Transform method. The properties and interactions of soliton solutions are further examined. Initial conditions were varied to analyse soliton formation in the resulting system. Performing an L$^2$ error analysis demonstrated consistency between numerical methods of solving the KdV equation and analytical solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this lecture, we survey a number of recent results and developments regarding the representation theory of infinite-dimensional quantum groups (quantum affine algebras and related algebras), as well as their connections with cluster categorification and quantum integrable models. We will also give new examples and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov system and trigonometric Yang-Baxter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to obtain a complete characterization of soliton and breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov (IDM) system, a vector generalization of the Ablowitz-Ladik model. The IDM system, which in the continuous limit reduces to the Manakov system (i.e., a 2-component vector nonlinear Schrodinger equation), was shown to admit a variety of discrete vector soliton solutions: fundamental solitons, fundamental breathers, and composite breathers. While the interaction of fundamental solitons was studied early on, no results are presently available for other types of soliton-breather and breather-breather interactions. Our study reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental breather. Conversely, the interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental breathers with polarization shifts, but may also result in a fundamental soliton and a fundamental breather. Composite breathers interact trivially both with each other and with a fundamental soliton or breather. Explicit formulas for the scattering coefficients that characterize fundamental and composite breathers are given. This allows us to interpret the interactions in terms of a refactorization problem and derive the associated Yang-Baxter maps describing the effect of interactions on the polarizations. These give the first examples of parametric Yang-Baxter maps of trigonometric type.</description>

      <title>Reflection Maps Associated with Involutions and Factorization Problems, and Their Poisson Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the set-theoretic solutions of the reflection equation, also known as reflection maps, is closely related to that of the Yang-Baxter maps. In this work, we construct reflection maps on various geometrical objects, associated with factorization problems on rational loop groups and involutions. We show that such reflection maps are smoothly conjugate to the composite of permutation maps, with corresponding reduced Yang-Baxter maps. In the case when the reduced Yang-Baxter maps are independent of parameters, the latter are just braiding operators. We also study the symplectic and Poisson geometry of such reflection maps. In a special case, the factorization problems are associated with the collision of N-solitons of the n-Manakov system with a boundary, and in this context the N-body polarization reflection map is a symplectomorphism.</description>

      <title>Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with integer parameter $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $\theta \geq 2$ at $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory by Its, Kuijlaars and \"{O}stensson, which is the $\theta = 1$ special case of our MB ensemble. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. In the analysis of the RH problems, we construct matrix-valued model RH problems of size $(\theta + 1) \times (\theta + 1)$, and prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma. The new limiting correlation kernels are proved to be universal for a large class of potential functions, and they interpolate the Meijer G-kernels for the hard edge regime and the Airy kernel for the soft edge regime. We observe that the new limiting correlation kernels have the integrability that is not seen in previous studies in random matrix theory and determinantal point processes. In the $\theta = 2$ case, we give a detailed analysis of the Lax pair associated with the model RH problem, show that it results in the Chazy I equation, which has a Painlev\'{e} IV reduction, and find that the Lax pair is in the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies.</description>
