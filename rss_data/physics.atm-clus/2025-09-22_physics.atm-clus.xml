      <title>Active Learning for Machine Learning Driven Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learned coarse grained (CG) potentials are fast, but degrade over time when simulations reach undersampled biomolecular conformations, and generating widespread all atom (AA) data to combat this is computationally infeasible. We propose a novel active learning framework for CG neural network potentials in molecular dynamics (MD). Building on the CGSchNet model, our method employs root mean squared deviation (RMSD) based frame selection from MD simulations in order to generate data on the fly by querying an oracle during the training of a neural network potential. This framework preserves CG level efficiency while correcting the model at precise, RMSD identified coverage gaps. By training CGSchNet, a coarse grained neural network potential, we empirically show that our framework explores previously unseen configurations and trains the model on unexplored regions of conformational space. Our active learning framework enables a CGSchNet model trained on the Chignolin protein to achieve a 33.05% improvement in the Wasserstein 1 (W1) metric in Time lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) space on an in house benchmark suite.</description>

      <title>A fast and streamlined method for the measurement of absolute photodetachment and photodissociation cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absolute photodetachment cross-section characterizes the photostability of atomic and molecular anions against photodestruction by neutralization. The measurement of this quantity has been reported only for atomic and simple molecular ions. In 2006, Wester's group introduced a novel ion-trap-based technique to measure the absolute photodetachment cross-section [S. Trippel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 193003 (2006)] of OH^-. In the present work, we propose a novel methodology to streamline this technique to reduce the measurement time by several orders of magnitude by combining a single experimental rate measurement with a simulated column density distribution of the trapped ions. We validated our approach by reproducing the cross-section reported for OH^- at 632.8 nm. Using this technique, we report the first such measurement for a molecule of biological interest, deprotonated indole, at a laser wavelength of 403 nm. The proposed scheme is anticipated to have a significant and transformative impact on the development of a comprehensive database for photodetachment and photodissociation cross-sections of molecular ions. Furthermore, these measurements have the potential to drive the development of cutting-edge computational codes for cross-section calculations, enabling an unprecedentedly detailed understanding of electron dynamics in large molecules and the light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</description>
