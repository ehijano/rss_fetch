      <title>Cost-Effective Community-Hierarchy-Based Mutual Voting Approach for Influence Maximization in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various types of promising techniques have come into being for influence maximization whose aim is to identify influential nodes in complex networks. In essence, real-world applications usually have high requirements on the balance between time complexity and accuracy of influential nodes identification. To address the challenges of imperfect node influence measurement and inefficient seed nodes selection mechanism in such class of foregoing techniques, this article proposes a novel approach called Cost-Effective Community-Hierarchy-Based Mutual Voting for influence maximization in complex networks. First, we develop a method for measuring the importance of different nodes in networks based on an original concept of Dual-Scale Community-Hierarchy Information that synthesizes both hierarchy structural information and community structural information of nodes. The community structural information contained in the nodes is measured by a new notion of Hierarchical-Community Entropy. Second, we develop a method named Cost-Effective Mutual-Influence-based Voting for seed nodes selection. Hereinto, a low-computational-cost mutual voting mechanism and an updating strategy called Lazy Score Updating Strategy are newly constructed for optimizing the selecting of seed nodes. Third, we develop a balance index to evaluate the performance of different methods in striking the tradeoff between time complexity and the accuracy of influential nodes identification. Finally, we demonstrate the approach performance over ten public datasets. The extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms 16 state-of-the-art techniques on the balance between time complexity and accuracy of influential nodes identification. Compared with the method with the second highest value of the balance index, our approach can be improved by at most 9.29%.</description>

      <title>Digital Advertising in a Post-Cookie World: Charting the Impact of Google's Topics API</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating Google's Topics API into the digital advertising ecosystem represents a significant shift toward privacy-conscious advertising practices. This article analyses the implications of implementing Topics API on ad networks, focusing on competition dynamics and ad space accessibility. Through simulations based on extensive datasets capturing user behavior and market share data for ad networks, we evaluate metrics such as Ad Placement Eligibility, Low Competition Rate, and solo competitor. The findings reveal a noticeable impact on ad networks, with larger players strengthening their dominance and smaller networks facing challenges securing ad spaces and competing effectively. Moreover, the study explores the potential environmental implications of Google's actions, highlighting the need to carefully consider policy and regulatory measures to ensure fair competition and privacy protection. Overall, this research contributes valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of digital advertising and highlights the importance of balancing privacy with competition and innovation in the online advertising landscape.</description>

      <title>MAS4POI: a Multi-Agents Collaboration System for Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have potential benefits of complex decision-making tasks management across various domains but their applications in the next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation remain underexplored. This paper proposes a novel MAS4POI system designed to enhance next POI recommendations through multi-agent interactions. MAS4POI supports Large Language Models (LLMs) specializing in distinct agents such as DataAgent, Manager, Analyst, and Navigator with each contributes to a collaborative process of generating the next POI recommendations.The system is examined by integrating six distinct LLMs and evaluated by two real-world datasets for recommendation accuracy improvement in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yuqian2003/MAS4POI.</description>

      <title>AggregHate: An Efficient Aggregative Approach for the Detection of Hatemongers on Social Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances, we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging. In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user activity, and the user network. We evaluate our methods on three unique datasets X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler showing that a processing a user's texts in her social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared to previously used text and graph-based methods. Our method can be then used to improve the classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as well as inform intervention measures. Moreover, our approach is highly efficient even for very large datasets and networks.</description>

      <title>DarkGram: Exploring and Mitigating Cybercriminal content shared in Telegram channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first large scale analysis of 339 cybercriminal activity channels (CACs) on Telegram from February to May 2024. Collectively followed by over 23.8 million users, these channels shared a wide array of illicit content, including compromised credentials, pirated software and media, tools for blackhat hacking resources such as malware, social engineering scams, and exploit kits. We developed DarkGram, a BERT based framework that identifies malicious posts from the CACs with an accuracy of 96%, using which we conducted a quantitative analysis of 53,605 posts from these channels, revealing key characteristics of shared content. While much of this content is distributed for free, channel administrators frequently employ promotions and giveaways to engage users and boost the sales of premium cybercriminal content. These channels also pose significant risks to their own subscribers. Notably, 28.1% of shared links contained phishing attacks, and 38% of executable files were bundled with malware. Moreover, our qualitative analysis of replies in CACs shows how subscribers cultivate a dangerous sense of community through requests for illegal content, illicit knowledge sharing, and collaborative hacking efforts, while their reactions to posts, including emoji responses, further underscore their appreciation for such content. We also find that the CACs can evade scrutiny by quickly migrating to new channels with minimal subscriber loss, highlighting the resilience of this ecosystem. To counteract this, we further utilized DarkGram to detect new channels, reporting malicious content to Telegram and the affected organizations which resulted in the takedown of 196 such channels over three months. To aid further collaborative efforts in taking down these channels, we open source our dataset and the DarkGram framework.</description>

      <title>Image memorability enhances social media virality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain social media contents can achieve widespread virality. Prior research has identified that emotion and morality may play a role in this phenomenon. Yet, due to the variability in subjective perception of these factors, they may not consistently predict virality. Recent work in vision and memory has identified a property intrinsic to images - memorability - that can automatically drive human memory. Here, we present evidence that memorability can enhance social media virality by analyzing a naturalistic dataset from Reddit, a widely used social media platform. Specifically, we discover that more memorable images (as judged automatically by neural network ResMem) cause more comments and higher upvotes, and this effect replicates across three different timepoints. To uncover the mechanism of this effect, we employ natural language processing techniques finding that memorable images tend to evoke abstract and less emotional comments. Leveraging an object recognition neural network, we discover that memorable images result in comments directed to information external to the image, which causes them to be more abstract. Further analysis quantifying the representations within the ResMem neural network reveals that images with more semantically distinct features are more likely to be memorable, and consequently, more likely to go viral. These findings reveal that images that are easier to remember become more viral, offering new future directions such as the creation of predictive models of content virality or the application of these insights to enhance the design of impactful visual content.</description>

      <title>Critical Node Detection in Temporal Social Networks, Based on Global and Semi-local Centrality Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nodes that play strategic roles in networks are called critical or influential nodes. For example, in an epidemic, we can control the infection spread by isolating critical nodes; in marketing, we can use certain nodes as the initial spreaders aiming to reach the largest part of the network, or they can be selected for removal in targeted attacks to maximise the fragmentation of the network. In this study, we focus on critical node detection in temporal networks. We propose three new measures to identify the critical nodes in temporal networks: the temporal supracycle ratio, temporal semi-local integration, and temporal semi-local centrality. We analyse the performance of these measures based on their effect on the SIR epidemic model in three scenarios: isolating the influential nodes when an epidemic happens, using the influential nodes as seeds of the epidemic, or removing them to analyse the robustness of the network. We compare the results with existing centrality measures, particularly temporal betweenness, temporal centrality, and temporal degree deviation. The results show that the introduced measures help identify influential nodes more accurately. The proposed methods can be used to detect nodes that need to be isolated to reduce the spread of an epidemic or as initial nodes to speedup dissemination of information.</description>

      <title>Bounded-confidence opinion models with random-time interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In models of opinion dynamics, the opinions of individual agents evolve with time. One type of opinion model is a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents compromise their opinions with each other if those opinions are sufficiently similar. In studies of BCMs, it is typically assumed that interactions between agents occur at deterministic times. This assumption neglects an inherent element of randomness in social systems. In this paper, we study BCMs on networks and allow agents to interact at random times. To incorporate random-time interactions, we use renewal processes to determine social interactions, which can follow arbitrary waiting-time distributions (WTDs). We establish connections between these random-time-interaction BCMs and deterministic-time-interaction BCMs. We find that BCMs with Markovian WTDs have consistent statistical properties on different networks but that the statistical properties of BCMs with non-Markovian WTDs depend on network structure.</description>

      <title>MeSH Concept Relevance and Knowledge Evolution: A Data-driven Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), one of the main knowledge organization systems in the biomedical domain, constantly evolves following the latest scientific discoveries in health and life sciences. Previous research focused on quantifying information in MeSH using its hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach based on information theory and network analyses to quantify the evolution in MeSH and the relevance of its concepts. Our approach leverages article annotations and their citation networks to compute informativeness, usefulness, disruptiveness, and influence of MeSH concepts over time. The citation network includes the instances of MeSH concepts, and the concept relevance is calculated individually. We evaluated our approach using changes in the terminology and showed that it effectively captures its evolution. At the first level of the hierarchy, the most relevant concept trend decreased (Chemical and Drugs concept, trend-slope = $-9.72E-08$, $p-value &lt; 0.01$). At the second level, the most relevant concept trend increased (Neoplasms concept, trend-slope = $5.52E-06$, $p-value &lt; 0.01$). Moreover, we validated the ability of our framework to characterize retracted articles and showed that concepts used to annotate retracted articles differ substantially from those used to annotate non-retracted ones. The mean relevance of evolving concepts is higher for concepts that remained unchanged (2.09E-03 vs. 8.46E-04), and the mean relevance of retracted papers is higher for concepts that were annotated in non-retracted papers (0.17 vs. 0.15). The proposed framework provides an effective method to rank concept relevance and can be useful in maintaining evolving knowledge organization systems.</description>

      <title>ALAAMEE: Open-source software for fitting autologistic actor attribute models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The autologistic actor attribute model (ALAAM) is a model for social influence, derived from the more widely known exponential-family random graph model (ERGM). ALAAMs can be used to estimate parameters corresponding to multiple forms of social contagion associated with network structure and actor covariates. This work introduces ALAAMEE, open-source Python software for estimation, simulation, and goodness-of-fit testing for ALAAM models. ALAAMEE implements both the stochastic approximation and equilibrium expectation (EE) algorithms for ALAAM parameter estimation, including estimation from snowball sampled network data. It implements data structures and statistics for undirected, directed, and bipartite networks. We use a simulation study to assess the accuracy of the EE algorithm for ALAAM parameter estimation and statistical inference, and demonstrate the use of ALAAMEE with empirical examples using both small (fewer than 100 nodes) and large (more than 10 000 nodes) networks.</description>

      <title>GNNAnatomy: Systematic Generation and Evaluation of Multi-Level Explanations for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in machine learning tasks involving graphs, such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. However, explaining their decision-making process is challenging due to the complex transformations GNNs perform by aggregating relational information from graph topology. Existing methods for explaining GNNs face key limitations: (1) lack of flexibility in generating explanations at varying levels, (2) difficulty in identifying unique substructures relevant to class differentiation, and (3) little support to ensure the trustworthiness of explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce GNNAnatomy, a visual analytics system designed to generate and evaluate multi-level GNN explanations for graph classification tasks. GNNAnatomy uses graphlets, primitive graph substructures, to identify the most critical substructures in a graph class by analyzing the correlation between GNN predictions and graphlet frequencies. These correlations are presented interactively for user-selected group of graphs through our visual analytics system. To further validate top-ranked graphlets, we measure the change in classification confidence after removing each graphlet from the original graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNAnatomy through case studies on synthetic and real-world graph datasets from sociology and biology domains. Additionally, we compare GNNAnatomy with state-of-the-art explainable GNN methods to showcase its utility and versatility.</description>
