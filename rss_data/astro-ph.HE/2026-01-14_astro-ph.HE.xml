      <title>Relativistic jets from millisecond proto-magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07918v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</description>

      <title>Dense gas linked to star-forming regions photoionised by embedded gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1-100 pc region embedding long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) has been hitherto unexplored, as extremely high ionisation by the GRB prevents application of optical absorption spectroscopy on such distances. We show that the GRB ionising flux imprints a unique time- and spatially-dependent ionisation structure on the gas, that can be probed by X-ray absorption. Application of this model to a selected sample of 7 bright GRB X-ray afterglow spectra observed by \textit{XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn enables an independent, quantitative estimation of the density (log(n) $\sim$ 2-4) and distances (5-100 pc) of the ionized absorber directly from the GRB X-ray spectrum, thereby allowing us to locate the absorbing medium of this representative sample of long GRBs in the region of the density-size diagram populated by star-forming regions versus other gravitationally bound objects in the Universe.</description>

      <title>The GRB Intrinsic Duration Distribution: Progenitor Insights Across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the distribution of the intrinsic duration of gamma-ray bursts' prompt emission. This expands upon the analysis of Bromberg et al., 2012 and Bromberg et al. 2013 who showed evidence for collapsar progenitors based on the presence of a plateau in the distribution of $T_{90}$, the duration over which 90 % of the prompt emission is observed for any given detector. We confirm the presence of this plateau in the distribution of duration corrected for cosmological time dilation (what we call intrinsic duration, $T_{int}$), but shifted to smaller timescales by a factor of $1/(1+z_{\rm av}) \sim 1/3$, where $z_{\rm av}$ is the average GRB redshift. More significantly, we show this plateau is only present in the sample of GRBs with redshifts greater than $(1+z) \sim 2$, and does not appear in the duration distribution of lower redshift GRBs. This result aligns with suggestions that the low redshift population of GRBs has a significant contribution from non-collapsar progenitors (while the high redshift sample is dominated by collapsars). We also show the difference in this distribution between spectrally hard and soft GRBs, confirming that a plateau is only present for the soft subset of GRBs. However, when we separate the soft GRBs into low and high redshift subsets, we find that only the high redshift soft GRBs show evidence of a plateau, while the low-redshift soft GRBs do not. This suggests there exists a significant subset of spectrally soft non-collapsar progenitors at low redshift. Finally, we use the end time of the plateau to constrain the GRB progenitor density profile and radius, and show the maximum size of a collapsar is a few tenths of a solar radius.</description>

      <title>Identification of three new ULXs in NGC 4631 and NGC 1097: evidence for stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of galaxies continue to reveal new ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), increasing their known population and improving the statistics needed to understand their nature. We study the ULX populations of NGC 4631 and NGC 1097 using archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT observations to identify new ULXs and investigate their X-ray and optical properties. We analyzed X-ray data spanning 2000-2025. Spectral fitting was performed for sources with sufficient counts using absorbed power-law and diskbb models. Variability analyses, including hardness-intensity diagrams and light curves, were used to assess short- and long-term variability. Optical color-magnitude diagrams and near-infrared (NIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were employed to identify possible donor stars. In NGC 4631, we identified two new transient ULXs, X-6 and X-7, with X-ray count rates varying by more than an order of magnitude. The LX-T^4 relation from diskbb fits provides strong evidence that NGC 4631 X-6 is powered by a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a standard disk. The optical sources within the X-ray error circles of X-6 and X-7 are candidate counterparts, suggesting these systems are candidate HMXBs. In NGC 1097, we discovered a new transient ULX, ULX-3, showing X-ray luminosity variations by a factor of about 30 and evidence for spectral state transitions, consistent with either a stellar-mass black hole or a neutron star. We identified a unique optical and NIR counterpart. While the optical emission is variable, the NIR emission is stable. The NIR SED is consistent with a blackbody temperature of about 3300 K, compatible with a red supergiant donor with a radius of about 200 solar radii.</description>

      <title>Cascade Processes of Strong and Weak MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the framework of relativistic force-free magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we explore the fundamental properties of strong and weak turbulent cascades using high-resolution numerical simulations in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field. We find that (1) power spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies both for the strong and weak turbulence resemble those observed in the non-relativistic MHD turbulence; (2) intermittency of magnetic fields in strong turbulence is stronger than that in the weak one; (3) generated Alfv\'en modes show similar energy spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies to those of non-relativistic case; (4) generated fast modes present a power spectrum similar to that of Alfv\'en modes, with a strong (for strong turbulence) or weak (for weak turbulence) scale-dependent anisotropy, which are significantly different from non-relativistic turbulence; and (5) applications of our numerical results to neutron star magnetospheres show that the strong (or moderately weak) turbulent cascade can explain the X-ray radiation of the Vela pulsar. Our study is of great significance for understanding energy transfer, magnetic field evolution, and particle acceleration mechanisms in extreme astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Forbush decrease on 2024 May 10, using the ALPAQUITA air-shower array at the 70-1000 GV rigidity range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray and Astronomy (ALPACA) is a new air-shower array experiment under construction in the Bolivian Andes, and its prototype ALPAQUITA surface array has been operating since 2023 April. In addition to the traditional $\ge$3-hit or $\ge$4-hit coincidences to trigger recording air-shower events, ALPAQUITA records the counting rates of the $\ge$1-hit and $\ge$2-hit events (Any1 and Any2, respectively). We report a successful detection of a Forbush decrease occurred on 2024 May 10 caused by a passage of an interplanetary shock formed ahead of the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection. The amplitude detected in the Any1 rate is 4.26$\pm$0.33% at the median primary rigidity of 76GV which is consistent with the observations with the worldwide neutron monitor and muon detector networks. Under the assumption of a power-law rigidity spectrum, we renormalized the errors of the observed amplitude ($A_{obs}$) and fitted them as a function of the median primary rigidity ($R_{m}$) of each detector and observational method. The result $A_{obs} = (10.9\% \pm 0.9\%) \times (R_{m}/10\,GV)^{-0.55 \pm 0.07}$ exhibits a hard nature of this event. Our non-detection in the Any2 rate decrease constrains the amplitude with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit to be 0.95% at 960GV. This marginally suggests an existence of a spectral softening between 100GV and 1000GV as also suggested by the Misato underground muon detector at 145GV. Although a strong geomagnetic storm was observed during this period, we conclude it does not impact our results. Our novel technique realizes a unique coverage to study the behavior of the Forbush decreases at the highest rigidity.</description>

      <title>Bifurcated Impact of Neutrino Fast Flavor Conversion on Core-collapse Supernovae Informed by Multi-angle Neutrino Radiation Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this {\it Letter}, we present a compelling and robust argument for the roles of neutrino fast flavor conversion (FFC) in the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), combining the {\it multi-angle} FFC subgrid model rooted in quantum kinetic theory with the multi-dimensional four-species Boltzmann neutrino radiation hydrodynamics. Employing various progenitor masses and the nuclear equations of states, we find that the effect of FFC on CCSN explosion is bifurcated depending on the progenitors. For the lowest-mass progenitor, FFC facilitates the shock revival and enhances the explosion energy, whereas for higher-mass progenitors its impact is inhibitory. We identify the mass accretion rate as the key determinant governing this bifurcation. When the mass accretion rate is low (high), the contribution of FFC to neutrino heating becomes positive (negative), because the heating efficiency enhancement via FFC-driven spectral hardening of electron-type neutrinos dominates over (is outweighed by) the concurrent reduction in neutrino luminosity. Our results further highlight the limitations of approximate neutrino transport, and demonstrate that a multi-angle treatment is essential for accurately capturing FFC effects; otherwise, FFCs are missed and even generated spuriously.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Binary Black Hole Merger Events Associated with Active Galactic Nucleus Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation channels of binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) network remain uncertain. While BBH mergers occurring inside active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks may interact with surrounding gas and generate observable optical flares. We test this scenario by quantifying the spatial and temporal correlation between BBH events in GWTC-4.0 and AGN flares identified from six years of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR23 data. Using 80 BBH mergers selected for adequate localization, redshift reach, observing-epoch overlap, and ZTF sky coverage, we construct a likelihood for the flare-associated fraction, $f_{\rm flare}$, that combines each event's 3D localization with a locally estimated flare number density derived from a 3D Voronoi tessellation, while explicitly accounting for survey boundaries and incomplete catalog coverage. Adopting a 200-day post-merger time window for potential counterparts, we infer $f_{\rm flare} = 0.07_{-0.05}^{+0.25}$ (90\% confidence level). This non-zero maximum-likelihood value is driven primarily by GW190412, for which a single flare candidate (J143041.67+355703.8) is consistent in both time and spatial position. Excluding GW190412 yields results consistent with no association and an upper limit of $f_{\rm flare} &lt; 0.17$ at 90\% confidence level. The intrinsic properties of GW190412 and the characteristics of the candidate host AGN are broadly consistent with theoretical expectations for the AGN-disk formation channel, motivating continued, targeted electromagnetic follow-up of well-localized and highly asymmetric BBH mergers in current and upcoming time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Not so Swift: 20 years of multiwavelength observations of Mrk 421 and Mrk 501</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The blazars Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 have shown multiwavelength variability on all observed timescales, and have been well studied at high energies on short timescales. We aim to characterise the long-term temporal behaviour of these blazars at synchrotron energies, namely optical, UV, and X-ray, in order to assess current models of these objects and their processes. Methods. Amongst the longest light curves ever studied for these sources, we investigated 20 years of data (2005-2025) from the Swift-UVOT and Swift-XRT telescopes. We examined spectral models, fractional variabilities, flux distributions, and X-ray photon index vs flux relations, as well as carrying out in-depth time series analysis using structure functions, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and discrete correlation functions. Results. Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 both showed intriguing variability in all studied wavelengths; this variability has been found to be energy dependent, as has the trend of lognormality in flux distributions. X-ray photon indices fluctuated greatly throughout the entire period, showing an overall harder-when-brighter trend. Hints of a quasi-periodicity have been found in the X-ray of Mrk 501 (host frame time scale $\sim390$ days, &gt;3$\sigma$) but not in the UV or X-ray of Mrk 421, or in the UV of Mrk 501. No correlation at any time lag was found between the optical/UV and X-ray bands in either source.</description>

      <title>Radio timing constraints on the orbital orientation and component masses of PSR J1455$-$3330</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J1455$-$3330 is a $\sim$7.98 ms pulsar in a $\sim$76.17 day nearly circular orbit with a white dwarf companion. In this work, we combine the available Lovell, Nan\c{c}ay decimetric Radio Telescope, Green Bank, and MeerKAT pulsar timing data spanning $\sim$ 30 years to measure the kinematic and relativistic effects of PSR J1455$-$3330 to constrain its 3D orbital geometry and component masses. We detect a relativistic Shapiro delay signal. We measure a significant orthometric amplitude $h_3 = 0.307^{+0.022}_{-0.026}$ $\mu$s and an orthometric ratio $\varsigma = 0.551^{+0.057}_{-0.054}$. We measure the change in projected semi-major axis $\dot{x} = -202.1^{+2.5}_{-2.7} \times10^{-16} \, \rm s\,s^{-1}$ with high significance, parallax, $\varpi$ = 1.11(6) mas, parallax derived distance 0.90(5) kpc, and a precise total proper motion magnitude of 12.432(2) mas yr$^{-1}$. A self-consistent analysis of all kinematic and relativistic effects, assuming general relativity, yields two solutions: (1) a pulsar mass $M_{\rm p} = 1.39^{+0.38}_{-0.18}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, a companion mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.293^{+0.056}_{-0.026}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$, an orbital inclination, $i = 63(2)^{\circ}$, and longitude of the ascending node, $\Omega = 212(12)^{\circ}$ or (2) a pulsar mass $M_{\rm p} = 1.53^{+1.10}_{-0.22} \, \rm M_{\odot}$, a companion mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.309^{+0.163}_{-0.026}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, an orbital inclination, $i = 123(4)^{\circ}$, and longitude of the ascending node, $\Omega = 334(12)^{\circ}$. All uncertainties represent the 68.27$\%$ credibility region. These results strongly favour a helium-dominated white dwarf companion.</description>

      <title>Evolution and afterglow emission of gamma-ray burst jets from binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets launched in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are widely accepted as the engines powering most of the population of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding their structure and dynamics-particularly during and after breakout from the merger ejecta-is crucial for interpreting GRB afterglows, especially for off-axis observers. Traditional models often assume simple angular or radial jet profiles, potentially missing key features emerging for jets piercing through realistic environments. This work aims to investigate the formation and evolution of the jet structure as it propagates through a non-homogeneous, anisotropic BNS merger environment. We focus on how the interaction with the ambient medium shapes the jet's angular and velocity distributions and assess the impact of this realistic structure on the resulting afterglow light curves. We perform a series of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets launched in post-merger environments, exploring different injection conditions. Simulations are evolved to late times, approaching the ballistic regime, where further dynamical evolution becomes negligible. From the resulting outflows, we extract energy and velocity profiles and compute multi-wavelength afterglow light curves using a semi-analytic model that includes radial stratification and the full 3D jet geometry. More energetic or earlier-launched jets drill more efficiently through the ejecta, but all develop asymmetries that leave clear imprints in the off-axis afterglow light curves. All models exhibit a complex multi-shock breakout structure responsible for an early, dimmer peak in the afterglow. Despite structural differences, all simulated jets are consistent with the observational data of the multi-messenger BNS merger event GW170817.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter annihilation in the Galactic Centre with TRIDENT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the future sensitivity of the TRIDENT neutrino telescope to dark matter annihilation in the Galactic Centre. By applying the full detector design we show that TRIDENT will probe annihilation rates down to $\langle\sigma v\rangle\approx5\times10^{-27}\,{\rm cm}^3\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ for a $10\,{\rm TeV}$ dark matter, which is below the thermal freeze-out benchmark. The analysis is carried out with all-flavour neutrino interactions, where we demonstrate that cascade events, primarily due to $\nu_{e,\tau}$, show greater sensitivity to a dark matter signal compared to the more commonly studied track events. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of a previously overlooked background, Galactic neutrinos produced from interactions between hadronic cosmic rays and interstellar gas. We find dark matter sensitivities are more strongly degraded in the high energy region above $\sim 10\, {\rm TeV}$, with a maximal weakening of approximately a factor of $\sim 2$. This effect remains smaller than the uncertainty associated with the dark matter density profile but can nonetheless mimic a positive annihilation signal. We contextualize these results with a concrete particle model and show that TRIDENT will be able to probe the most interesting untested parts of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a subpopulation of hierarchical mergers in the GWTC-4 gravitational-wave dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repeated black-hole mergers in dense stellar clusters are a plausible mechanism to populate the predicted gap in black hole masses due to the pair-instability process. These hierarchical mergers carry distinct spin and tilt features relative to first-generation black holes, for which previous studies have found evidence at a population level by interpreting features in the effective inspiral spin domain. We introduce an astrophysically-motivated model in the joint space of effective inspiral and precessing spins, which captures the dominant spin dynamics expected for hierarchical mergers. We find decisive evidence both for a population transition above $\sim 45M_\odot$, consistent with the anticipated onset of the pair-instability gap, as well as a peak at $\sim 15 M_\odot$, which we interpret as the global peak in the hierarchical merger rate. The existence of low- and high-mass subpopulations of higher-generation black holes suggests the contribution of both near-solar-metallicity and metal-poor star clusters to the hierarchical merger population. Our results reinforce the growing evidence for detailed, mass-dependent substructure in the spin distribution of the binary black hole population.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Symmetry: Transformation Information for Planetary Nebulae and Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative symmetry-identification pipeline for astrophysical images based on Transformation Information (TI), an information measure of self-similarity under geometric transformations. TI is expressed as a Kullback-Leibler (cross-entropy) divergence between an image and its rotated or reflected counterpart on the overlapping domain. By scanning rotation angles and reflection axes, we obtain TI curves whose local minima identify symmetry operations. We validate the method on a wind-rose pattern and then apply it to planetary nebulae, where the recovered axes trace bipolar and multipolar lobes consistent with morphology-based classifications. Applying TI to supernova remnants yields estimate axes associated with protrusions, rims, and substructure. To emphasize global morphology, we introduce a thresholded two-level variant that compares binary silhouettes and can reveal outline-driven symmetries. Finally, we quantify symmetry using a minima prominence-to-width score and show that this compact descriptor separates Type Ia and core-collapse remnants into distinct populations for an X-ray sample. TI provides a non-parametric, reproducible framework for symmetry identification, classification and population studies.</description>

      <title>A persistent bow shock in a diskless magnetised accreting white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar bow shocks are formed when an outflow interacts with the interstellar medium. In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B~42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.</description>

      <title>General gravitational properties of neutron stars: curvature invariants, binding energy, and trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of curvature invariants for a large ensemble of neutron stars built with equations of state (EOSs) that satisfy constraints from nuclear theory and perturbative QCD, as well as measurements of neutron-star masses, radii, and gravitational waves from binary neutron-star mergers. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that stars with negative Ricci scalar $\mathcal{R}$ are rather common and about $\sim 50\%$ of our EOSs produce one or more stars with Ricci curvature that is negative somewhere inside the star. The negative curvature is found mostly but not exclusively at the highest densities and pressures, and predominantly for stiff EOSs and for the most compact and most massive stars. Furthermore, we improve the quasi-universal relation between the stellar gravitational mass $M$ and the baryonic mass $M_\mathrm{b}$, which allows us to express analytically one in terms of the other with a maximum variance of only $\sim 3\%$. Finally, using the relation between the Ricci scalar and the trace anomaly $\Delta$, we determine the conditions under which $\Delta$ vanishes or becomes negative in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Long Term (250 years) Hydrodynamical Simulation of the Supermassive Black Hole Binary OJ287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With upcoming facilities capable of detecting photometric and gravitational wave signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, studying their long-term accretion-driven variability is timely. OJ287 is a bright, nearby ($z=0.3$), and well-studied candidate for a SMBH binary. As such, it is an excellent case study for how binary dynamics could influence observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) photometric variability. We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of OJ287, using the code PHANTOM. We simulate two mass ratios: (i) M$_1$ $=$ 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with M$_2$ $=$ 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$, (ii) M$_1\approx$ M$_2$ ($\sim10^{8}$ M$_\odot$) along and (iii) control of a single SMBH and accretion disc. We find that the simulation with masses 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$ evolves consistently with the most currently accepted model of OJ287 as a precessing SMBH binary. The secondary's impacts with the disc result in the formation of spiral density waves and a corresponding $\sim$10-20% increases in the mass accretion rate of the primary SMBH. The impact timings and the mass accretion rate spikes show quasi-periodic variability as a result of the precession of the secondary's orbit with intervals between impacts ranging from $\sim$ 1 year to $\sim$ 10 years. In the near-equal mass case, the disc of the primary becomes tidally disrupted after $\sim$ 2 years. Consequently, the near-equal mass system with a period of 12 years is not a viable candidate for OJ287. This modeling provides insights into the potential signatures of SMBH binaries by both gravitational wave observatories and the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>The Secret Lives of Open Clusters: a Multiwavelength Examination of Three Open Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star clusters are well known for their dynamical interactions, an outcome of their high stellar densities; in this paper we use multiwavelength observations to search for the unique outcomes of these interactions in three nearby Galactic open clusters: IC 2602 (30 Myr), NGC 2632 (750 Myr) and M67 (4 Gyr). We compared X-ray observations from all-sky surveys like eROSITA, plus archival observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory, survey radio observations from ASKAP's Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey plus archival VLA observations, in conjunction with new cluster catalogs with Gaia. From X-ray, we found 77 X-ray sources likely associated with IC 2602, 31 X-ray sources in NGC 2632, and 31 near M67's central regions. We were further able to classify these X-ray sources based on their optical variability and any radio emission. Three IC 2602 X-ray sources had radio counterparts, which are likely all chromospherically active binary stars. We also identified luminous radio and X-ray variability from a spectroscopic triple system in M67, WOCS 3012/S1077, which is either consistent with a quiescent black hole binary, or due to an active binary stellar system. A recent population study of optical variables by Anderson &amp; Hunt 2025 shows that the population of optical variables in open clusters clearly changes over cluster age; this pilot study gives evidence that the X-ray population also changes with time, and demonstrates the need for a broader multiwavelength study of Galactic open clusters.</description>

      <title>Chiral three-nucleon forces for the new local position-space two-nucleon potential in $\textit{ab initio}$ many-body calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-nucleon force (3NF) plays an important role in understanding the structure of finite nuclei and the saturation properties of infinite nuclear matter. The chiral 3NF derived from the chiral effective field theory has been successful in $\textit{ab initio}$ studies of atomic nuclei. However, challenges remain, such as parameterizing low-energy constants and applying regulators. Most of established chiral nuclear forces have a nonlocal form in the momentum space. In this work, we construct local and hybrid local-nonlocal chiral 3NFs for the newly established Idaho local position-space two-nucleon potential, and calculate binding energies and radii of nuclei up to $^{132}$Sn. The two low-energy constants of 3NF are constrained by the ground-state energies of $^3$H and $^{16}$O, as suggested in a recent work. The chiral Hamiltonian obtained with the local-nonlocal regulator can simultaneously reproduce the experimental ground-state energies and charge radii of nuclei over a large range from $^4$He to $^{132}$Sn.</description>

      <title>Evidence of sloshing-driven mini-halo formation in the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio mini-halos are perplexing features, typically hosted by X-ray cool-core galaxy clusters. Understanding the connection between thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission is key to uncovering their origin. Here, we present a multiwavelength study of the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410 using archival Chandra X-ray and wideband uGMRT radio data (Bands 3, 4 and 5). Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\sim$42 kpc to the north-west. These cavities suggest that the AGN provides mechanical power of $\sim$$6.0 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the ICM. We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reproduce observed galaxy properties, cosmological simulations require that massive galaxies experience feedback from active galactic nuclei, which regulates star formation within those galaxies. However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained. We combine optical, infrared, sub-millimeter and radio observations of the active galaxy VV 340a, hosting a low-power jet launched from a supermassive black hole at its center. We find that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 $\pm~$5.5) $\times~$10$^5$ years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 $\pm~$7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Star Properties from Future High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to constrain NS radii with uncertainties as small as $\sigma \simeq 0.1$~km. Such unprecedented precision offers a unique opportunity to extract new information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Using mock radius data with uncertainties ranging from $\sigma = 1.0$ to $0.1$~km, together with a flexible meta-model NS EOS that allows for a first-order hadron-quark phase transition, we perform a Bayesian statistical analysis to assess the impact of radius measurements on EOS constraints. We find that high-precision radius measurements, particularly for massive NSs, significantly tighten constraints on the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, the quark matter mass fraction in NS cores, and several parameters characterizing the EOS of supranuclear hadronic matter, although the degree of improvement depends on the assumed prior range of $\rho_t$. In contrast, even with the highest precision considered, NS radii -- including those of massive stars -- remain largely insensitive to the stiffness of quark matter, independent of the measurement accuracy or the prior range adopted for $\rho_t$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IceCube is a Cherenkov detector instrumenting over a cubic kilometer of glacial ice deep under the surface of the South Pole. The DeepCore sub-detector lowers the detection energy threshold to a few GeV, enabling the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos. The reconstruction of neutrino interactions inside the detector is essential in studying neutrino oscillations. It is particularly challenging to reconstruct sub-100 GeV events with the IceCube detectors due to the relatively sparse detection units and detection medium. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly used in physics experiments for both classification and regression purposes. This paper discusses the CNNs developed and employed for the latest IceCube-DeepCore oscillation measurements. These CNNs estimate various properties of the detected neutrinos, such as their energy, direction of arrival, interaction vertex position, flavor-related signature, and are also used for background classification.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of ultra-high-energy neutrinos by IceCube marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. Yet, the origin and production mechanisms of these neutrinos remain an open question. With the observation of several neutrino events with energies about the PeV, transient sources - astrophysical objects that emit particles in brief, localized bursts - have emerged as promising candidates. In this work, we revisit the identification of such sources in IceCube and future neutrino telescopes, focusing on how both the timing and sky localization of the source affect the detection sensitivity. We present a framework to account for the source's right ascension in determining the effective area of detectors not located at the poles, such as KM3NeT. As a case study, we investigate evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) as transient neutrino sources, showing that the detection prospects and localization accuracy are strongly influenced by the PBH's position in the sky. Our results emphasize the complementarity between neutrino and gamma-ray observatories and showcase the potential of a global network of neutrino detectors to identify and localize transient events that might be missed by traditional photon-based instruments.</description>

      <title>The impact of kilonova seed photons on GRB VHE emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last several years, there have been a number of GRBs with very high energy (VHE) emission in excess of 100 GeV, and even above 1 TeV, detected. In several instances, synchrotron seed photons do not fully explain the emission observed, suggesting the presence of other seed photon sources to up-scatter. In this work, we consider the kilonova as a source of seed photons for up-scattering in the afterglow. We model the kilonova as a thermal source injecting into the back of a GRB fireball, evolved using a shell model, and with the electron and photon populations updated via a kinetic solver. We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those found in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova seed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission when afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in structured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also benefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis. We apply this model to GRB 170817A, and show that its VHE spectral flux is higher than expected in previous models for the first 100 d, though still below the detection threshold.</description>

      <title>SN 2024hpj: A perspective on SN 2009ip-like events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) IIn are terminal explosions of massive stars that are surrounded by a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Among SNe IIn, a notable subset is the SN 2009ip-like, which exhibits an initial, fainter peak attributed to stellar variability in the late evolutionary stages, followed by a brighter peak, interpreted as the SN explosion itself. In this context, we analysed the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2024hpj, an object with a triple-peaked light curve and spectra typical of a SN IIn but with a complex line profile composed of broad P-Cygni features topped by narrow emissions. Comparing it with other SN 2009ip-like events in the literature, as well as with other unpublished objects (SNe 2019mry, 2022ytx, 2024uzf, and 2025csc), we identify star-forming regions as their preferred formation environment. On the other hand, the diversity of spectrophotometric features within the sample suggests that variations in CSM mass and distribution may influence the observed characteristics. We identify four sub-classes based on the luminosity and rapidity of the light curve evolution, which provides insights into possible differences in the progenitors, while a statistical analysis of their observed rate indicates progenitor masses around 25 - 31 solar masses or lower.</description>

      <title>iPTF16geu through the lens of thermonuclear explosion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnification resulting from strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to add new constraints to the cosmic evolution of supernova progenitors by enabling the study of distant supernovae that would otherwise not be observable. iPTF16geu is the most well-observed gravitationally lensed supernova (glSN) to date. At a redshift of $z = 0.409$ and magnified by a factor of $\sim$68, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations have been obtained. The explosion mechanism producing this rare event and differences compared to lower redshift supernovae however have not been explored in detail. Here we compare observations of iPTF16geu to existing radiative transfer simulations of type Ia supernova explosion models selected from the literature. We find that overall the DDC6, PDDEL1, and N10 models produce the closest match to the light curves and many absorption features, providing some evidence in favour of the delayed detonation scenario. All models struggle however to replicate the observed colours and in particular the rest-frame UV. We also investigate the magnification and reddening values required to improve agreement with the selected models. Upcoming surveys will significantly increase the samples of SNe discovered at high redshifts due to strong gravitational lensing. These glSNe will enable tighter constraints on the explosion physics of type Ia supernovae and how this has evolved throughout the Universe.</description>

      <title>Coherence of Supermassive Black Hole Binary Demographics with the nHz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a refined estimation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) based on observed dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) together with AGN X-ray luminosity functions, in light of recent Pulsar Timing Array detections of an nHz SGWB. We identify a characteristic luminosity dependence in dual AGN fractions by compiling recent observational datasets, providing crucial constraints on supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) populations. Our AGN-based model reproduces the current SGWB measurements within PTA observational uncertainties of $2 - 4 \sigma$ uncertainties, demonstrating consistency between electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. These findings establish SMBHBs as the dominant source of the nHz gravitational wave signal, providing crucial insights into their demographics and evolution.</description>

      <title>Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.</description>

      <title>X-rays Emission: a novel tool to detect Extensive Air Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of detecting extensive air showers via their geo-synchrotron X-ray emission from high-altitude platforms. Starting from first principles, we derive a differential expression for the number of emitted photons per unit grammage and photon energy for an ensemble of gyrating shower electrons. The calculation uses noted parameterizations of the electron state variable distributions in the shower to establish a scale for the photon footprint and, further, takes into account the propagation of emitted photons in the atmosphere. The computed fluxes at the position of the detector are used to estimate the detector acceptance and event rate using a bootstrap Monte Carlo procedure. For a 1 m radius and 70{\deg} half-aperture circular detector at an altitude between 20 to 30 km viewing the Earth's limb, we find acceptances at the 1 $\mathrm{m^2 sr}$ level and integral event rates of roughly 10 per month. These results indicate that X-ray geo-synchrotron emission is a promising, complimentary channel for high-altitude indirect cosmic ray detection in the PeV regime.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the potential of KM3NeT in detecting core-collapse supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae mark the end of life of massive stars. However, despite their importance in astrophysics, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neutrinos that emerge from the dense core of the star offer a promising way to study supernova dynamics. A strategy is presented to improve the potential of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope to detect core-collapse supernovae in our Galaxy or the Large Magellanic Cloud by further exploiting the properties of its optical modules equipped with multiple photomultipliers. A supernova burst is expected to produce a sudden hit rate increase in the KM3NeT detectors. New observables have been defined for individual optical modules that exploit the geometry and time distribution of the detected hits, enabling a better discrimination between signal and background signatures. In addition, a thorough investigation of the related systematic uncertainties is presented for the first time. When implemented, this new methodology allowed KM3NeT to probe 46% more Galactic core-collapse supernova candidates than with the previous trigger strategy, reaching the dense Galactic bulge. It is now expected that, once completed, KM3NeT will achieve full Galactic sensitivity to core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>A secondary orbiter under collisions with an accretion disk</title>

Abstract: Dynamics of stellar orbits in dense stellar systems and nuclear star clusters (NSC) with an embedded supermassive black hole (SMBH) is governed a complex interplay of different forces. In particular, star--star gravitational collisions (relaxation), physical collisions between stars, and the hydrodynamical interaction with any surrounding gaseous environment, such as an accretion disk. These processes influence the stellar distribution, the feeding of the central black hole, and the generation of observable phenomena. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the accretion medium modulates the long-term evolution, adding significant complexity to the system's dynamics. By employing elementary arguments we outline the mentioned influences in their mutual competition.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength properties of changing-state active galactic nuclei: I. the evolution of soft excess and X-ray continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changing-state active galactic nuclei (CSAGNs) exhibit rapid variability, with mass accretion rates that can change by several orders of magnitude in a few years. This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the inner accretion flow almost in real time. Here, we used over 1000 observations to study the broadband X-ray spectra of a sample of five CSAGNs, spanning three orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$), using phenomenological models to trace the evolution of key spectral components. We derive several fundamental parameters, such as the photon index, soft excess strength, reflection strength, and luminosities of the soft excess and primary continuum. We find that the soft excess and primary continuum emissions show a very strong positive correlation ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), suggesting a common physical origin. The soft excess strength does not show any dependency on the reflection parameter, suggesting that in these objects the soft excess is not dominated by a blurred ionized reflection process. On the other hand, the strength of the soft excess is found to be strongly positively correlated with the Eddington ratio ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), and we find that the soft excess vanishes below $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim -2.5$. Moreover, we find a clear `V'-shaped relation for $\Gamma-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, with a break at $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} = -2.47 \pm 0.09$. Our findings indicate a change in the geometry of the inner accretion flow at low Eddington ratios, and that the soft excess is primarily produced via warm Comptonization.</description>

      <title>Evidence for strong isovector nuclear spin-orbit interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nucleon spin-orbit interaction is a cornerstone of nuclear structure theory, yet its isospin dependence remains elusive owing to the lack of clean experimental probes. Here we show that the charge-weak form factor difference in $^{48}$Ca, recently extracted in a model-independent manner by the CREX experiment, exhibits strong sensitivity to the isovector spin-orbit interaction. Using Skyrme-like energy density functionals, we demonstrate that a significantly enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction, about four times stronger than conventional parametrizations, can resolve the PREX-CREX puzzle, which has challenged modern nuclear theories and our understanding of nuclear symmetry energy, while maintaining a good description of nuclear bulk properties and well-established shell structure of finite nuclei. This enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction also provides a novel mechanism for the emergence of the $N = 14$, $16$, $32$ and $34$ magic numbers in neutron-rich nuclei on the mean-field level. These findings point to a strong isospin dependence of the nucleon spin-orbit interaction, which is expected to have important implications for nuclear structures, electroweak nuclear processes, and related problems in nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in dark matter halos: dynamics and distinguishability of halo models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), a key target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be affected in the presence of dark matter (DM) halos. In this paper we explore whether the effects of DM are detectable by LISA within a fully relativistic framework. We model the massive EMRI component as a nonrotating black hole (BH) surrounded by a DM halo. We compute axial and polar GW fluxes for circular orbits at linear order in the mass ratio for DM density profiles with varying mass and compactness. By comparing the phase evolution with vacuum systems, we find that DM halos can induce dephasings of tens to hundreds of radians over a one-year observation period. We demonstrate that even highly diluted DM distributions can significantly affect the emitted waveforms, and that the resulting GW signals can usually be distinguished from each other. While it is important to generalize these findings to more generic orbits and to spinning BHs, our results suggest that LISA could not only reveal the presence of DM halos, but also discriminate between different halo models.</description>

      <title>Could a Primordial Black Hole Explosion Explain the extremely high-energy KM3NeT neutrino Event?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A black hole is expected to end its lifetime in a cataclysmic runaway burst of Hawking radiation, emitting all Standard Model particles with ultra-high energies. Thus, the explosion of a nearby primordial black hole (PBH) has been proposed as a possible explanation for the $\sim 220$~PeV neutrino-like event recently reported by the KM3NeT collaboration. If the event originated from a PBH, the source would need to lie at $(1-7)\times 10^{-5} \mathrm{pc}$ - depending on the assumed effective area - thus within the Solar System. At such proximity, the resulting flux of gamma rays and cosmic rays would be detectable at Earth. By incorporating the time-dependent field of view of gamma-ray observatories, we show that LHAASO should have recorded $\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ events between fourteen and seven hours prior to the KM3NeT detection. IceCube and KM3NeT \textit{itself} should likewise have detected of order a few hundred events in the range $1~\mathrm{TeV} \lesssim E_\nu \lesssim 1~\mathrm{PeV}$ during the 24 hours preceding the burst. The absence of any such multi-messenger signal, particularly in gamma-ray data, strongly disfavors the interpretation of the KM3-230213A event as arising from evaporation in a minimal four-dimensional Schwarzschild scenario.</description>

      <title>A $\tau-$DM relation for FRB hosts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation is correct.</description>

      <title>Investigating Production of TeV-scale Muons in Extensive Air Shower at 2400 Meters Underground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep underground experiments present a new avenue to probe the first interactions in extensive air showers or hadronic interactions in the extreme forward phase space. The China Jinping Underground Laboratory, characterized by a vertical rock overburden of 2,400~m, provides an exceptionally effective shield against cosmic muons with energies below 3~TeV. The surviving high-energy muons, produced in the first interactions of extensive air showers, open a unique observational window into primary cosmic rays from tens of TeV to up the PeV scale and beyond. This distinctive feature also enables detailed studies of charged hadron production in the earliest stages of shower development. Using 1,338.6 live days of data collected with a one-ton prototype detector for the Jinping Neutrino Experiment, we measured the underground muon flux originating from air showers. The results show discrepancies of about 40\% corresponding to significances of more than 2$\sigma$ (including model-related uncertainties) and 5.5$\sigma$ (excluding them), relative to predictions from several leading hadronic interaction models. We interpret these findings from two complementary perspectives: (i) by adopting the expected cosmic-ray spectra, we constrain the modeling of the first hadronic interactions in air showers and provide novel insights into resolving the long-standing \textit{muon puzzle}; and (ii) by assuming specific hadronic interaction models, we infer the mass composition of cosmic rays, and our data favor a lighter component in the corresponding energy range. Our study demonstrates the potential of deep underground laboratories to provide new experimental insights into air shower physics and cosmic rays.</description>
