      <title>Can the X(1750) be a $\Phi$(1750)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the arguments that the X(1750) has the isospin $I=0$, and as such, it belongs to the $\phi$ family. We base our argumentation on the X(1750) appearing in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow K^+ K^-$ process as a narrow resonance and not appearing in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-$ process at all.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Navier-Stokes description of the quark-gluon plasma radial flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic viscous hydrodynamic description of the quark-gluon plasma by M\"uller-Israel-Stewart formulations has been very successful, but despite this success, these theories present limitations regarding well-posedness and causality. In recent years, a well-behaved version of the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations has been formulated, appearing as a promising alternative in which those limitations are absent. Using this novel theory, we perform numerical simulations of a quark-gluon plasma fluid that we use to describe experimental data on the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons from central Pb-Pb collisions measured at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Probing new forces with nuclear-clock quintessometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clocks based on nuclear isomer transitions promise exceptional stability and precision. The low transition energy of the Thorium-229 isomer makes it an ideal candidate, as it may be excited by a vacuum-ultraviolet laser and is highly sensitive to subtle interactions. This enables the development of powerful tools for probing new forces, which we call quintessometers. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of nuclear clocks, particularly solid-state variants, to surpass existing limits on scalar field couplings, exceeding the sensitivity of current fifth-force searches at submicron distances and significantly improving equivalence-principle tests at kilometer scales and beyond. Additionally, we highlight the capability of transportable nuclear clocks to detect scalar interactions at distances beyond $10\,$km, complementing space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Probing the flavour-blind SMEFT: EFT validity and the interplay of energy scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) offers a systematic approach to study potential deviations from the Standard Model (SM) through higher-dimensional operators that encapsulate new physics effects. In this work, we analyze flavour-blind SMEFT contributions to flavour observables and assess their interplay with high-energy measurements from LEP and LHC. We perform global fits combining LEP precision data, flavour observables from rare B-meson decays, and LHC diboson measurements, revealing how the inclusion of different datasets breaks parameter degeneracies and enhances the sensitivity to SMEFT coefficients. Our study demonstrates that low-energy flavour observables provide reliable constraints even in flavour-blind scenarios, while high-energy measurements can be subject to EFT validity concerns due to kinematic growth. We investigate the impact of renormalization group evolution (RGE) and operator mixing across energy scales, highlighting the complementary nature of low- and high-energy datasets. The results emphasize the importance of flavour observables as robust probes of new physics and underline the necessity of global fits to avoid potential biases from limited datasets. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the interpretation of global SMEFT analyses based on high-energy collider data, comparing UV models that contribute to SMEFT at tree- and loop-level.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis with perturbations in type-II and type-III seesaw models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density perturbations have recently been shown to lead to a novel effect in the freeze-out of heavy particles called "acoustically driven freeze-out." This leads to an enhancement in the yield in standard leptogenesis. We extend this calculation to include $2 \to 2$ washout processes in type-I leptogenesis and the Sommerfeld-enhanced $2 \to 2$ gauge annihilations in type-II and type-III leptogenesis. These CP conserving annihilations suppress the yield of heavy particles sourcing the asymmetry. We show the acoustically driven freeze-out leads to novel enhancements in the baryon asymmetry in type-II and type-III leptogenesis, already in the weak washout regime, in contrast with type-I leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmic neutrino background on black hole superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the effect of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) on the superradiant phase caused by an ultralight scalar field around a spinning black hole (BH). When the scalar-neutrino Yukawa coupling $y_{\phi \nu}$ reaches values near $10^{-16}$ for astrophysical black holes (ApBHs) or $10^{-20}$ for supermassive black holes (SMBHs), thermal field theory corrections to the scalar field self-interaction drive superradiant instability, regardless of whether the scalar field constitutes dark matter. Additionally, we assess how these thermal corrections influence the scalar field mass $m_\phi$. In scenarios lacking self-interactions, these effects impose stricter constraints on the parameter space of the scalar field. Assuming two degenerate C$\nu$B neutrino masses and an inverted mass ordering, these Yukawa couplings constrain $y_{\phi \nu}$ to values as large as $10^{-6}$ for ApBHs and $10^{-11}$ for SMBHs, with comparable results for massless neutrinos or normal mass ordering. We also examine the robustness of these findings in light of astrophysical uncertainties near the BH and highlight prospects for future observational discoveries.</description>

      <title>Periodic Cosmic String Formation and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study string formation and dynamics in a scalar field theory with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. If a scalar field $\Phi$ is initially displaced from the minimum of a wine-bottle potential, even if uniformly over large spatial patches, small spatial perturbations to $\Phi$ grow via parametric resonance as $\Phi$ oscillates; this occurs for a wide range of initial $U(1)$ charge densities. The growth of perturbations leads to the formation of spatially coherent, temporally stable "counter-rotating regions" (CRR): spatially connected regions exhibiting $\Phi$ evolution with large, opposite-sign rotation speeds in field space which persist over long durations. These CRR are separated by domain boundaries that have a large field gradient and zero rotational speed in field space. String or vortex topological defects form, are confined to, and then annihilate periodically on these boundaries. We demonstrate these periodic dynamics with numerical simulations in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, in both Minkowski spacetime and in a radiation-dominated FLRW universe, and we explain some features of the evolution (semi-)analytically. At late times in an expanding universe, when $\Phi$ approaches the potential minimum, the CRR and vortices dissipate into scalar radiation. Phenomenologically, periodic bursts of string formation and annihilation can lead to periodic bursts of gravitational-wave production. For small initial $U(1)$ charge density, these gravitational-wave bursts can be synchronized across the whole Universe. Owing to their periodic nature, they could give rise to a gravitational-wave frequency spectrum consisting of a forest of peaks. These periodic scalar field dynamics also occur with large, untuned initial $U(1)$ charge density; they may thus have implications for models that depend on a coherent field rotation, such as kination and the axion kinetic-misalignment mechanism.

      <title>Leading order, next-to-leading order, and non-perturbative parton collision kernels: Effects on the jet substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important signature of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a high-precision energy-loss model is essential to independently verify the QGP properties extracted from soft particles. In this work, we optimize the energy loss modeling in MARTINI by introducing the formation time of the parton shower in the initial hard scattering, which is essential for a simultaneous description of the hadron and jet $R_{AA}$. Based on this, we study the phenomenological influence of the higher order collision kernels -- the up-to-NLO one evaluated by EQCD and the non-perturbative (NP) one computed in lattice QCD -- on the energy loss of the hard parton, compared to the LO kernel. The hadron and jet $R_{AA}$ are calculated with AMY rates using the three kernels and the optimized parameter sets for the running coupling. The results exhibit remarkable similarities in their overall values as well as in $p_T$ and centrality dependence. Sizable differences in the jet substructure are observed between different soft radiation rates.</description>

      <title>Probing the couplings of axion-like particle with leptons via three-lepton final state processes at future $e^{-}p$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-Like Particle (ALP) is one of the best motivated particles beyond the Standard Model (SM). We explore the possibility of detecting the couplings of ALP with leptons via three-lepton final state processes $e^- p \to e^- j a~(a \to \ell^+ \ell^-)$ at the LHeC (FCC-eh). For completeness, we investigate the cases where the ALP decays not only into electron and muon pairs but also into tau pairs, and perform a detailed simulation for the decays of taus. We find that the prospective sensitivities of the LHeC (FCC-eh) with the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1.3~(3.5)$ TeV and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=1~ (2)$ ab$^{-1}$ to the ALP-lepton couplings are not covered by the current and expected exclusion regions in some ALP mass intervals.</description>

      <title>Higgs in The Cosmos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Higgs particle in the cosmic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) below the electroweak phase transition temperature $T_\mathrm{EW}\simeq 125\mathrm{\,GeV}$. We show that Higgs is neither in abundance (chemical) nor in momentum distribution equilibrium in certain stages of the Universe evolution. Nonequilibrium originates in: For chemical nonequilibrium in the always present irreversible decays into virtual heavy gauge bosons, and; For $T&lt;25$\,GeV in relatively rapid $2\leftrightarrow 1$ formation and decay processes yielding momentum distribution as created in these reactions. As heavy particles disappear, the minimal Higgs coupling to abundant low mass particles fails in $2\to2$ (two-particle) scattering processes to assure a kinetic distribution equilibrium. The expansion of the Universe is by more than 10 orders of magnitude slower compared to microscopic processes. All other particles in the Universe are in full thermal equilibrium, with exception of the late in QGP evolution of the bottom flavor near to hadronization condition.</description>

      <title>Analysis of triply charmed four-quark state in the effective Lagrangian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the work we study the production and decay of triply charmed four-quark state with $J^P=1^+$ under the phenomenological analysis and effective Lagrangian approach. On the SU(3) symmetric analysis of golden channels, we further explore the dynamics of the processes, based on the assumption of molecule $T_{\eta_c D^*}$ and $T_{J/\psi D^*}$. Our results indicate that the production branching ratio from $B_c$ meson is sizable, it can reach the order of $10^{-4}$ for the molecular configuration $T_{{\eta}_cD^*}$, and $10^{-5}$ for molecule $T_{J/\psi D^*}$. In addition, we found that the decay widths of the two molecular configurations $T_{{\eta}_cD^*}$ and $T_{J/\psi D^*}$ are not significant, both at level of $\cal{O}$($\rm {MeV}$).</description>

      <title>On possibility of $\pi^0$ condensation and magnetization in freely interpenetrating nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditions are found, at which in the nuclear matter there may appear a spatially nonuniform $p$ wave $\pi^0$ condensate supplemented by a spatially varying spontaneous magnetization. The pion-nucleon interaction and the anomaly contributions to the magnetization are taken into account. Response of the system on the external magnetic field is also considered. Then the model of nonoverlapped nucleon Fermi spheres is employed. Arguments are given in favor of the possibility of the occurrence of the $\pi^0$-condensation and a spatially varying magnetization as well as effects of pronounced anisotropic pion fluctuations at finite pion momentum in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. Relevant effects such as response on the rotation, charged pion condensation and other are discussed.</description>

      <title>Interacting mesons as degrees of freedom in a chiral model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equation of state of hot and dense hadronic matter using an extended Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model framework where the addition is the inclusion of interactions of thermally excited mesons. This is implemented by calculating the in-medium masses of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, obtained through the explicit chiral symmetry-breaking and vector interaction terms in the Lagrangian, respectively, prior to applying the mean-field approximation. As a result, the in-medium meson contributions generate a feedback term to the CMF's equations of motion, which then modifies the equation of state. With this improvement, we quantify the effect on the equation of state of strongly interacting matter through comparisons with state-of-the-art lattice QCD results and other hadronic models like the Hadron Resonance Gas model. We find that the results of the updated hadronic CMF model with an improved meson description (mCMF) provide a better agreement with lattice-QCD data for thermodynamic state variables across a wide range of temperatures and baryon chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magic in Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum computing, non-stabilizerness -- the magic -- refers to the computational advantage of certain quantum states over classical computers and is an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. Employing the second order stabilizer R\'enyi entropy to quantify magic, we study the production of magic states in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) via 2-to-2 scattering processes involving electrons and muons. Considering all 60 stabilizer initial states, which have zero magic, the angular dependence of magic produced in the final states is governed by only a few patterns, both in the non-relativistic and the ultra-relativistic limits. Some processes, such as the low-energy $e^-\mu^-\to e^-\mu^-$ and Bhabha scattering $e^-e^+\to e^-e^+$, do not generate magic at all. In most cases the largest magic generated is significantly less than the maximal possible value of $\log (16/7) \approx 0.827$. The only instance where QED is able to generate maximal magic is the low-energy $\mu^-\mu^+\to e^-e^+$, in the limit $m_e/m_\mu \to 0$, which is well approximated in nature. Our results suggest QED, although capable of producing maximally entangled states easily, may not be an efficient mechanism for generating quantum advantages.</description>

Abstract: Curvature perturbations induce gravitational waves (GWs) at second order, contributing to the stochastic gravitational wave background. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs, particularly if they end rapidly. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls), for example. Prior analysis approximated the end of the eMD epoch as instantaneous or used a Gaussian smoothing. In this work, we present a complete analysis fully incorporating their time-evolving decay rates. We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra from PBH, thin wall Q-ball, thick wall Q-ball, and delayed Q-ball eMD epochs are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions. We then consider log-normal mass distributions and discuss the distinguishability of the various GW spectra. Importantly we find that the change in the spectrum from a finite mass width is qualitatively different from the change arising from a slower transition to radiation domination.</description>

      <title>Bilateral constraints on proton Lorentz violation effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the early reports of events beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, the investigation of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays has emerged as a fundamental method for testing Lorentz Invariance violation (LV) effects. Recent advances in observational capabilities have resulted in more stringent constraints on LV parameters. This study delves into the potentially anomalous phenomena arising from subluminal and superluminal LV effects, encompassing aspects such as proton decay and atypical threshold behavior of photo-pion production from protons within the GZK region. High-energy proton observations in cosmic rays have imposed stringent constraints on superluminal proton LV effects, while the confirmation of the GZK cutoff has established a robust boundary for the anomalous phenomena associated with subluminal proton LV effects. The research provides rigorously bilateral constraints on proton LV effects from both subluminal and superluminal standpoints.</description>

Abstract: The story of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_{\mu}$, has been a long and absorbing read, with several unexpected plot twists. The theme: is new physics visible in $a_{\mu}$ or not? is clearly an important one. As we head towards what may be the final chapters, the pace of the narrative has quickened and lattice QCD is providing a critical new perspective on some of the key characters. I will review the story so far, focussing on recent episodes but (spoiler alert) depending on your point of view, it may not be heading to a happy ending.</description>

      <title>Holographic derivation of effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a holographic prescription for the Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path, we derive the effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid holographically described by the Einstein gravity in an asymptotic AdS spacetime. In the saddle point approximation for the dual gravity, the goal is achieved by solving the double Dirichlet problem for the linearized gravitational field living in a complexified static AdS black brane background. We adopt a partially on-shell scheme for solving the bulk dynamics, which is equivalent to ``integrating out'' the gapped modes in the boundary field theory. The boundary effective action in the fluid spacetime, identified as the partially on-shell bulk action, is computed to first order in boundary derivative and to cubic order in AdS boundary data. The boundary effective action, rewritten in the physical spacetime, successfully reproduces various results known in the framework of classical hydrodynamics, confirming our holographic derivation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration of the QCD phase diagram is pivotal in particle and nuclear physics. We construct a full four-dimensional equation of state of QCD with net baryon, electric charge, and strangeness by extending the NEOS model beyond the conventional two-dimensional approximation. Lattice QCD calculations based on the Taylor expansion method and the hadron resonance gas model are considered for the construction. We also develop an efficient numerical method for applying the four-dimensional equation of state to relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, which can be used for the analysis of nuclear collisions at beam energy scan energies and for different nuclear species at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Canonical differential equations for the elliptic two-loop five-point integral family relevant to $t\bar t +$jet production at leading colour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present differential equations (DEs) in canonical form for a family of two-loop five-point Feynman integrals containing elliptic functions and nested square roots. This is the only family for which canonical DEs were not yet available among those required to compute the two-loop leading-colour amplitude for top-pair production in association with a jet at hadron colliders. We write the DEs in terms of one-forms having (locally) simple poles at all singular points, and highlight the `duplet' structure that generalises the even/odd charge of square roots to nested roots. All transcendental functions in the DEs are expressed in closed form using complete elliptic integrals, while one-forms free of elliptic functions are given in terms of logarithms, including those with the nested roots. In addition to marking a significant step towards next-to-next-to-leading order QCD predictions for an important LHC process, this work represents the first time that a canonical basis of integrals involving elliptic functions has been obtained for a five-particle process.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrinos by Hydrogen-rich Supernovae interacting with low-massive Circumstellar Medium: The Case of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hydrogen-rich (H-rich) Supernova (SN) events, the collision between the H-rich ejecta and the Circum-Stellar Medium (CSM) can accelerate particles and produce high-energy neutrinos (HE-$\nu$, TeV-PeV) through proton-proton inelastic scattering. Despite understanding the production mechanism of these neutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle acceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study focuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN 2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor and CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux at Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino emission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the spatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve of SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta, consisting of $9\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ (including $0.07\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\,\text{foe}$, collides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ distributed according to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through these parameters, we estimate that up to $4\pm1\times 10^{-2}$ muon (anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days post-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\lesssim 3\times 10^{-9}\,\text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$) is below current IceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could detect HE-$\nu$ from similar SN events.</description>

Abstract: We determine the form of dissipative currents at the first order in relativistic spin hydrodynamics with finite chemical potential including gradients of the spin potential. Taking advantage of isotropy in the hydrodynamic local rest frame, using a suitable matching condition for the flow velocity and enforcing the semi-positivity of entropy production, we find 23 dissipative transport coefficients relating dissipative currents to gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields: 4 for the symmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor, 5 for the antisymmetric part, 3 for the conserved vector current, and 11 for the spin tensor. We compare our finding with previous results in literature.</description>

      <title>$B_c$ to $A$ Transition Form Factors and Semileptonic Decays in Self-consistent Covariant Light-front Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03655v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the semileptonic weak decays of $B_c$ meson decaying to axial-vector ($A$) mesons for bottom-conserving and bottom-changing decay modes. We employ self-consistent covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM) that uses type-II correspondence to eliminate inconsistencies in the traditional type-I CLFQM. As a fresh attempt, we test the self-consistency in CLFQM through type-II correspondence for $B_c \to A$ meson transition form factors. We establish that in type-II correspondence the form factors for longitudinal and transverse polarization states are numerically equal and are free from zero-mode contributions, which confirms the self-consistency of type-II correspondence for $B_c \to A$ transition form factors. Furthermore, we ascertain that the problems of inconsistency and violation of covariance of CLFQM within the type-I correspondence are resolved in type-II correspondence for $B_c \to A$ transitions. We thoroughly investigate the effects of self-consistency between type-I and type-II schemes using a comparative analysis. We also study the $q^2$ dependence of the form factors in weak hadronic currents for the whole accessible kinematic range $0 \leqslant q^2 \leqslant q^2_{max}$ for both bottom-conserving as well as bottom-changing transitions. In addition, we extend our analysis to predict the branching ratios of the semileptonic weak decays of $B_c$ meson involving axial-vector meson in the final state to quantify the effects of self-consistency in these decays that were not studied before. We evaluate the lepton mass effect on these branching ratios and various other important physical observables, such as forward-backward asymmetries, lepton-side convexity parameter, asymmetry parameter, and longitudinal polarization asymmetries and fractions. Finally, we obtain the lepton flavor universality ratios for various decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the production of doubly charmed baryon from anti-bottom charmed meson. Using the effective Lagrangian approach, we discuss triangle diagrams in hadronic level to get access to the branching ratios of $\overline{B}_c\to \mathcal{B}_{ccq}+\mathcal{B}_{\bar c\bar q\bar q}$. It seems that the specific process $\overline {B}_c \to \Xi_{cc}^{++} \, \overline {\Xi}_{\bar c}^{'-}$ occupies the largest possibility in the order of $6.68\times 10^{-6}$. In addition, although the production of undiscovered $\Omega_{cc}^+$ is Cabibbo suppressed in $\overline B_c\to \Omega_{cc}^+ \, \overline {\Xi}_{\bar c}^0$, it's branching ratio can still reach $10^{-7}$ level. These results are excepted to be fairly valuable supports for future experiments.</description>

Abstract: Energetic cosmic rays scatter off the cosmic neutrino background throughout the history of the Universe, yielding a diffuse flux of cosmic relic neutrinos boosted to high energies. We calculate this flux under different assumptions of the cosmic-ray flux spectral slope and redshift evolution. The non-observation of the diffuse flux of boosted relic neutrinos with current high-energy neutrino experiments already excludes an average cosmic neutrino background overdensity larger than $\sim 10^{4}$ over cosmological distances. We discuss the future detectability of the diffuse flux of boosted relic neutrinos in light of neutrino overdensity estimates and cosmogenic neutrino backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical conservation of the lepton number is an accidental symmetry present in the Standard Model (SM). Thus, we consider here a scenario where the SM is extended with a U(1) gauge group, promoting the lepton number to a local symmetry. The gauge anomaly cancellations necessitate the extension of the particle spectrum with several beyond the SM (BSM) particle fields. The extended lepton gauge group breaks around the TeV scale via spontaneous symmetry breaking, and a $Z_2$ symmetry remains, which ensures the stability of the light $Z_2$ odd BSM particles. Interestingly, the particle spectrum of the model has two distinct dark sectors, with one having a Dirac-type DM and the other one containing a Majorana-type DM, thus resulting in a multipartite dark matter scenario. We have explored the available parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density and direct detection measurements for both of the DM particles. Having a Majorana dark matter, we have also studied for the gamma line signatures to constrain the parameter space from the indirect dark matter detection experiments like FermiLAT and CTA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking predict a strong first order cosmological phase transition: we compute the resulting signals, primordial black holes and gravitational waves. These theories employ one SM-neutral scalar, plus some extra model-dependent particle to get the desired quantum potential out of classical scale invariance. We consider models where the extra particle is a scalar singlet, or vectors of an extended U(1) or SU(2) gauge sector. In models where the extra particle is stable, it provides a particle Dark Matter candidate with freeze-out abundance that tends to dominate over primordial black holes. These can instead be DM in models without a particle DM candidate. Gravitational waves arise at a level observable in future searches, even in regions where DM cannot be directly tested.</description>

Abstract: In the study, we present an analytical solution of the Dirac equation in a generalized tanh-shape hyperbolic potential, which allows us to unify various well-known quantum potentials under a single theoretical framework. This versatile potential model is used to compute the mass spectra for charmonium and bottomonium, with excellent agreement with experimental measurements and does better than some potential models in predicting the several orbital states. Our results not only validate the GTHP as a powerful tool for describing heavy quarkonium systems but also suggest its broader applicability in exploring quantum systems where similar potentials are effective. This work is a stepping stone for new research into fermionic systems with complex interactions, by jointly providing insights into foundational aspects of quantum mechanics as well as applications in particle physics.</description>

Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation for spin-one bottomonium coupled to quark and gluon propagators is solved in a class of non-trivial linear gauges.
  The interaction kernel is based on a known gluon propagator extrapolated from the lattice and contains only small amount of additional phenomenology. The first numerical results are obtained in the Feynman gauge where the associated problem with infrared divergences is circumvented by by introducing a symmetry breaking regulator mass $m_L$. The presence of this mass renders the bound state vertices of vector states finite but
  it is also necessary to prevent inconsistent solutions of the bound state equation. For $m_L\simeq \Lambda_{QCD}$ it gives us good agreement
  with the experimental data for vector and axial vector bottomonia below the $BB$ threshold. While the primary concern pertains to the physical ramifications of the proposed concept,
  a potential origin for the proposed interaction is also presented.</description>

This includes using auxiliary detectors to distinguish the main signal from background signals and implementing post-measurement corrections, such as the Bayesian statistics method, to address uncontrolled factors during the experiments. Asymmetry values in the scattering of electrons off proton targets in QWeak and P2 and off electron targets in MOLLER are influenced by detector array configurations, beam polarization angles, and beam spin variations. The Bayesian framework refines full probabilistic models to account for all necessary factors, thereby extracting asymmetry values and the underlying physics under specified conditions. For the QWeak experiment, a reanalysis of the inelastic asymmetry measurement using the Bayesian method has yielded a closer fit to measured asymmetries, with uncertainties reduced by 40\% compared to the Monte Carlo minimization method. This approach was successfully applied to simulated data for the MOLLER experiment and is predicted to be similarly effective in P2.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06038v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. By comparing the axion effect with thermal effect on the width $\Delta B$, we have shown the dominance of the axion effect over thermal effect at low temperature less than $50$mK. The dominance of the axion effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</description>

      <title>Two portals to GeV sterile neutrinos : dipole versus mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive sterile neutrinos, also known as heavy neutral leptons, can have a mixing with active neutrinos, $\theta$, as well as a dipole coupling to the photon, $d$. We study the interplay between these two portals, considering the production from meson decays of sterile neutrinos with mass $0.1$ GeV $\lesssim M_N \lesssim 10$ GeV, at beam-dump facilities such as NA62 and SHiP, and at the FASER2 experiment. These sterile neutrinos can be long-lived and decay into a photon in a distant detector, via the dipole operator. We find that all these experiments will be sensitive to values of $d$ which are presently unconstrained. The experimental reach varies strongly with the mass $M_N$ and the mixing $\theta$, and one observes specific correlations with the flavour of active neutrinos. The SHiP experiment will mark a jump in sensitivity: (i) it will probe a sterile dipole as small as $d\sim 10^{-8}$ GeV$^{-1}$, thus testing new physics well above the electroweak scale; (ii) it may detect the active-sterile dipole to the level predicted by electroweak loops, if $\theta$ is close to the present bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear modification and the universality of short-range correlation (SRC) in pion-induced Drell-Yan process. Employing nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and pion PDFs, the ratio of differential cross sections of different nuclei relative to the free nucleon is presented. A kind of universal modification function was proposed which would provide nontrivial tests of SRC universality on the platform of pion-induced Drell-Yan. This work improves our understanding of nuclear structure and strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Excited s-wave $1^{--}$ vector mesons, their leptonic decays and (in-)complete absence of abnormal states as seen from the constituent quark BSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within a lattice inspired interaction between quark and antiquark, we obtain a hierarchy of solutions to the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for vector quarkonia excited states in the constituent quark mass approximation. As a toy model, we apply the similar to calculate ground and excited states of $\phi$ and $\omega/\rho$ meson. Through detailed numerical searches, our study provides evidence that the single-valued constant mass quark propagator does not yield known meson spectra without the simultaneous presence of abnormal (unphysical) solutions. We classify normal and abnormal solutions and discuss necessary changes in the calculation scheme to avoid the spectrum of inconsistent solutions. While all experimental narrow vector mesons are identified with a normal state of the BSE, the occurrence of mutually cancelled normal-abnormal states are reported. The results are slightly different for the heavy and light mesons, but in both cases they seem to result from the inconsistent use of the hmogeneous BSE to describe broad resonances.</description>

      <title>Models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study six-dimensional $SU(n)$ gauge models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$. In the absence of continuous Wilson line phases, product group unification models can be constructed based on $SU(7)$ and $SU(8)$ gauge models. When continuous Wilson line phases are present, we find that a minimal model, namely, an $SU(6)$ gauge model, can describe the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry. In addition, this model has excellent features that two Higgs doublets appear from the zero modes of the extra-dimensional gauge field, and the quarks in each generation can be unified into one multiplet, without exotic quarks, as the zero modes of a bulk field in the $\boldsymbol{15}$ representation of $SU(6)$. We show that there exists a vacuum where the electroweak symmetry is slightly broken, as a minimum of the effective potential for the continuous Wilson line phases, by adding suitable bulk fields, in a toy model. This electroweak symmetry breaking can be naturally understood in terms of the two Higgs doublet model, and mass eigenstates of the neutral Higgs bosons are examined, including the component corresponding to the nonflat direction, which does not appear in the continuous Wilson line phases. We also discuss the tadpole terms of the field strength localized on fixed points. We show that their direct contributions to the Higgs masses can be forbidden by a reflection symmetry, and thus, quadratic divergences are not reintroduced into the Higgs masses not only at one-loop level but also at higher orders.</description>

      <title>Exploring sub-GeV dark matter via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance annihilation with CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit constraints on sub-GeV dark matter (DM) annihilation via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance processes using current and future CMB data from Planck, FIRAS, and upcoming experiments such as LiteBIRD, CMB-S4, PRISTINE, and PIXIE. For $s$-wave annihilation, we provide updated limits for both $e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\pi\pi$ channels, with the profile likelihood method yielding stronger constraints than the marginal posterior method. In the $p$-wave case, we comprehensively present a model-independent inequality for the 95\% upper limits from FIRAS, PRISTINE, and PIXIE, with future experiments expected to surpass current BBN limits. For resonance annihilation, we report -- for the first time -- the $95\%$ upper limits on the decay branching ratio of the mediator particle, when the resonance peaks during the recombination epoch. Overall, our study highlights the complementary strengths of $\mu$-distortion and CMB anisotropies in probing sub-GeV DM annihilation.</description>

      <title>On the structure of trans-series in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many observables in quantum field theory can be expressed in terms of trans-series, in which one adds to the perturbative series a typically infinite sum of exponentially small corrections, due to instantons or to renormalons. Even after Borel resummation of the series in the coupling constant, one has to sum this infinite series of small exponential corrections. It has been argued that this leads to a new divergence, which is sometimes called the divergence of the OPE. We show that, in some interesting examples in quantum field theory, the series of small exponential corrections is convergent, order by order in the coupling constant. In particular, we give numerical evidence for this convergence property in the case of the free energy of integrable asymptotically free theories, which has been intensively studied recently in the framework of resurgence. Our results indicate that, in these examples, the Borel resummed trans-series leads to a well defined function, and there are no further divergences.</description>

      <title>One-loop vacuum energy in 10D super-Yang-Mills theory on magnetized tori with/without 4D N=1 supersymmetric completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop vacuum energy in 10 dimensional (10D) super Yang-Mills theory compactified on $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times (\mathbb{T}^2)^3$ in the presence of the Abelian magnetic fluxes. The regularization of infinite Kaluza-Klein (KK) sum is achieved by the use of Barnes $\zeta$-functions, which can be applied to the case with Landau level structure of KK mass spectrum. We apply the technique to two different models of the 10D super Yang-Mills theory: The one is to introduce the magnetic flux background to the 10D super Yang-Mills action. The other is to first embed 10D super Yang-Mills action into 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ superspace and to introduce magnetic fluxes. The two model buildings result in tree level potential. The KK mass spectrum of two models look different and we compute the one-loop vacuum energy of each case. Nevertheless, both of the KK mass spectra have the Landau level structure and we can apply the regularization method in the same way. We show that despite the differences the resultant one-loop vacuum energy of both models coincide with each other.</description>

      <title>False Vacuum Decay Rate From Thin To Thick Walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a single real scalar field in flat spacetime with a polynomial potential up to $\phi^4$, that has a local minimum, the false vacuum, and a deeper global minimum, the true vacuum. When the vacua are almost degenerate we are in the thin wall regime, while as their difference in potential energy increases, we approach the thick wall regime. We give explicit simple formulae for the decay rate of the false vacuum in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions. Our results include a careful treatment both of the bounce action, which enters at the exponent of the decay rate, and of the functional determinant at one loop, which determines the prefactor. The bounce action is computed analytically as an expansion in the thin wall parameter in generic $D$ dimensions. We find that truncating such an expansion at second order we obtain a remarkably accurate bounce action also deep into thick wall regimes. We calculate the functional determinant numerically in 3 and 4 dimensions and fit the results with simple polynomials of the same thin wall parameter. This allows us to write the complete one-loop decay rate as a compact expression, which works accurately from thin to thick wall regimes.</description>

Abstract: Recently, interest in quantum computing has significantly increased, driven by its potential advantages over classical techniques. Quantum machine learning (QML) exemplifies one of the important quantum computing applications that are expected to surpass classical machine learning in a wide range of instances. This paper addresses the performance of QML in the context of high-energy physics (HEP). As an example, we focus on the top-quark tagging, for which classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been effective but fall short in accuracy when dealing with highly energetic jet images. In this paper, we use a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for this task and compare its performance with CNN using a classical noiseless simulator. We compare various setups for the QCNN, varying the convolutional circuit, type of encoding, loss function, and batch sizes. For every quantum setup, we design a similar setup to the corresponding classical model for a fair comparison. Our results indicate that QCNN with proper setups tend to perform better than their CNN counterparts, particularly when the convolution block has a lower number of parameters. For the higher parameter regime, the QCNN circuit was adjusted according to the dimensional expressivity analysis (DEA) to lower the parameter count while preserving its optimal structure. The DEA circuit demonstrated improved results over the comparable classical CNN model.</description>

      <title>An Impact of Parton Distribution Functions on Open Heavy Flavor Azimuthal Angular Correlations in Pb-Pb Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of modern free parton distribution functions and nuclear parton distribution functions on the azimuthal angular correlation of open heavy flavor hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV using PYTHIA8 + Angantyr model. The method involves a transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) differential assessment of azimuthal angular correlations between prompt $\rm{D^0-\bar{D}^0}$ and $\rm{B-\bar{B}}$. By analyzing the $p_{\rm{T}}$-dependent behavior of these correlations, we probe the interplay between different production mechanisms and assess the impact of parton distribution functions on heavy-flavor hadron production dynamics. Our results indicate that nuclear parton distribution functions significantly modify both near-side and away-side peaks of the azimuthal correlation distribution compared to the default PYTHIA8 baseline, particularly at low $p_{\rm{T}}$. The near-side double-peak structure suggests contributions from next-to-leading order (NLO) processes, such as gluon splitting, and its presence is strongly correlated with the number of hard multi-partonic interactions. Additionally, by quantitatively comparing the change in correlation widths across various PDF settings, we comment on the role of nuclear parton distribution functions in heavy-quark thermalization in heavy-ion collisions. This comprehensive study of azimuthal correlations enhances our understanding of initial-state conditions and heavy-flavor production dynamics in nuclear collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study (multi) fermion - monopole bound states, many of which are the states that dyons adiabatically transition into as fermions become light. The properties of these bound states depend critically on the UV symmetries preserved by the fermion mass terms, their relative size, and the value of $\theta$. Depending on the relative size of the mass terms and the value of $\theta$, the bound states can undergo phase transitions as well as transition from being stable to unstable. In some simple situations, the bound state solution can be related to the Witten effect of another theory with fewer fermions and larger gauge coupling. These bound states are a result of mass terms and symmetry breaking boundary conditions at the monopole core and, consequently, these bound states do not necessarily have definite quantum numbers under accidental IR symmetries. Additionally, they have binding energies that are $\mathcal{O}(1)$ times the fermion mass and bound state radii of order their inverse mass. As the massless limit is approached, the bound state radii approach infinity, and they become new asymptotic states with odd quantum numbers giving a dynamical understanding to the origin of semitons.</description>

Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons on a Bose-Einstein condensate has been explored in (Phys. Rev. D 110 (2024) 026014; https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.026014). In the previous paper, we investigated the effects of graviton while detecting a gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this work we shall explicitly calculate the decoherence due to the noise of gravitons between two momentum states of the Bose-Einstein condensate. This decoherence happens due to Bremsstrahlung from the Bose-Einstein condensates due to the effect of the noise induced by gravitons. It is also observed that the two states become entangled because of the existence of a surrounding graviton field which degrades over time via means of this gravitational Bremsstrahlung. Using this property of the Bose-Einstein condensate in a quantum gravity background, we propose an experimental test via the use of atom lasers (generated from the condensate) which would, in principle, help to detect gravitons in future generations of very advanced ultra-cold temperature experiments.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition: effective field theory and holography</title>

Abstract: We consider the chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but with vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low-energy effective field theory for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the effective field theory, we briefly discuss the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scenario based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics: Thermodynamic constraints on a generalized cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first and second laws of thermodynamics should lead to a consistent scenario for discussing the cosmological constant problem. In the present study, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the first law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then, the cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that includes two extra driving terms, $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$, which are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk viscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the two terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is found that a deviation $S_{\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain the upper limits of $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late Universe. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In particular, when the deviation $S_{\Delta}$ is close to zero, $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant value (consistent with the order of $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as if a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Effects of spacetime geometry on neutrino oscillation inside a Core-Collapse Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are excellent probes of the inner structures of supernovas. However, an understanding of their dynamics remains incomplete, which is crucial for properly interpreting the detector data. The huge matter density inside a core collapse supernova affects the self-coupling of the neutrinos through a geometrical four-fermion interaction induced by spacetime torsion generated by the fermions themselves. For normal mass hierarchy, the effect is negligible; for inverted mass hierarchy however, we find that the gravitational coupling can significantly alter the flavor dynamics. The possibility of constraining the said interactions through the relative abundance of different flavors of the neutrinos is discussed.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Structure of Loop Amplitudes and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the self-similar structure of loop amplitudes in quantum field theory and apply it to amplitude generation and renormalization. A renormalized amplitude can be regarded as an effective coupling that recursively appears within another loop. It is best described as a coupling in the effective action. It is a scale-dependent, finite, parametrically small and observable quantity appearing in the S-matrix. Replacing a tree-level coupling with a loop amplitude provides a systematic method of generating high-order loop amplitudes, guaranteeing no subamplitude divergence. This method also provides an alternative bottom-up proof and improvement to the traditional top-down recursive renormalization of general amplitudes.</description>
