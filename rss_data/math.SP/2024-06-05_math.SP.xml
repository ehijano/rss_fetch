      <title>On a conjecture of a P\'olya functional for triangles and rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the functional given by the product of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and the torsional rigidity of planar domains normalized by the area. This scale invariant functional was studied by P\'olya and Szeg\H{o} in 1951 who showed that it is bounded above by 1 for all domains. It has been conjectured that within the class of bounded convex planar domains the functional is bounded below by $\pi^{2}/24$ and above by $\pi^{2}/12$ and that these bounds are sharp. Remarkably, the conjecture remains open even within the class of triangles. The purpose of this paper is to prove the conjecture in this case. The conjecture is also proved for rectangles where a stronger monotonicity property is verified. Finally, the upper bound also holds for tangential quadrilateral.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Formula for Eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian in Domains with a Small Star-shaped Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates a spectral problem of the Laplace operator in a two-dimensional bounded domain perforated by a small arbitrary star-shaped hole and on the smooth boundary of which the Neumann boundary condition is imposed. It is proved that the eigenvalues of this problem converge to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian defined on the unperturbed domain as the size of the hole approaches zero. Furthermore, our main theorem provides the rate of convergence by showing an asymptotic expansion for all simple eigenvalues with respect to the size and shape of the hole.</description>

      <title>Universality arising from invertible weighted composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear operator $U$ acting boundedly on an infinite-dimensional separable complex Hilbert space $H$ is universal if every linear bounded operator acting on $H$ is similar to a scalar multiple of a restriction of $U$ to one of its invariant subspaces. It turns out that characterizing the lattice of closed invariant subspaces of a universal operator is equivalent to solve the Invariant Subspace Problem for Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we consider invertible weighted hyperbolic composition operators and we prove the universality of the translations by eigenvalues of such operators, acting on Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces. Some consequences for the Banach space case are also discussed.</description>
