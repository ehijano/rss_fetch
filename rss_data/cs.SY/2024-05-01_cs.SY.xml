      <title>Adaptive Regulated Sparsity Promoting Approach for Data-Driven Modeling and Control of Grid-Connected Solar Photovoltaic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to introduce a new statistical learning technique based on sparsity promoting for data-driven modeling and control of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Compared with conventional sparse regression techniques that might introduce computational complexities when the number of candidate functions increases, an innovative algorithm, named adaptive regulated sparse regression (ARSR) is proposed that adaptively regulates the hyperparameter weights of candidate functions to best represent the dynamics of PV systems. Utilizing this algorithm, open-loop and closed-loop models of single-stage and two-stage PV systems are obtained from measurements and are utilized for control design purposes. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed data-driven approach can successfully be employed for fault analysis studies, which distinguishes its capabilities compared with other data-driven techniques. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through real-time simulations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Min-Max MPC for Linear Systems: Robustness and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven controllers design is an important research problem, in particular when data is corrupted by the noise. In this paper, we propose a data-driven min-max model predictive control (MPC) scheme using noisy input-state data for unknown linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The unknown system matrices are characterized by a set-membership representation using the noisy input-state data. Leveraging this representation, we derive an upper bound on the worst-case cost and determine the corresponding optimal state-feedback control law through a semidefinite program (SDP). We prove that the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stabilized and satisfies the input and state constraints. Further, we propose an adaptive data-driven min-max MPC scheme which exploits additional online input-state data to improve closed-loop performance. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Assessing the safety benefits of CACC+ based coordination of connected and autonomous vehicle platoons in emergency braking scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety is the most important factor in connected and autonomous vehicles, especially in emergency braking situations. As such, assessing the safety benefits of one information topology over other is a necessary step towards evaluating and ensuring safety. In this paper, we compare the safety benefits of a cooperative adaptive cruise control which utilizes information from one predecessor vehicle (CACC) with the one that utilizes information from multiple predecessors (CACC+) for the maintenance of spacing under an emergency braking scenario. A constant time headway policy is employed for maintenance of spacing (that includes a desired standstill spacing distance and a velocity dependent spacing distance) between the vehicles in the platoon. The considered emergency braking scenario consists of braking of the leader vehicle of the platoon at its maximum deceleration and that of the following vehicles to maintain the spacing as per CACC or CACC+. By focusing on the standstill spacing distance and utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the safety benefits of CACC+ over CACC by utilizing the following safety metrics: (1) probability of collision, (2) expected number of collisions, and (3) severity of collision (defined as the relative velocity of the two vehicles at impact). We present and provide discussion of these results.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Thermal Performance of a Wick-free Vapor Chamber in Power Electronics Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient thermal management in high-power electronics cooling can be achieved using phase-change heat transfer devices, such as vapor chambers. Traditional vapor chambers use wicks to transport condensate for efficient thermal exchange and to prevent "dry-out" of the evaporator. However, wicks in vapor chambers present significant design challenges arising out of large pressure drops across the wicking material, which slows down condensate transport rates and increases the chances for dry-out. Thicker wicks add to overall thermal resistance, while deterring the development of thinner devices by limiting the total thickness of the vapor chamber. Wickless vapor chambers eliminate the use of metal wicks entirely, by incorporating complementary wettability-patterned flat plates on both the evaporator and the condenser side. Such surface modifications enhance fluid transport on the evaporator side, while allowing the chambers to be virtually as thin as imaginable, thereby permitting design of thermally efficient thin electronic cooling devices. While wick-free vapor chambers have been studied and efficient design strategies have been suggested, we delve into real-life applications of wick-free vapor chambers in forced air cooling of high-power electronics. An experimental setup is developed wherein two Si-based MOSFETs of TO-247-3 packaging having high conduction resistance, are connected in parallel and switched at 100 kHz, to emulate high frequency power electronics operations. A rectangular copper wick-free vapor chamber spreads heat laterally over a surface 13 times larger than the heating area. This chamber is cooled externally by a fan that circulates air at room temperature. The present experimental setup extends our previous work on wick-free vapor chambers, while demonstrating the effectiveness of low-cost air cooling in vapor-chamber enhanced high-power electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Temporal Logic Resilience for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the notion of resilience for cyber-physical systems, that is, the ability of the system to withstand adverse events while maintaining acceptable functionality. We use finite temporal logic to express the requirements on the acceptable functionality and define the resilience metric as the maximum disturbance under which the system satisfies the temporal requirements. We fix a parameterized template for the set of disturbances and form a robust optimization problem under the system dynamics and the temporal specifications to find the maximum value of the parameter. Additionally, we introduce two novel classes of specifications: closed and convex finite temporal logics specifications, offering a comprehensive analysis of the resilience metric within these specific frameworks. From a computational standpoint, we present an exact solution for linear systems and exact-time reachability and finite-horizon safety, complemented by an approximate solution for finite-horizon reachability. Extending our findings to nonlinear systems, we leverage linear approximations and SMT-based approaches to offer viable computational methodologies. The theoretical results are demonstrated on the temperature regulation of buildings, adaptive cruise control and DC motors.</description>

      <title>mm-Wave and sub-THz Chip-to-Package Transitions for Communications Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents mm-Wave and sub-THz chip-to-package transitions for communications systems. To date, reported transitions either have high loss, typically 3 to 4 dB, or require high cost packages to support very fine bump pitches and low loss materials. We analyze the impact of transitions on a high frequency, wide bandwidth communication system and present the design of a chip-to-package transition in two different commercial packaging technologies. The proposed transitions achieve &lt;1 dB loss in both technologies, validating the design methodology.</description>

      <title>A Concept for Semi-Automatic Configuration of Sufficiently Valid Simulation Setups for Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As simulation is increasingly used in scenario-based approaches to test Automated Driving Systems, the credibility of simulation results is a major concern. Arguably, credibility depends on the validity of the simulation setup and simulation models. When selecting appropriate simulation models, a trade-off must be made between validity, often connected to the model's fidelity, and cost of computation. However, due to the large number of test cases, expert-based methods to create sufficiently valid simulation setups seem infeasible. We propose using design contracts in order to semi-automatically compose simulation setups for given test cases from simulation models and to derive requirements for the simulation models, supporting separation of concerns between simulation model developers and users. Simulation model contracts represent their validity domains by capturing a validity guarantee and the associated operating conditions in an assumption. We then require the composition of the simulation model contracts to refine a test case contract. The latter contract captures the operating conditions of the test case in its assumption and validity requirements in its guarantee. Based on this idea, we present a framework that supports the compositional configuration of simulation setups based on the contracts and a method to derive runtime monitors for these simulation setups.</description>

      <title>Online Electricity Purchase for Data Center with Dynamic Virtual Battery from Flexibility Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a critical component of modern infrastructure, data centers account for a huge amount of power consumption and greenhouse gas emission. This paper studies the electricity purchase strategy for a data center to lower its energy cost while integrating local renewable generation under uncertainty. To facilitate efficient and scalable decision-making, we propose a two-layer hierarchy where the lower layer consists of the operation of all electrical equipment in the data center and the upper layer determines the procurement and dispatch of electricity. At the lower layer, instead of device-level scheduling in real time, we propose to exploit the inherent flexibility in demand, such as thermostatically controlled loads and flexible computing tasks, and aggregate them into virtual batteries. By this means, the upper-layer decision only needs to take into account these virtual batteries, the size of which is generally small and independent of the data center scale. We further propose an online algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization to purchase electricity from the grid with a manageable energy cost, even though the prices, renewable availability, and battery specifications are uncertain and dynamic. In particular, we show that, under mild conditions, our algorithm can achieve bounded loss compared with the offline optimal cost, while strictly respecting battery operational constraints. Extensive simulation studies validate the theoretical analysis and illustrate the tradeoff between optimality and conservativeness.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Robust Planning Model for Park-Level Integrated Energy System Considering Uncertain Equipment Contingency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage robust planning model for an Integrated Energy System (IES) that serves an industrial park. The term 'Park-level IES' is used to refers to IES of a smaller scale but have high demands for various forms of energy. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a novel and modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed models over the deterministic planning model in terms of improving reliability.</description>

      <title>Passivation of Clustered DC Microgrids with Non-Monotone Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of voltage stability in DC networks containing uncertain loads with non-monotone incremental impedances and where the steady-state power availability is restricted to a subset of the buses in the network. We propose controllers for powered buses that guarantee voltage regulation and output strictly equilibrium independent passivity (OS-EIP) of the controlled buses, while buses without power are equipped with controllers that dampen their transient behaviour. The OS-EIP of a cluster containing both bus types is verified through a linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition, and the asymptotic stability of the overall microgrid with uncertain, non-monotone loads is ensured by interconnecting the OS-EIP clusters. By further employing singular perturbation theory, we show that the OS-EIP property of the clusters is robust against certain network parameter and topology changes.</description>

      <title>Distributed Traffic Signal Control via Coordinated Maximum Pressure-plus-Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an adaptive traffic control policy inspired by Maximum Pressure (MP) while imposing coordination across intersections. The proposed Coordinated Maximum Pressure-plus-Penalty (CMPP) control policy features a local objective for each intersection that consists of the total pressure within the neighborhood and a penalty accounting for the queue capacities and continuous green time for certain movements. The corresponding control task is reformulated as a distributed optimization problem and solved via two customized algorithms: one based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the other follows a greedy heuristic augmented with a majority vote. CMPP not only provides a theoretical guarantee of queuing network stability but also outperforms several benchmark controllers in simulations on a large-scale real traffic network with lower average travel and waiting time per vehicle, as well as less network congestion. Furthermore, CPMM with the greedy algorithm enjoys comparable computational efficiency as fully decentralized controllers without significantly compromising the control performance, which highlights its great potential for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Consensus + Innovations Approach for Online Distributed Multi-Area Inertia Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduction of overall system inertia in modern power systems due to the increasing deployment of distributed energy resources is generally recognized as a major issue for system stability. Consequently, real-time monitoring of system inertia is critical to ensure a reliable and cost-effective system operation. Large-scale power systems are typically managed by multiple transmission system operators, making it difficult to have a central entity with access to global measurement data, which is usually required for estimating the overall system inertia. We address this problem by proposing a fully distributed inertia estimation algorithm with rigorous analytical convergence guarantees. This method requires only peer-to-peer sharing of local parameter estimates between neighboring control areas, eliminating the need for a centralized collection of real-time measurements. We robustify the algorithm in the presence of typical power system disturbances and demonstrate its performance in simulations based on the well-known New England IEEE-39 bus system.</description>

      <title>Dual-Port Grid-Forming Interconnecting Power Converters in Hybrid AC/DC Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interconnecting power converters (IPC) are the main elements enabling the interconnection of multiple high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) subgrids. These converters can be classified either as grid-forming or grid-following. These roles can be assigned to both ac and dc terminals. This work compares state-of-the-art single-port grid-forming and grid-following control schemes with a dual-port grid-forming control scheme, which can simultaneously form a stable voltage on the ac and the dc sides. The dual-port grid-forming small-signal stability and dynamic behavior under fluctuations in the power flow are studied and compared against state-of-the-art control architectures. Moreover, the dual-port control scheme is validated and tested on a down-scaled laboratory platform with several transient events.</description>

      <title>Impact of whole-body vibrations on electrovibration perception varies with target stimulus duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of whole-body vibrations induced by external vehicle perturbations, such as aircraft turbulence, on the perception of electrovibration displayed on touchscreens. Electrovibration holds promise as a technology for providing tactile feedback on future touchscreens, addressing usability challenges in vehicle cockpits. However, its performance under dynamic conditions, such as during whole-body vibrations induced by turbulence, still needs to be explored. We measured the absolute detection thresholds of 15 human participants for short- and long-duration electrovibration stimuli displayed on a touchscreen, both in the absence and presence of two types of turbulence motion generated by a motion simulator. Concurrently, we measured participants' applied contact force and finger scan speeds. Significantly higher (38%) absolute detection thresholds were observed for short electrovibration stimuli than for long stimuli. Finger scan speeds in the direction of turbulence, applied forces, and force fluctuation rates increased during whole-body vibrations due to biodynamic feedthrough. As a result, turbulence also significantly increased the perception thresholds, but only for short-duration electrovibration stimuli. The results reveal that whole-body vibrations can impede the perception of short-duration electrovibration stimuli, due to involuntary finger movements and increased normal force fluctuations. Our findings offer valuable insights for the future design of touchscreens with tactile feedback in vehicle cockpits.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Advanced Longitudinal Control and Collision Avoidance in High-Risk Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems primarily focus on the vehicle directly ahead, often overlooking potential risks from following vehicles. This oversight can lead to ineffective handling of high risk situations, such as high speed, closely spaced, multi vehicle scenarios where emergency braking by one vehicle might trigger a pile up collision. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning based algorithm for longitudinal control and collision avoidance. This proposed algorithm effectively considers the behavior of both leading and following vehicles. Its implementation in simulated high risk scenarios, which involve emergency braking in dense traffic where traditional systems typically fail, has demonstrated the algorithm ability to prevent potential pile up collisions, including those involving heavy duty vehicles.</description>

      <title>Thermal Performance of a Liquid-cooling Assisted Thin Wickless Vapor Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing need for power consumption in electronic devices, coupled with the requirement for thinner size, calls for the development of efficient heat spreading components. Vapor chambers (VCs), because of their ability to effectively spread heat over a large area by two-phase heat transfer, seem ideal for such applications. However, creating thin and efficient vapor chambers that work over a wide range of power inputs is a persisting challenge. VCs that use wicks for circulating the phase changing media, suffer from capillary restrictions, dry-out, clogging, increase in size and weight, and can often be costly. Recent developments in wick-free wettability patterned vapor chambers replace traditional wicks with laser-fabricated wickless components. An experimental setup allows for fast testing and experimental evaluation of water-charged VCs with liquid-assisted cooling. The sealed chamber can maintain vacuum for long durations, and can be used for testing of very thin wick-free VCs. This work extends our previous study by decreasing overall thickness of the wick-free VC down to 3 mm and evaluates its performance. Furthermore, the impact of wettability patterns on VC performance is investigated, by carrying out experiments both in non-patterned and patterned VCs. Experiments are first carried out on a wick-free VC with no wettability patterns and comprising of an entirely superhydrophilic evaporator coupled with a hydrophobic condenser. Thereafter, wettability patterns that aid the rapid return of water to the heated site on the evaporator and improve condensation on the condenser of the vapor chamber are implemented. The thermal characteristics show that the patterned VCs outperform the non-patterned VCs under all scenarios. The patterned VCs exhibit low thermal resistance independent of fluid charging ratio withstanding higher power inputs without thermal dry-outs.</description>

      <title>Periodic Event-Triggered Boundary Control of Neuron Growth with Actuation at Soma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring novel strategies for the regulation of axon growth, we introduce a periodic event-triggered control (PETC) to enhance the practical implementation of the associated PDE backstepping control law. Neurological injuries may impair neuronal function, but therapies like Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) have shown promise in improving axon elongation by influencing the extracellular matrix. This matrix, composed of extracellular macromolecules and minerals, regulates tubulin protein concentration, potentially aiding in neuronal recovery. The concentration and spatial distribution of tubulin influence axon elongation dynamics. Recent research explores feedback control strategies for this model, leading to the development of an event-triggering control (CETC) approach. In this approach, the control law updates when the monitored triggering condition is met, reducing actuation resource consumption. Through the meticulous redesign of the triggering mechanism, we introduce a periodic event-triggering control (PETC), updating control inputs at specific intervals, but evaluating the event-trigger only periodically, an ideal tool for standard time-sliced actuators like ChABC. PETC is a step forward to the design of practically feasible feedback laws for the neuron growth process. The PETC strategy establishes an upper bound on event triggers between periodic examinations, ensuring convergence and preventing Zeno behavior. Through Lyapunov analysis, we demonstrate the local exponential convergence of the system with the periodic event-triggering mechanism in the $L^2$-norm sense. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Bounded Rationality in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nash equilibrium is a common solution concept that captures the strategic interaction in electricity market analysis. However, it requires a fundamental but impractical assumption that all market participants are fully rational, which implies unlimited computational resources and cognitive abilities. To tackle the limitation, level-k reasoning is proposed and studied to model the bounded rational behaviors. In this paper, we consider a Cournot competition in electricity markets with two suppliers both following level-k reasoning. One is a self-interested firm and the other serves as a benevolent social planner. First, we observe that the optimal strategy of the social planner is to be of a particular rationality level. Being less or more rational may both result in reduced social welfare. Then, we investigate the effect of bounded rationality on social welfare performance and find that it could largely deviate from that at the Nash equilibrium point. Finally, we characterize optimal, mean maximizing and max-min strategies for the benevolent social planner, when having access to different information. The numerical experiments further demonstrate and validate our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling quantum systems under correlated non-Markovian noise, particularly when strongly coupled, poses significant challenges in the development of quantum technologies. Traditional quantum control strategies, heavily reliant on precise models, often fail under these conditions. Here, we address the problem by utilizing a data-driven graybox model, which integrates machine learning structures with physics-based elements. We demonstrate single-qubit control, implementing a universal gate set as well as a random gate set, achieving high fidelity under unknown, strongly-coupled non-Markovian non-Gaussian noise, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Our method is applicable to all open finite-dimensional quantum systems, regardless of the type of noise or the strength of the coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compare two numerical methods to integrate Riemannian cubic polynomials on the Stiefel manifold $\textbf{St}_{n,k}$. The first one is the adjusted de Casteljau algorithm, and the second one is a symplectic integrator constructed through discretization maps. In particular, we choose the cases of $n=3$ together with $k=1$ and $k=2$. The first case is diffeomorphic to the sphere and the quasi-geodesics appearing in the adjusted de Casteljau algorithm are actually geodesics. The second case is an example where we have a pure quasi-geodesic different from a geodesic. We provide a numerical comparison of both methods and discuss the obtained results to highlight the benefits of each method.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robotic Adaptability: Integrating Unsupervised Trajectory Segmentation and Conditional ProMPs for Dynamic Learning Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for enhancing robotic adaptability and learning efficiency, which integrates unsupervised trajectory segmentation with adaptive probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs). By employing a cutting-edge deep learning architecture that combines autoencoders and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), our approach autonomously pinpoints critical transitional points in continuous, unlabeled motion data, thus significantly reducing dependence on extensively labeled datasets. This innovative method dynamically adjusts motion trajectories using conditional variables, significantly enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of robotic actions under dynamic conditions while also reducing the computational overhead associated with traditional robotic programming methods. Our experimental validation demonstrates superior learning efficiency and adaptability compared to existing techniques, paving the way for advanced applications in industrial and service robotics.</description>

      <title>Reactive Temporal Logic-based Planning and Control for Interactive Robotic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots interacting with humans must be safe, reactive and adapt online to unforeseen environmental and task changes. Achieving these requirements concurrently is a challenge as interactive planners lack formal safety guarantees, while safe motion planners lack flexibility to adapt. To tackle this, we propose a modular control architecture that generates both safe and reactive motion plans for human-robot interaction by integrating temporal logic-based discrete task level plans with continuous Dynamical System (DS)-based motion plans. We formulate a reactive temporal logic formula that enables users to define task specifications through structured language, and propose a planning algorithm at the task level that generates a sequence of desired robot behaviors while being adaptive to environmental changes. At the motion level, we incorporate control Lyapunov functions and control barrier functions to compute stable and safe continuous motion plans for two types of robot behaviors: (i) complex, possibly periodic motions given by autonomous DS and (ii) time-critical tasks specified by Signal Temporal Logic~(STL). Our methodology is demonstrated on the Franka robot arm performing wiping tasks on a whiteboard and a mannequin that is compliant to human interactions and adaptive to environmental changes.</description>

      <title>Time- versus event-triggered consensus of a single-integrator multi-agent system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-triggered control has shown the potential for providing improved control performance at the same average sampling rate when compared to time-triggered control. While this observation motivates numerous event-triggered control schemes, proving it from a theoretical perspective has only been achieved for a limited number of settings. Inspired by existing performance analyses for the single-loop case, we provide a first fundamental performance comparison of time- and event-triggered control in a multi-agent consensus setting. For this purpose, we consider undirected connected network topologies without communication delays, a level-triggering rule for event-triggered control, and the long-term average of the quadratic deviation from consensus as a performance measure. The main finding of our analysis is that time-triggered control provably outperforms event-triggered control beyond a certain number of agents in our particular setting. We thereby provide an illustrative distributed problem setup in which event-triggered control results in a performance disadvantage when compared to time-triggered control in the case of large networks. Moreover, we derive the asymptotic order of the performance measure under both triggering schemes which gives more insights into the cost relationship for large numbers of agents. Thus, by presenting an analysis for a particular setup, this work points out that transferring an event-triggering scheme from the single-loop to the multi-agent setting can lead to a loss of the often presumed superiority of event-triggered control over time-triggered control. In particular, the design of performant decentralized event-triggering schemes can therefore pose additional challenges when compared to the analogue single-loop case.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Procrastination Policy for EV charging under Net Energy Metering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of behind-the-meter EV charging by a prosumer, co-optimized with rooftop solar, electric battery, and flexible consumptions such as water heaters and HVAC. Under the time-of-use net energy metering tariff with the stochastic solar production and random EV charging demand, a finite-horizon surplus-maximization problem is formulated. We show that a procrastination threshold policy that delays EV charging to the last possible moment is optimal when EV charging is co-optimized with flexible demand, and the policy thresholds can be computed easily offline. When battery storage is part of the co-optimization, it is shown that the net consumption of the prosumer is a two-threshold piecewise linear function of the behind-the-meter renewable generation under the optimal policy, and the procrastination threshold policy remains optimal, although the thresholds cannot be computed easily. We propose a simple myopic solution and demonstrate in simulations that the performance gap between the myopic policy and an oracle upper bound appears to be 0.5-7.5%.</description>

      <title>Towards Energysheds: A Technical Definition and Cooperative Framework for Future Power System Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how interactions between system-wide objectives and local community decision-making will impact the clean energy transition. The concept of energysheds has gained traction in the areas of public policy and social science as a way to study these relationships. However, development of technical definitions of energysheds that permit system analysis are still largely missing. In this work, we propose a mathematical definition for energysheds, and introduce an analytical framework for studying energyshed concepts within the context of future electric power system operations. This framework is used to develop insights into the factors that impact a community's ability to achieve energyshed policy incentives within a larger connected power grid, as well as the tradeoffs associated with different spatial policy requirements. We also propose an optimization-based energyshed policy design problem, and show that it can be solved to global optimality within arbitrary precision by employing concepts from quasi-convex optimization. Finally, we investigate how interconnected energysheds can cooperatively achieve their objectives in bulk power system operations.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Observer Design for the Discrete-time Systems: Exploiting Matrix-Multiplier-based LMI Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter focuses on the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ observer design for a class of nonlinear discrete systems under the presence of measurement noise or external disturbances. A novel Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) condition is developed in this method through the utilisation of the reformulated Lipschitz property, a new variant of Young inequality and the well-known Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) approach. One of the key components of the proposed LMI is the generalised matrix multipliers. The deliberate use of these multipliers enables us to introduce more numbers of decision variables inside LMIs than the one illustrated in the literature. It aids in adding some extra degrees of freedom from a feasibility point of view, thus enhancing the LMI conditions. Thus, the proposed LMIs are less conservative than existing ones. Later on, the effectiveness of the developed LMIs and observer is highlighted through the numerical example and an application of state of charge (SoC) estimation in the Li-ion battery model.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the risk-aware control of stochastic systems with temporal logic specifications dynamically assigned during runtime. Conventional risk-aware control typically assumes that all specifications are predefined and remain unchanged during runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel, provably correct model predictive control scheme for linear systems with additive unbounded stochastic disturbances that dynamically evaluates the feasibility of runtime signal temporal logic specifications and automatically reschedules the control inputs accordingly. The control method guarantees the probabilistic satisfaction of newly accepted specifications without sacrificing the satisfaction of the previously accepted ones. The proposed control method is validated by a robotic motion planning case study.</description>

      <title>Control Policy Correction Framework for Reinforcement Learning-based Energy Arbitrage Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A continuous rise in the penetration of renewable energy sources, along with the use of the single imbalance pricing, provides a new opportunity for balance responsible parties to reduce their cost through energy arbitrage in the imbalance settlement mechanism. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods are an appropriate choice for solving the energy arbitrage problem due to their outstanding performance in solving complex stochastic sequential problems. However, RL is rarely deployed in real-world applications since its learned policy does not necessarily guarantee safety during the execution phase. In this paper, we propose a new RL-based control framework for batteries to obtain a safe energy arbitrage strategy in the imbalance settlement mechanism. In our proposed control framework, the agent initially aims to optimize the arbitrage revenue. Subsequently, in the post-processing step, we correct (constrain) the learned policy following a knowledge distillation process based on properties that follow human intuition. Our post-processing step is a generic method and is not restricted to the energy arbitrage domain. We use the Belgian imbalance price of 2023 to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework. Furthermore, we deploy our proposed control framework on a real battery to show its capability in the real world.</description>

      <title>A sparse ADMM-based solver for linear MPC subject to terminal quadratic constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.08419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) typically includes a terminal constraint to guarantee stability of the closed-loop system under nominal conditions. In linear MPC this constraint is generally taken on a polyhedral set, leading to a quadratic optimization problem. However, the use of an ellipsoidal terminal constraint may be desirable, leading to an optimization problem with a quadratic constraint. In this case, the optimization problem can be solved using Second Order Cone (SOC) programming solvers, since the quadratic constraint can be posed as a SOC constraint, at the expense of adding additional slack variables and possibly compromising the simple structure of the solver ingredients. In this paper we present a sparse solver for linear MPC subject to a terminal ellipsoidal constraint based on the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm in which we directly deal with the quadratic constraints without having to resort to the use of a SOC constraint nor the inclusion of additional decision variables. The solver is suitable for its use in embedded systems, since it is sparse, has a small memory footprint and requires no external libraries. We compare its performance against other approaches from the literature.</description>

      <title>Comparisons of two-stage models for flood mitigation of electrical substations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12872v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare stochastic programming and robust optimization decision models for informing the deployment of ad hoc flood mitigation measures to protect electrical substations prior to an imminent and uncertain hurricane. In our models, the first stage captures the deployment of a fixed quantity of flood mitigation resources, and the second stage captures the operation of a potentially degraded power grid with the primary goal of minimizing load shed. To model grid operation, we introduce adaptations of the DC and LPAC power flow approximation models that feature relatively complete recourse by way of an indicator variable. We apply our models to a pair of geographically realistic flooding case studies, one based on Hurricane Harvey and the other on Tropical Storm Imelda. We investigate the effect of the mitigation budget, the choice of power flow model, and the uncertainty perspective on the optimal mitigation strategy. Our results indicate the mitigation budget and uncertainty perspective are impactful whereas choosing between the DC and LPAC power flow models is of little to no consequence. To validate our models, we assess the performance of the mitigation solutions they prescribe in an AC power flow model.</description>

Abstract: The unprecedented rapid growth of computing demand for AI is projected to increase global annual datacenter (DC) growth from 7.2% to 11.3%. We project the 5-year AI DC demand for several power grids and assess whether they will allow desired AI growth (resource adequacy). If not, several "desperate measures" -- grid policies that enable more load growth and maintain grid reliability by sacrificing new DC reliability are considered.
  We find that two DC hotspots -- EirGrid (Ireland) and Dominion (US) -- will have difficulty accommodating new DCs needed by the AI growth. In EirGrid, relaxing new DC reliability guarantees increases the power available to 1.6x--4.1x while maintaining 99.6% actual power availability for the new DCs, sufficient for the 5-year AI demand. In Dominion, relaxing reliability guarantees increases available DC capacity similarly (1.5x--4.6x) but not enough for the 5-year AI demand. New DCs only receive 89% power availability. Study of other US power grids -- SPP, CAISO, ERCOT -- shows that sufficient capacity exists for the projected AI load growth.
  Our results suggest the need to rethink adequacy assessment and also grid planning and management. New research opportunities include coordinated planning, reliability models that incorporate load flexibility, and adaptive load abstractions.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Multi-stage Constellation Reconfiguration Using Integer Linear Programming and Sequential Decision-Making Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of reconfiguring Earth observation satellite constellation systems through multiple stages. The Multi-stage Constellation Reconfiguration Problem (MCRP) aims to maximize the total observation rewards obtained by covering a set of targets of interest through the active manipulation of the orbits and relative phasing of constituent satellites. In this paper, we consider deterministic problem settings in which the targets of interest are known a priori. We propose a novel integer linear programming formulation for MCRP, capable of obtaining provably optimal solutions. To overcome computational intractability due to the combinatorial explosion in solving large-scale instances, we introduce two computationally efficient sequential decision-making methods based on the principles of a myopic policy and a rolling horizon procedure. The computational experiments demonstrate that the devised sequential decision-making approaches yield high-quality solutions with improved computational efficiency over the baseline MCRP. Finally, a case study using Hurricane Harvey data showcases the advantages of multi-stage constellation reconfiguration over single-stage and no-reconfiguration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards a Systems Theory of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, numerical algorithms are seen as isolated pieces of code confined to an {\em in silico} existence. However, this perspective is not appropriate for many modern computational approaches in control, learning, or optimization, wherein {\em in vivo} algorithms interact with their environment. Examples of such {\em open algorithms} include various real-time optimization-based control strategies, reinforcement learning, decision-making architectures, online optimization, and many more. Further, even {\em closed} algorithms in learning or optimization are increasingly abstracted in block diagrams with interacting dynamic modules and pipelines. In this opinion paper, we state our vision on a to-be-cultivated {\em systems theory of algorithms} and argue in favor of viewing algorithms as open dynamical systems interacting with other algorithms, physical systems, humans, or databases. Remarkably, the manifold tools developed under the umbrella of systems theory are well suited for addressing a range of challenges in the algorithmic domain. We survey various instances where the principles of algorithmic systems theory are being developed and outline pertinent modeling, analysis, and design challenges.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-modal Model Predictive Control via Duality-based Interaction Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical architecture designed for scalable real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) in complex, multi-modal traffic scenarios. This architecture comprises two key components: 1) RAID-Net, a novel attention-based Recurrent Neural Network that predicts relevant interactions along the MPC prediction horizon between the autonomous vehicle and the surrounding vehicles using Lagrangian duality, and 2) a reduced Stochastic MPC problem that eliminates irrelevant collision avoidance constraints, enhancing computational efficiency. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated traffic intersection with interactive surrounding vehicles, showcasing a 12x speed-up in solving the motion planning problem. A video demonstrating the proposed architecture in multiple complex traffic scenarios can be found here: https://youtu.be/-pRiOnPb9_c.

      <title>Goal-Reaching Trajectory Design Near Danger with Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots must maintain safety, but should not sacrifice performance, leading to the classical reach-avoid problem. This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and to avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Traffic Incident Management with Large Language Models: A Hybrid Machine Learning Approach for Severity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research showcases the innovative integration of Large Language Models into machine learning workflows for traffic incident management, focusing on the classification of incident severity using accident reports. By leveraging features generated by modern language models alongside conventional data extracted from incident reports, our research demonstrates improvements in the accuracy of severity classification across several machine learning algorithms. Our contributions are threefold. First, we present an extensive comparison of various machine learning models paired with multiple large language models for feature extraction, aiming to identify the optimal combinations for accurate incident severity classification. Second, we contrast traditional feature engineering pipelines with those enhanced by language models, showcasing the superiority of language-based feature engineering in processing unstructured text. Third, our study illustrates how merging baseline features from accident reports with language-based features can improve the severity classification accuracy. This comprehensive approach not only advances the field of incident management but also highlights the cross-domain application potential of our methodology, particularly in contexts requiring the prediction of event outcomes from unstructured textual data or features translated into textual representation. Specifically, our novel methodology was applied to three distinct datasets originating from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Queensland, Australia. This cross-continental application underlines the robustness of our approach, suggesting its potential for widespread adoption in improving incident management processes globally.</description>
