      <title>Advancing Operational Efficiency: Airspace Users' Perspective on Trajectory-Based Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the evolution of the Flight Operations Center (FOC) and flight trajectory exchange tools within Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO), emphasizing the benefits of the ICAO's Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE) messaging framework and Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs). It highlights the collaborative management of four-dimensional flight trajectories, serving as a common reference for decision-making among stakeholders, including Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), airspace users, and airport operators.
  Key enabling technologies such as Performance Based Navigation (PBN), data communications, and System-wide Information Management (SWIM) are discussed, showcasing their roles in rapid information exchange and trajectory optimization. A live flight case study demonstrates TBO concepts through international collaboration, indicating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and sustainability.
  The paper presents results from TBO prototype implementations, including enhanced trajectory accuracy, improved flight path efficiency, and real-time adjustments based on evolving conditions. The integration of advanced trajectory optimization engines and automation within the FOC has led to more effective flight planning, allowing airlines to negotiate trajectory changes dynamically and optimize operations throughout the flight lifecycle.
  Findings suggest that TBO can enhance operational predictability, flexibility, and strategic planning while reducing uncertainty and improving alignment between strategic and tactical actions. Key conclusions include: TBO is feasible with most currently flying commercial aircraft; full TBO implementation can lead to a greener, more efficient aviation industry with widespread benefits; and continued collaboration among stakeholders is essential for the further development and realization of TBO.</description>

      <title>Development dilemma of ride-sharing: Revenue or social welfare?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the development dilemma of ride-sharing services using real-world mobility datasets from nine cities and calibrated customers' price and detour elasticity. Through massive numerical experiments, this study reveals that while ride-sharing can benefit social welfare, it may also lead to a loss of revenue for transportation network companies (TNCs) or drivers compared with solo-hailing, which limits TNCs' motivation to develop ride-sharing services. Three key factors contributing to this revenue loss are identified: (1) the low successful sharing ratio for customers choosing ride-sharing in some cases, (2) the limited saved trip distance by pooling two customers, and (3) the potential revenue loss when pooling customers with significantly different trip fares. Furthermore, this study finds that the monetary benefits of carbon emission reductions from ride-sharing are not substantial enough to affect customers' choices between solo-hailing and ride-sharing. The findings provide a valuable reference for TNCs and governments. For TNCs, effective pricing strategies, such as dynamic pricing, should be designed to prevent revenue loss when introducing ride-sharing. Governments are suggested to subsidize ride-sharing services to solve the development dilemma and maintain or even increase social welfare benefits from ride-sharing, including reduced carbon emissions and improved vehicle occupancy rates.</description>

      <title>Updated version "Robust Voltage Regulation of DC-DC Buck Converter With ZIP Load via An Energy Shaping Control Approach"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZIP loads (the parallel combination of constant impedance loads, constant current loads and constant power loads) exist widely in power system. In order to stabilize buck converter based DC distributed system with ZIP load, an adaptive energy shaping controller (AESC) is devised in this paper. Firstly, based on the assumption that lumped disturbances are known, a full information controller is designed in the framework of the port Hamiltonian system via energy shaping technique. Besides, using mathematical deductive method, an estimation of the domain of attraction is given to ensure the strict stability. Furthermore, to eliminate the influence of parameter perturbations on the system, a disturbance observer is proposed to reconstruct the lumped disturbances and then the estimated terms are introduced to above controller to form an AESC scheme. In addition, the stability analysis of the closed-loop system is given. Lastly, the simulation and experiment results are presented for assessing the designed controller.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning for Robust Stabilization of Linear Markov-Jumping Hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of robust stabilization for linear hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Markov-jumping parameter uncertainty. We consider a 2 x 2 heterogeneous hyperbolic PDE and propose a control law using operator learning and backstepping method. Specifically, the backstepping kernels used to construct the control law are approximated with neural operators (NOs) in order to improve computational efficiency. The key challenge lies in deriving the stability condition with respect to the Markov-jumping parameter uncertainty and NO approximation errors. The mean-square exponential stability of the stochastic system is achieved through Lyapunov analysis, indicating that the system can be stabilized if the random parameters are sufficiently close to the nominal parameters on average, and NO approximation errors are small enough. The theoretical results are applied to freeway traffic control under stochastic upstream demands and then validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Subspace tracking for online system identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an online approach for identifying time-varying subspaces defined by linear dynamical systems, leveraging optimization on the Grassmannian manifold leading to the Grassmannian Recursive Algorithm for Tracking (GREAT) method. The approach of representing linear systems by non-parametric subspace models has received significant interest in the field of data-driven control recently. We view subspaces as points on the Grassmannian manifold, and therefore, tracking is achieved by performing optimization on the manifold. At each time step, a single measurement from the current subspace corrupted by a bounded error is available. The subspace estimate is updated online using Grassmannian gradient descent on a cost function incorporating a window of the most recent data. Under suitable assumptions on the signal-to-noise ratio of the online data and the subspace's rate of change, we establish theoretical guarantees for the resulting algorithm. More specifically, we prove an exponential convergence rate and provide a consistent uncertainty quantification of the estimates in terms of an upper bound on their distance to the true subspace. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by means of numerical examples, and it is shown to compare favorably with competing parametric system identification methods.</description>

      <title>evS2CP: Real-time Simultaneous Speed and Charging Planner for Connected Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents evS2CP, an optimization-based framework for simultaneous speed and charging planning designed for connected electric vehicles (EVs). With EVs emerging as competitive alternatives to internal combustion engine vehicles, overcoming challenges such as limited charging infrastructure is crucial. evS2CP addresses these issues by minimizing the travel time, charging time, and energy consumption, providing practical solutions for both human-operated and autonomous vehicles. This framework leverages V2X communication to integrate essential EV planning data, including route geometry, real-time traffic conditions, and charging station availability, while simulating dynamic driving environments using open-web API services. The speed and charging planning problem was initially formulated as a nonlinear programming model, which was then convexified into a quadratic programming model without charging-stop constraints. Additionally, a mixed-integer programming approach was employed to optimize charging station selection and minimize the frequency of charging events. A mixed-integer quadratic programming implementation exhibited exceptional computational efficiency and scalability, effectively solving trip plans over distances exceeding 700 km in a few seconds. Simulations conducted using open-source and commercial solvers validated the framework's near-global optimality, demonstrating its robustness and feasibility for real-world applications in connected EV ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Strategic Bidding in the Frequency-Containment Ancillary Services Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast integration of non-synchronous renewable energy sources compromises power system stability, increasing vulnerability to frequency deviations due to the lack of inertia. Current efforts to decarbonise electricity grids while maintaining frequency security still rely on Ancillary Services (AS) provision, such as inertia and frequency response, from flexible synchronous generators, placing these type of units in an advantageous position in the AS market. However, in the ongoing transition to decarbonisation, not enough attention has been given to analysing market power in the frequency-containment AS market.
  This work presents a strategic bidding model designed to analyse market power in the coupled energy and frequency-containment AS market. Through a non-convex primal-dual bi-level formulation, we determine the interaction of a strategic market player with the rest of the market that behaves competitively. The case study is based on Great Britain in 2030, demonstrating the capacity of the strategic player to influence prices. While this impact is perceived in the energy market, it is particularly pronounced in the AS market.</description>

      <title>Disturbance-Adaptive Data-Driven Predictive Control: Trading Comfort Violations for Savings in Building Climate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential in improving energy efficiency in building climate control, outperforming traditional controllers commonly used in modern building management systems. Among MPC variants, data-driven predictive control (DPC) offers the advantage of modeling building dynamics directly from data, thereby substantially reducing commissioning efforts. However, inevitable model uncertainties and measurement noise can result in comfort violations, even with dedicated MPC setups. This work introduces a disturbance-adaptive DPC (DAD-DPC) framework designed to ensure asymptotic satisfaction of predefined violation bounds under sufficient conditions. The framework employs a fully data-driven pipeline based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma and conformal prediction for application in building climate control. The proposed DAD-DPC framework was validated using four building cases, leveraging a high-fidelity simulation platform, BOPTEST, and an actual building testbed, Polydome. For a 5% violation bound, the framework achieved energy consumption increases of 2.82%, 2.24%, 3.75%, and 5.09% while reducing comfort violations by 77.62%, 79.51%, 73.26%, and 39.76%, respectively, compared to other controller configurations. These results demonstrate the framework's ability to effectively balance energy consumption and comfort violations, offering a practical solution for building climate control applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Aircraft Scheduling Optimization in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing development of intelligent transportation systems and advancements in aviation technology, the concept of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is gaining attention. This study aims to improve operational safety and service quality within Urban Air Mobility (UAM) through a trajectory-based operation (TBO). A multi-layer operational risk assessment model is introduced to capture the effects of aircraft failure scenarios on critical urban entities, including ground personnel, vehicles, and in-flight UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). Based on this, a single-aircraft track planning model is designed to balance operational risk and transportation cost under the performance constraints of eVTOL (electric Vertical Take-off and Landing) aircraft. A customized track planning algorithm with safety buffer zones is used to identify the most efficient flight paths. Additionally, a multi-aircraft scheduling optimization model is proposed to minimize delays and reduce mid-air collision risks. Experimental results show that the presented approach improves both efficiency and safety, providing practical solutions for UAM operations.</description>

      <title>NExT-LF: A Novel Operational Modal Analysis Method via Tangential Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) is vital for identifying modal parameters under real-world conditions, yet existing methods often face challenges with noise sensitivity and stability. This work introduces NExT-LF, a novel method that combines the well-known Natural Excitation Technique (NExT) with the Loewner Framework (LF). NExT enables the extraction of Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) from output-only vibration data, which are then converted into the frequency domain and used by LF to estimate modal parameters. The proposed method is validated through numerical and experimental case studies. In the numerical study of a 2D Euler-Bernoulli cantilever beam, NExT-LF provides results consistent with analytical solutions and those from the benchmark method, NExT with Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (NExT-ERA). Additionally, NExT-LF demonstrates superior noise robustness, reliably identifying stable modes across various noise levels where NExT-ERA fails. Experimental validation on the Sheraton Universal Hotel is the first OMA application to this structure, confirming NExT-LF as a robust and efficient method for output-only modal parameter identification.</description>

      <title>A novel ML-fuzzy control system for optimizing PHEV fuel efficiency and extending electric range under diverse driving conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming for a greener transportation future, this study introduces an innovative control system for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast energy usage in the pure electric mode of the vehicle and optimize power allocation across different operational modes, including pure electric, series hybrid, parallel hybrid, and internal combustion operation. The fuzzy logic decision-making process governs the vehicle control system. The performance was assessed under various driving conditions. Key findings include a significant enhancement in pure electric mode efficiency, achieving an extended full-electric range of approximately 84 kilometers on an 80% utilization of a 20-kWh battery pack. During the WLTC driving cycle, the control system reduced fuel consumption to 2.86 L/100km, representing a 20% reduction in gasoline-equivalent fuel consumption. Evaluations of vehicle performance at discrete driving speeds, highlighted effective energy management, with the vehicle battery charging at lower speeds and discharging at higher speeds, showing optimized energy recovery and consumption strategies. Initial battery charge levels notably influenced vehicle performance. A 90% initial charge enabled prolonged all-electric operation, minimizing fuel consumption to 2 L/100km less than that of the base control system. Real-world driving pattern analysis revealed significant variations, with shorter, slower cycles requiring lower fuel consumption due to prioritized electric propulsion, while longer, faster cycles increased internal combustion engine usage. The control system also adapted to different battery state of health (SOH) conditions, with higher SOH facilitating extended electric mode usage, reducing total fuel consumption by up to 2.87 L/100km.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear control and stability analysis of a unified Tethered UAV-winder system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a comprehensive dynamics and stabilizing control architecture for Tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) systems. The proposed architecture integrates both onboard and ground-based controllers, employing nonlinear backstepping control techniques to achieve asymptotic stability of the TUAV's equilibrium. The onboard controllers are responsible for the position and attitude control of the TUAV, while the ground controllers regulate the winder mechanism to maintain the desired tether length, ensuring it retains its catenary form. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the TUAV system to accurately track linear and circular trajectories, ensuring robust performance under various operational scenarios. The code and movies demonstrating the performance of the system can be found at https://github.com/sof-danny/TUAV\_system\_control.</description>

      <title>Integrating Optimization Theory with Deep Learning for Wireless Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional wireless network design relies on optimization algorithms derived from domain-specific mathematical models, which are often inefficient and unsuitable for dynamic, real-time applications due to high complexity. Deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative to overcome complexity and adaptability concerns, but it faces challenges such as accuracy issues, delays, and limited interpretability due to its inherent black-box nature. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates optimization theory with deep learning methodologies to address these issues. The methodology starts by constructing the block diagram of the optimization theory-based solution, identifying key building blocks corresponding to optimality conditions and iterative solutions. Selected building blocks are then replaced with deep neural networks, enhancing the adaptability and interpretability of the system. Extensive simulations show that this hybrid approach not only reduces runtime compared to optimization theory based approaches but also significantly improves accuracy and convergence rates, outperforming pure deep learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving lacks strong proof of energy efficiency with the energy-model-agnostic trajectory planning. To achieve an energy consumption model-aware trajectory planning for autonomous driving, this study proposes an online nonlinear programming method that optimizes the polynomial trajectories generated by the Frenet polynomial method while considering both traffic trajectories and road slope prediction. This study further investigates how the energy model can be leveraged in different driving conditions to achieve higher energy efficiency. Case studies, quantitative studies, and ablation studies are conducted in a sedan and truck model to prove the effectiveness of the method.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning solves optimal control and sequential decision problems widely found in control systems engineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence. This work investigates optimal control over a sequence of natural images. The problem is formalized, and general conditions are derived for an image to be sufficient for implementing an optimal policy. Reinforcement learning is shown to be efficient only for certain types of image representations. This is demonstrated by developing a reinforcement learning benchmark that scales easily with number of states and length of horizon, and has optimal policies that are easily distinguished from suboptimal policies. Image representations given by overcomplete sparse codes are found to be computationally efficient for optimal control, using fewer computational resources to learn and evaluate optimal policies. For natural images of fixed size, representing each image as an overcomplete sparse code in a linear network is shown to increase network storage capacity by orders of magnitude beyond that possible for any complete code, allowing larger tasks with many more states to be solved. Sparse codes can be generated by devices with low energy requirements and low computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gaussian Process Pre-Optimization for Asynchronous Event-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras, as bio-inspired sensors, are asynchronously triggered with high-temporal resolution compared to intensity cameras. Recent work has focused on fusing the event measurements with inertial measurements to enable ego-motion estimation in high-speed and HDR environments. However, existing methods predominantly rely on IMU preintegration designed mainly for synchronous sensors and discrete-time frameworks. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time preintegration method based on the Temporal Gaussian Process (TGP) called GPO. Concretely, we model the preintegration as a time-indexed motion trajectory and leverage an efficient two-step optimization to initialize the precision preintegration pseudo-measurements. Our method realizes a linear and constant time cost for initialization and query, respectively. To further validate the proposal, we leverage the GPO to design an asynchronous event-inertial odometry and compare with other asynchronous fusion schemes within the same odometry system. Experiments conducted on both public and own-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed GPO offers significant advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, outperforming existing approaches in handling asynchronous sensor fusion.</description>

      <title>An Event-Triggered Framework for Trust-Mediated Human-Autonomy Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the increased cooperation between humans and autonomous systems, we present a new hybrid systems framework capturing the interconnected dynamics underlying these interactions. The framework accommodates models arising from both the autonomous systems and cognitive psychology literature in order to represent key elements such as human trust in the autonomous system. The intermittent nature of human interactions are incorporated by asynchronous event-triggered sampling at the framework's human-autonomous system interfaces. We illustrate important considerations for tuning framework parameters by investigating a practical application to an autonomous robotic swarm search and rescue scenario. In this way, we demonstrate how the proposed framework may assist in designing more efficient and effective interactions between humans and autonomous systems.</description>

Abstract: Researches on leveraging big artificial intelligence model (BAIM) technology to drive the intelligent evolution of wireless networks are emerging. However, since the breakthrough in generalization brought about by BAIM techniques mainly occurs in natural language processing, there is still a lack of a clear technical roadmap on how to efficiently apply BAIM techniques to wireless systems with many additional peculiarities. To this end, this paper first reviews recent research works on BAIM for wireless and assesses the current research situation. Then, this paper analyzes and compares the differences between language intelligence and wireless intelligence on multiple levels, including scientific foundations, core usages, and technical details. It highlights the necessity and scientific significance of developing BAIM technology in a wireless-native way, as well as new issues that need to be considered in specific technical implementation. Finally, by synthesizing the evolutionary laws of language models with the particularities of wireless system, this paper provides several instructive methodologies for how to develop wireless-native BAIM.</description>

      <title>EmbedGenius: Towards Automated Software Development for Generic Embedded IoT Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedded IoT system development is crucial for enabling seamless connectivity and functionality across a wide range of applications. However, such a complex process requires cross-domain knowledge of hardware and software and hence often necessitates direct developer involvement, making it labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EmbedGenius, the first fully automated software development platform for general-purpose embedded IoT systems. The key idea is to leverage the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedded system expertise to automate the hardware-in-the-loop development process. The main methods include a component-aware library resolution method for addressing hardware dependencies, a library knowledge generation method that injects utility domain knowledge into LLMs, and an auto-programming method that ensures successful deployment. We evaluate EmbedGenius's performance across 71 modules and four mainstream embedded development platforms with over 350 IoT tasks. Experimental results show that EmbedGenius can generate codes with an accuracy of 95.7% and complete tasks with a success rate of 86.5%, surpassing human-in-the-loop baselines by 15.6%--37.7% and 25.5%--53.4%, respectively. We also show EmbedGenius's potential through case studies in environmental monitoring and remote control systems development.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Model-Data Fault Diagnosis for Wafer Handler Robots: Tilt and Broken Belt Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid model- and data-based scheme for fault detection, isolation, and estimation (FDIE) for a class of wafer handler (WH) robots. The proposed hybrid scheme consists of: 1) a linear filter that simultaneously estimates system states and fault-induced signals from sensing and actuation data; and 2) a data-driven classifier, in the form of a support vector machine (SVM), that detects and isolates the fault type using estimates generated by the filter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme for two critical fault types for WH robots used in the semiconductor industry: broken-belt in the lower arm of the WH robot (an abrupt fault) and tilt in the robot arms (an incipient fault). We derive explicit models of the robot motion dynamics induced by these faults and test the diagnostics scheme in a realistic simulation-based case study. These case study results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid FDIE scheme achieves superior performance compared to purely data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained popularity for policy learning in robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal distributions. However, diffusion policies are inherently stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data. DPCC uses constraint tightening and incorporates model-based projections into the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of green energy, the efficiency and reliability of wind turbines are key to sustainable renewable energy production. For that reason, this paper presents a novel intelligent system architecture designed for the dynamic collection and real-time processing of visual data to detect defects in wind turbines. The system employs advanced algorithms within a distributed framework to enhance inspection accuracy and efficiency using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated visual and thermal sensors. An experimental study conducted at the "Staryi Sambir-1" wind power plant in Ukraine demonstrates the system's effectiveness, showing a significant improvement in defect detection accuracy (up to 94%) and a reduction in inspection time per turbine (down to 1.5 hours) compared to traditional methods. The results show that the proposed intelligent system architecture provides a scalable and reliable solution for wind turbine maintenance, contributing to the durability and performance of renewable energy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Convergence of Decentralized Gradient Tracking under the KL Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decentralized multiagent optimization over networks, modeled as undirected graphs. The optimization problem consists of minimizing a nonconvex smooth function plus a convex extended-value function, which enforces constraints or extra structure on the solution (e.g., sparsity, low-rank). We further assume that the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property, with given exponent $\theta\in [0,1)$. The KL property is satisfied by several (nonconvex) functions of practical interest, e.g., arising from machine learning applications; in the centralized setting, it permits to achieve strong convergence guarantees. Here we establish convergence of the same type for the notorious decentralized gradient-tracking-based algorithm SONATA. Specifically, $\textbf{(i)}$ when $\theta\in (0,1/2]$, the sequence generated by SONATA converges to a stationary solution of the problem at R-linear rate;$ \textbf{(ii)} $when $\theta\in (1/2,1)$, sublinear rate is certified; and finally $\textbf{(iii)}$ when $\theta=0$, the iterates will either converge in a finite number of steps or converges at R-linear rate. This matches the convergence behavior of centralized proximal-gradient algorithms except when $\theta=0$. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On Fast-Converged Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Dispatch of Large-Scale Power Systems under Transient Security Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power system optimal dispatch with transient security constraints is commonly represented as Transient Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF). Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based TSC-OPF trains efficient decision-making agents that are adaptable to various scenarios and provide solution results quickly. However, due to the high dimensionality of the state space and action spaces, as well as the non-smoothness of dynamic constraints, existing DRL-based TSC-OPF solution methods face a significant challenge of the sparse reward problem. To address this issue, a fast-converged DRL method for TSC-OPF is proposed in this paper. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) modeling of TSC-OPF is improved by reducing the observation space and smoothing the reward design, thus facilitating agent training. An improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with Curriculum learning, Parallel exploration, and Ensemble decision-making (DDPG-CPEn) is introduced to drastically enhance the efficiency of agent training and the accuracy of decision-making. The effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated through experiments in the IEEE 39-bus system and a practical 710-bus regional power grid. The source code of the proposed method is made public on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Data-Driven Prediction in a Building Control Hierarchy: A Case Study of Demand Response in Switzerland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By providing various services, such as Demand Response (DR), buildings can play a crucial role in the energy market due to their significant energy consumption. However, effectively commissioning buildings for such desired functionalities requires significant expert knowledge and design effort, considering the variations in building dynamics and intended use. In this study, we introduce an adaptive data-driven prediction scheme based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma within the building control hierarchy. This scheme offers a versatile, flexible, and user-friendly interface for diverse prediction and control objectives. We provide an easy-to-use tuning process and an adaptive update pipeline for the scheme, both validated through extensive prediction tests. We evaluate the proposed scheme by coordinating a building and an energy storage system to provide Secondary Frequency Control (SFC) in a Swiss DR program. Specifically, we integrate the scheme into a three-layer hierarchical SFC control framework, and each layer of this hierarchy is designed to achieve distinct operational goals. Apart from its flexibility, our approach significantly improves cost efficiency, resulting in a 28.74% reduction in operating costs compared to a conventional control scheme, as demonstrated by a 52-day experiment in an actual building. Our findings emphasize the potential of the proposed scheme to reduce the commissioning costs of advanced building control strategies and to facilitate the adoption of new techniques in building control.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger's control and estimation paradigm with spatio-temporal distributions on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of reconciling a prior probability law on paths with data was introduced by E. Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving stable synchronized operation in an alternating current power network is critical to the continuity and reliability of energy delivery. In this paper, we study a dynamic model for synchronization in the proposed power network which the National Aeronautic and Space Agency plans to build on the lunar surface to support continuous human presence on the Moon and a lunar economy. This network is quite remarkable in the sense that it is expected to be the first power network to operate at the unprecedented operating frequency in the $\text{kHz}$ range. The particular structure of this network allows us to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence of a unique locally stable synchronized mode, which will provide a passive control mechanism for the system. Furthermore, we study the bifurcation process leading to the loss of synchronization when the system parameters fall outside of the stable regime. Our results have broader implications for many complex networks with parametric heterogeneity to enhance stability and resilience.</description>

      <title>Benefits of V2V communication in connected and autonomous vehicles in the presence of delays in communicated signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of signal delay in communicated information in connected and autonomous vehicles. In particular, we relate this delay's effect on the selection of the time headway in predecessor-follower type vehicle platooning with a constant time headway policy (CTHP). We employ a CTHP control law for each vehicle in the platoon by considering two cases: cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategy where information from only one predecessor vehicle is employed and CACC+ where information from multiple predecessor vehicles is employed. We investigate how the lower bound on the time headway is affected by signal transmission delay due to wireless communication. We provide a systematic approach to the derivation of the lower bound of the time headway and selection of the appropriate CTHP controller gains for predecessor acceleration, velocity error and spacing error which will ensure robust string stability of the platoon under the presence of signal delay. We corroborate the main result with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Framework in Multivariate Time-Series of Industrial Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a new model-free anomaly detection framework is proposed for time-series induced by industrial dynamical systems.The framework lies in the category of conventional approaches which enable appealing features such as a learning with reduced amount of training data, a high potential for explainability as well as a compatibility with incremental learning mechanism to incorporate operator feedback after an alarm is raised and analyzed. Although these are crucial features towards acceptance of data-driven solutions by industry, they are rarely considered in the comparisons that generally almost exclusively focus on performance metrics. Moreover, the features engineering step involved in the proposed framework is inspired by the time-series being implicitly governed by physical laws as it is generally the case in industrial time-series. Two examples are given to assess the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>CommonPower: A Framework for Safe Data-Driven Smart Grid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). However, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure satisfaction of system constraints. Therefore, combining them with formally correct safeguarding mechanisms is an important aspect when studying RL for power system management. Integrating safeguarding into complex use cases requires tool support. To address this need, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower. CommonPower's unique contribution lies in its symbolic modeling approach, which enables flexible, model-based safeguarding of RL controllers. Moreover, CommonPower offers a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, with seamless integration of different forecasting methods. This allows users to validate the effectiveness of safe RL controllers across a large variety of case studies and investigate the influence of specific aspects on overall performance. We demonstrate CommonPower's versatility through a numerical case study that compares RL agents featuring different safeguards with a model predictive controller in the context of building energy management.</description>

      <title>An MDP-Based Approach for Distribution System Control with PV Generation and Battery Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a decision-making approach for the control of distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DERs) equipped with photovoltaic (PV) units and battery energy storage systems (BESS). The objective is to minimize the total operational cost of the distribution system while satisfying the system operating constraints. The method is based on the discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. Different aspects of the distribution system operation are considered, such as the possibilities of curtailment of PV generation, managing battery storage, reactive power injection, load shedding, and providing a flexibility service for the transmission system. The model is tested for the IEEE 33-bus system with two added DERs and the study cases involve various unexpected events. The experimental results show that this method enables the attainment of relatively low total cost values compared to the reference deterministic approach. The benefits of applying this approach are particularly evident when there is a significant difference between the predicted and actual PV power generation.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Input and State Estimation for Multi-agent System with Dynamic Topology and Heterogeneous Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reachability of Uncontrolled Systems via Probability Measures: Approximation via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper poses a theoretical characterization of the stochastic reachability problem in terms of probability measures, capturing the probability measure of the state of the system that satisfies the reachability specification for all probabilities over a finite horizon. We achieve this by constructing the level sets of the probability measure for all probability values and, since our approach is only for autonomous systems, we can determine the level sets via forward simulations of the system from a point in the state space at some time step in the finite horizon to estimate the reach probability. We devise a training procedure which exploits this forward simulation and employ it to design a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the reach probability provided the current state and time step. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through three examples.</description>

      <title>Loewner functions for bilinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work brings together the moment matching approach based on Loewner functions and the classical Loewner framework based on the Loewner pencil in the case of bilinear systems. New Loewner functions are defined based on the bilinear Loewner framework, and a Loewner equivalent model is produced using these functions. This model is composed of infinite series that needs to be truncated in order to be implemented in practice. In this context, a new notion of approximate Loewner equivalence is introduced. In the end, it is shown that the moment matching procedure based on the proposed Loewner functions and the classical interpolatory bilinear Loewner framework both result in $\kappa$-Loewner equivalent models, the main difference being that the latter preserves bilinearity at the expense of a higher order.</description>

      <title>A Novel State-Centric Necessary Condition for Time-Optimal Control of Controllable Linear Systems Based on Augmented Switching Laws (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing necessary conditions for optimal control based on adjoining methods require both state and costate information, yet the unobservability of costates for a given feasible trajectory impedes the determination of optimality in practice. This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input, proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not full row rank, which also results in a potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.</description>

      <title>Meta-Control: Automatic Model-based Control Synthesis for Heterogeneous Robot Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The requirements for real-world manipulation tasks are diverse and often conflicting; some tasks require precise motion while others require force compliance; some tasks require avoidance of certain regions, while others require convergence to certain states. Satisfying these varied requirements with a fixed state-action representation and control strategy is challenging, impeding the development of a universal robotic foundation model. In this work, we propose Meta-Control, the first LLM-enabled automatic control synthesis approach that creates customized state representations and control strategies tailored to specific tasks. Our core insight is that a meta-control system can be built to automate the thought process that human experts use to design control systems. Specifically, human experts heavily use a model-based, hierarchical (from abstract to concrete) thought model, then compose various dynamic models and controllers together to form a control system. Meta-Control mimics the thought model and harnesses LLM's extensive control knowledge with Socrates' "art of midwifery" to automate the thought process. Meta-Control stands out for its fully model-based nature, allowing rigorous analysis, generalizability, robustness, efficient parameter tuning, and reliable real-time execution.</description>

      <title>A Cardinality-Constrained Approach to Combinatorial Bilevel Congestion Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the discrete network design problem, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and determining the corresponding charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to a Kuhn-Tucker-Karush point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000 links, of which hundreds can be tolled. To the best of our knowledge, no existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any assurance of convergence.</description>
