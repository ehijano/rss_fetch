      <title>Vibrational resonance in a frequency-adaptive learning Duffing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational resonance focuses on the resonance behavior of a nonlinear system when it is subjected to both a weak low-frequency characteristic signal and a high-frequency auxiliary signal. A traditional Duffing system has a fixed natural frequency and lacks adaptability to the excitation frequency, resulting in vibrational resonance occurring only in a lower frequency range, which affects the application of vibrational resonance. We propose a frequency-adaptive learning Duffing system to overcome the above problem through a learning rule of the natural frequency. The optimal vibrational resonance performance is demonstrated by examining the influence of auxiliary signal parameters, nonlinear stiffness coefficient and the learning rule on the response. The appearance of vibrational resonance is verified by numerical simulation, approximated theoretical predication and circuit simulation. In addition, the advantages of the proposed frequency-adaptive learning rule are highlighted in vibrational resonance performance by comparing with that of two other commonly used alternatives called Hebbian learning rules. The proposed learning rule makes the system more stable and have a stronger resonance degree. The results provide a useful reference for optimizing nonlinear system response and also for processing a weak characteristic signal through nonlinear resonance methods. These achievements provide a groundbreaking foundation for future applied studies especially in the field of weak and complex signal processing.</description>

      <title>Origin of Frequency Clusters and Robust Triplet Locking in the Kuramoto Model with Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of frequency clusters - states where multiple groups of oscillators with distinct mean frequencies coexist. We use the Kuramoto model with inertia, where identical oscillators are globally coupled. First, we study the creation of two frequency clusters in the thermodynamic limit. Via numerical bifurcation analysis, we confirm that two frequency clusters are created by homoclinic bifurcations. Both clusters can lose their phase-synchrony in transcritical or period-doubling bifurcations. Furthermore, we investigate the creation of three frequency clusters in a system of seven oscillators. Here, the frequency clusters are destabilized by a longitudinal and a transversal period-doubling bifurcation, and the frequency clusters are also created by homoclinic bifurcations. We find that the emergence of three or more frequency clusters via a homoclinic bifurcation implies the creation of a triplet locked state, where the frequency differences exhibit a rational relation. Besides the creation of frequency clusters via a homoclinic bifurcation, we state that Hopf bifurcations cannot create frequency clusters in phase oscillators, and frequency clusters can only be created by global bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Unemployment with Discouraged Workers: A Nonlinear Mathematical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we formulate and analyze a new non-linear mathematical model to describe the dynamics of unemployment with a discouraged working population. We consider five dynamic variables, namely, unskilled unemployed individuals, skilled unemployed individuals, discouraged individuals, employed persons, and job vacancies. Furthermore, we determine the equilibrium points of the dynamic system and investigate their local stability. To demonstrate the results, we conduct numerical simulations by presenting solution trajectories and analyzing how variations in key parameters influence the states of the dynamical variables.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of Euler characteristic of finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Criticality from Protected Mean-Field Dynamics: Loop Stability and Internal Renormalization in Reflective Neural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reflective homeostatic dynamics provides a minimal mechanism for self-organized criticality in neural systems. Starting from a reduced stochastic description, we demonstrate within the MSRJD field-theoretic framework that fluctuation effects do not destabilize the critical manifold. Instead, loop corrections are dynamically regularized by homeostatic curvature, yielding a protected mean-field critical surface that remains marginally stable under coarse-graining. Beyond robustness, we show that response-driven structural adaptation generates intrinsic parameter flows that attract the system toward this surface without external fine tuning. Together, these results unify loop renormalization and adaptive response in a single framework and establish a concrete route to autonomous criticality in reentrant neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Vicsek Model Meets DBSCAN: Cluster Phases in the Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek model, which was originally proposed to explain the dynamics of bird flocking, exhibits a phase transition with respect to the absolute value of the mean velocity. Although clusters of agents can be easily observed via numerical simulations of the Vicsek model, qualitative studies are lacking. We study the clustering structure of the Vicsek model by applying DBSCAN, a recently-introduced clustering algorithm, and report that the Vicsek model shows a phase transition with respect to the number of clusters: from O(N) to O(1), with N being the number of agents, when increasing the magnitude of noise for a fixed radius that specifies the interaction of the Vicsek model. We also report that the combination of the order parameter proposed by Vicsek et al. and the number of clusters defines at least four phases of the Vicsek model.</description>

      <title>Pregnancy as a dynamical paradox: robustness, control and birth onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The timing of human labor is among the most critical determinants of neonatal survival, yet the mechanisms that govern the transition from uterine quiescence to coordinated contractions remain elusive. Here we present a dynamical-systems framework that models the pregnant uterus as a spatially extended network of electrically excitable cells regulated by sparse adaptive feedback mimicking hormonal and mechanical influences. This approach reveals how stability during gestation and sensitivity near parturition can be simultaneously maintained through the interplay of control, network structure, and noise. Our analysis shows that spontaneous contractions such as Braxton-Hicks and Alvarez waves are not epiphenomena, but functional components that reduce control effort and preserve responsiveness. Moreover, we identify preterm labor as a boundary-crossing phenomenon arising when control fails to correctly interpret early-warning signals. These results establish a unifying mechanistic theory for labor onset, yield testable predictions, and suggest new therapeutic strategies to mitigate preterm birth risk.</description>
