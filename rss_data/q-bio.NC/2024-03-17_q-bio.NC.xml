      <title>A Quasi-Stationary Approach to Metastability in a System of Spiking Neurons with Synaptic Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After reviewing the behavioral studies of working memory and of the cellular substrate of the latter, we argue that metastable states constitute candidates for the type of transient information storage required by working memory. We then present a simple neural network model made of stochastic units whose synapses exhibit short-term facilitation. The Markov process dynamics of this model was specifically designed to be analytically tractable, simple to simulate numerically and to exhibit a quasi-stationary distribution (QSD). Since the state space is finite this QSD is also a Yaglom limit, which allows us to bridge the gap between quasi-stationarity and metastability by considering the relative orders of magnitude of the relaxation and absorption times. We present first analytical results: characterization of the absorbing region of the Markov process, irreducibility outside this absorbing region and consequently existence and uniqueness of a QSD. We then apply Perron-Frobenius spectral analysis to  obtain any specific QSD, and design an approximate method for the first moments of this QSD when the exact method is intractable. Finally we use these methods to study the relaxation time toward the QSD and establish numerically the memorylessness of the time of extinction.</description>

      <title>Understanding data analysis aspects of TMS-EEG in clinical study: a mini review and a case study with open dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concurrency of transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) technique is a powerful and challenging methodology for basic research and clinical applications. Aspects considered in experiments for effective TMS-EEG recordings and analysis, including artifact management, data analysis and interpretation and protocols. mini review offers an extensive insight of TMS-EEG methodology in experimental and computational procedures. Case study aims to leverage an openly available, high-quality EEG dataset to delve into the alterations in cortical activity. By applying Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in healthy individuals, we observe changes in oscillatory patterns within the EEG data. The dataset includes meticulously extracted resting-state EEG recordings, TMS-evoked potential data, and MRI scans. To process these data, we utilized Brainstorm, an open-source Matlab application, which facilitated noise reduction through independent component analysis and signal-space projection techniques. It allowed us to identify, visualize, and analyze TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and TMS-induced oscillations (TIOs). In addition, the study presents detailed plots of resting-state EEG power, local mean field power (LMFP), TMS-related spectral perturbation (TSRP), and inter-trial phase clustering (ITPC). Paired t-tests and cluster-based permutation tests have been performed for statistical analysis. The wealth and quality of this dataset make it ideal for examining the neuromodulatory impact of TBS on the prefrontal cortex. Brainstorm's extensive feature set greatly supports the exploration of such neurological data. Future research directions could concentrate on conducting source localization analyses and comparative group studies.</description>

      <title>Texture Recognition Using a Biologically Plausible Spiking Phase-Locked Loop Model for Spike Train Frequency Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel spiking neural network model designed to perform frequency decomposition of spike trains. Our model emulates neural microcircuits theorized in the somatosensory cortex, rendering it a biologically plausible candidate for decoding the spike trains observed in tactile peripheral nerves. We demonstrate the capacity of simple neurons and synapses to replicate the phase-locked loop (PLL) and explore the emergent properties when considering multiple spiking phase-locked loops (sPLLs) with diverse oscillations. We illustrate how these sPLLs can decode textures using the spectral features elicited in peripheral nerves. Leveraging our model's frequency decomposition abilities, we improve state-of-the-art performances on a Multifrequency Spike Train (MST) dataset. This work offers valuable insights into neural processing and presents a practical framework for enhancing artificial neural network capabilities in complex pattern recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Thalamocortical interactions shape hierarchical neural variability during stimulus perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain is hierarchically organized to process sensory signals. But, to what extent do functional connections within and across areas shape this hierarchical order? We addressed this problem in the thalamocortical network, while monkeys judged the presence or absence of a vibrotactile stimulus. We quantified the variability by means of intrinsic timescales and Fano factor, and functional connectivity by means of a directionality measure in simultaneously recorded neurons sharing the same cutaneous receptive field from the somatosensory thalamus (VPL) and areas 3b and 1 from the somatosensory cortex. During the pre-stimulus periods, VPL and area 3b exhibited similarly fast dynamics while area 1 showed much slower timescales. Furthermore, during the stimulus presence, the Fano factor increased along the network VPL-3b-1. In parallel, VPL established two separate main feedforward pathways with areas 3b and 1 to process stimulus information. While feedforward interactions from VPL and area 3b were favored by neurons within specific Fano factor ranges, neural variability in area 1 was invariant to the incoming pathways. In contrast to VPL and area 3b, during the stimulus arrival, area 1 showed significant intra-area interactions, which mainly pointed to neurons with slow intrinsic timescales. Overall, our results suggest that the lower variability of VPL and area 3b regulates feedforward thalamocortical communication, while the higher variability of area 1 supports intra-cortical interactions during sensory processing. These results provide evidence of a hierarchical order along the thalamocortical network.</description>

      <title>Large language models surpass human experts in predicting neuroscience results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific discoveries often hinge on synthesizing decades of research, a task that potentially outstrips human information processing capacities. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution. LLMs trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. To evaluate this possibility, we created BrainBench, a forward-looking benchmark for predicting neuroscience results. We find that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an LLM we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs were confident in their predictions, they were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where humans and LLMs team together to make discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience-specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavors.</description>

      <title>Human Brain Exhibits Distinct Patterns When Listening to Fake Versus Real Audio: Preliminary Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the variations in human brain activity when listening to real and fake audio. Our preliminary results suggest that the representations learned by a state-of-the-art deepfake audio detection algorithm, do not exhibit clear distinct patterns between real and fake audio. In contrast, human brain activity, as measured by EEG, displays distinct patterns when individuals are exposed to fake versus real audio. This preliminary evidence enables future research directions in areas such as deepfake audio detection.</description>
