      <title>Anomaly Detection in Cooperative Vehicle Perception Systems under Imperfect Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical requirement for ensuring safety in autonomous driving. In this work, we leverage Cooperative Perception to share information across nearby vehicles, enabling more accurate identification and consensus of anomalous behaviors in complex traffic scenarios. To account for the real-world challenge of imperfect communication, we propose a cooperative-perception-based anomaly detection framework (CPAD), which is a robust architecture that remains effective under communication interruptions, thereby facilitating reliable performance even in low-bandwidth settings. Since no multi-agent anomaly detection dataset exists for vehicle trajectories, we introduce 15,000 different scenarios with a 90,000 trajectories benchmark dataset generated through rule-based vehicle dynamics analysis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms standard anomaly classification methods in F1-score, AUC and showcase strong robustness to agent connection interruptions.</description>

      <title>From Natural Language to Extensive-Form Game Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17282v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into extensive-form representations in game theory, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Given the varying levels of strategic complexity in games, such as perfect versus imperfect information, directly applying in-context learning would be insufficient. To address this, we introduce a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets along and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.</description>

      <title>Coalitional model predictive control of an irrigation canal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical control scheme for large-scale systems whose components can exchange information through a data network. The main goal of the supervisory layer is to find the best compromise between control performance and communicational costs by actively modifying the network topology. The actions taken at the supervisory layer alter the control agents' knowledge of the complete system, and the set of agents with which they can communicate. Each group of linked subsystems, or coalition, is independently controlled based on a decentralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme, managed at the bottom layer. Hard constraints on the inputs are imposed, while soft constraints on the states are considered to avoid feasibility issues. The performance of the proposed control scheme is validated on a model of the Dez irrigation canal, implemented on the accurate simulator for water systems SOBEK. Finally, the results are compared with those obtained using a centralized MPC controller.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Context-Aware Multi-Agent Systems: Techniques, Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research interest in autonomous agents is on the rise as an emerging topic. The notable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the considerable potential to attain human-like intelligence in autonomous agents. However, the challenge lies in enabling these agents to learn, reason, and navigate uncertainties in dynamic environments. Context awareness emerges as a pivotal element in fortifying multi-agent systems when dealing with dynamic situations. Despite existing research focusing on both context-aware systems and multi-agent systems, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys outlining techniques for integrating context-aware systems with multi-agent systems. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art context-aware multi-agent systems. First, we outline the properties of both context-aware systems and multi-agent systems that facilitate integration between these systems. Subsequently, we propose a general process for context-aware systems, with each phase of the process encompassing diverse approaches drawn from various application domains such as collision avoidance in autonomous driving, disaster relief management, utility management, supply chain management, human-AI interaction, and others. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges of context-aware multi-agent systems and provide future research directions in this field.</description>

      <title>On the external concurrency of current BDI frameworks for MAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The execution of Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents in a Multi-Agent System (MAS) can be practically implemented on top of low-level concurrency mechanisms that impact on efficiency, determinism, and reproducibility. We argue that developers should specify the MAS behaviour independently of the execution model, and choose or configure the concurrency model later on, according to the specific needs of their target domain, leaving the MAS specification unaffected. We identify patterns for mapping the agent execution over the underlying concurrency abstractions, and investigate which concurrency models are supported by some of the most commonly used BDI platforms. Although most frameworks support multiple concurrency models, we find that they mostly hide them under the hood, making them opaque to the developer, and actually limiting the possibility of fine-tuning the MAS.</description>

      <title>Concurrency Model of BDI Programming Frameworks: Why Should We Control It?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a taxonomy of concurrency models for BDI frameworks, elicited by analysing state-of-the-art technologies, and aimed at helping both BDI designers and developers in making informed decisions. Comparison among BDI technologies w.r.t. concurrency models reveals heterogeneous support, and low customisability.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>

      <title>The impact of behavioral diversity in multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many of the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change and global peace, require complex collective problem-solving skills. Recent studies indicate that diversity in individuals' behaviors is key to developing such skills and increasing collective performance. Yet behavioral diversity in collective artificial learning is understudied, with today's machine learning paradigms commonly favoring homogeneous agent strategies over heterogeneous ones, mainly due to computational considerations. In this work, we employ diversity measurement and control paradigms to study the impact of behavioral heterogeneity in several facets of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Through experiments in team play and other cooperative tasks, we show the emergence of unbiased behavioral roles that improve team outcomes; how behavioral diversity synergizes with morphological diversity; how diverse agents are more effective at finding cooperative solutions in sparse reward settings; and how behaviorally heterogeneous teams learn and retain latent skills to overcome repeated disruptions. Overall, our results indicate that, by controlling diversity, we can obtain non-trivial benefits over homogeneous training paradigms, demonstrating that diversity is a fundamental component of collective artificial learning, an insight thus far overlooked.</description>
