      <title>Operator dynamics and entanglement in space-time dual Hadamard lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body quantum dynamics defined on a spatial lattice and in discrete time -- either as stroboscopic Floquet systems or quantum circuits -- has been an active area of research for several years. Being discrete in space and time, a natural question arises: when can such a model be viewed as evolving unitarily in space as well as in time? Models with this property, which sometimes goes by the name space-time duality, have been shown to have a number of interesting features related to entanglement growth and correlations. One natural way in which the property arises in the context of (brickwork) quantum circuits is by choosing dual unitary gates: two site operators that are unitary in both the space and time directions. We introduce a class of models with $q$ states per site, defined on the square lattice by a complex partition function and paremeterized in terms of $q\times q$ Hadamard matrices, that have the property of space-time duality. These may interpreted as particular dual unitary circuits or stroboscopically evolving systems, and generalize the well studied self-dual kicked Ising model. We explore the operator dynamics in the case of Clifford circuits, making connections to Clifford cellular automata [J. Math. Phys. 49, 112104 (2008)] and in the $q\to\infty$ limit to the classical spatiotemporal cat model of many body chaos [Nonlinearity 34, 2800 (2021)]. We establish integrability and the corresponding conserved charges for a large subfamily and show how the long-range entanglement protocol discussed in the recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 105, 144306 (2022)] can be reinterpreted in purely graphical terms and directly applied here.</description>

      <title>Early-time resonances in the three-dimensional wall-bounded axisymmetric Euler and related equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complex-time analytic structure of solutions of the 3D-axisymmetric, wall-bounded, incompressible Euler equations, by starting with the initial data proposed in Luo and Hou (2014), to study a possible finite-time singularity. We use our pseudospectral Fourier-Chebyshev method, with quadruple-precision arithmetic, to compute the time-Taylor series coefficients of the flow fields, up to a high order. We show that the resulting approximations display early-time resonances; the initial spatial location of these structures is different from that for the tygers, which we have obtained in Kolluru et al. (2022). We then perform asymptotic analysis of the Taylor-series coefficients, by using generalised ratio methods, to extract the location and nature of the convergence-limiting singularities and demonstrate that these singularities are distributed around the origin, in the complex-t2 plane, along two curves that resemble the shape of an eye. We obtain similar results for the 1D wall-approximation (of the full 3D-axisymmetric Euler equation) called the 1D HL model, for which we use Fourier-pseudospectral methods to compute the time-Taylor series coefficients of the flow fields. Our work examines the link between tygers, in Galerkin-truncated pseudospectral studies, and early-time resonances, in truncated time-Taylor expansions of solutions of PDEs, such as those we consider.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of soliton lengths in a multicolor box-ball system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.04458v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The box-ball systems are integrable cellular automata whose long-time behavior is characterized by soliton solutions, with rich connections to other integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this paper, we consider a multicolor box-ball system with two types of random initial configurations and obtain sharp scaling limits of the soliton lengths as the system size tends to infinity. We obtain a sharp scaling limit of soliton lengths that turns out to be more delicate than that in the single color case established in [Levine, Lyu, Pike '20]. A large part of our analysis is devoted to studying the associated carrier process, which is a multi-dimensional Markov chain on the orthant, whose excursions and running maxima are closely related to soliton lengths. We establish the sharp scaling of its ruin probabilities, Skorokhod decomposition, strong law of large numbers, and weak diffusive scaling limit to a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion with explicit parameters. We also establish and utilize complementary descriptions of the soliton lengths and numbers in terms of modified Greene-Kleitman invariants for the box-ball systems and associated circular exclusion processes.</description>

      <title>Another Type of Forward and Backward Shift Relations for Orthogonal Polynomials in the Askey Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The forward and backward shift relations are basic properties of the (basic) hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme (Jacobi, Askey-Wilson, $q$-Racah, big $q$-Jacobi etc.) and they are related to the factorization of the differential or difference operators. Based on other factorizations, we obtain another type of forward and backward shift relations. Essentially, these shift relations shift only the parameters.</description>

      <title>Rotation matrix of a charged symmetrical body: one-parameter family of solutions in elementary functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equations of motion of a charged symmetrical body in external constant and homogeneous electric and magnetic fields are deduced starting from the variational problem, where the body is considered as a system of charged point particles subject to holonomic constraints. The final equations are written for the center-of mass-coordinate, rotation matrix and angular velocity. General solution to the equations of motion is obtained for the case of a charged ball. For the case of a symmetrical charged body (solenoid), the task of obtaining the general solution is reduced to the problem of a one-dimensional cubic pseudo-oscillator. Besides, we present a one-parametric family of solutions to the problem in elementary functions.</description>
