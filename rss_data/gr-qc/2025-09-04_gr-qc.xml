      <title>The hyperbolically symmetric black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe some properties of the hyperbolically symmetric black hole (hereafter referred to as the $HSBH$) proposed a few years ago. We start by explaining the main motivation behind such an idea, and we determine the main differences between this scenario and the classical black hole (hereafter referred to as the $CBH$) scenario. Particularly important are the facts that, in the $HSBH$ scenario, (i) test particles in the region inside the horizon experience a repulsive force that prevents them from reaching the center, (ii) test particles may cross the horizon outward only along the symmetry axis, and (iii) the spacetime within the horizon is static but not spherically symmetric. Next, we examine the differences between the two models of black holes in light of the Landauer principle and the Hawking results on the eventual evaporation of the black hole and the paradox resulting thereof. Finally, we explore what observational signature could be invoked to confirm or dismiss the model.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Casimir wormholes within Einstein-Cartan gravity framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory of gravity provides a natural extension of general relativity by incorporating spacetime torsion to account for the intrinsic spin of matter. In this work, we investigate Yukawa-Casimir traversable wormholes supported by three distinct Yukawa-Casimir energy density profiles within the framework of EC gravity. The resulting shape functions are shown to satisfy all the fundamental requirements for traversable wormhole geometries. Our analysis reveals that the presence of exotic matter is unavoidable in sustaining these wormholes, and we quantify its total amount through the volume integral quantifier. Furthermore, the equilibrium of the wormhole configurations is established by examining the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. To enhance the physical relevance of the present work, we study several key features of the wormholes, including the embedding surface, proper radial distance, tidal forces, and total gravitational energy. In addition, we analyze the optical properties of wormholes by examining both the shadow and the strong deflection angle. All the findings collectively demonstrate the physical plausibility of Yukawa-Casimir traversable wormholes within the EC gravity framework.</description>

      <title>Deflection Angle of Regular Black Holes in Nonlinear Electrodynamics: Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, Time Delay, Shadow, and Greybody Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the weak gravitational lensing in the background of regular, static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions of Einstein's standard general relativity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics. The weak deflection angles are estimated in the context of vacuum medium and plasma medium using the Gauss-Bonnet method. The obtained deflection angles decrease as the impact parameter $b$ and the charge parameter $q$ increase, while the deflection angles increase gradually with increasing values of the black hole mass $m$. Moreover, the effect of a plasma medium has increased the deflection angle than the vacuum medium scenario. We also estimate the time delay in the field of the described black holes that vanishes for $m = q =0$, i.e., the absence of the black holes. The shadow cast of the present black holes is also analyzed with respect to the impact $q$ and mass $m$, which ensures that the shadow region shrinks for increasing values of $q$ and expands for increasing values of $m$. In addition, we estimated the rigorous bounds of the greybody factor $\mathcal{T}_b$ for the described black holes and the graphical analysis ensures that the increasing charge parameter $q$ decreases the rigorous bound of $\mathcal{T}_b$ and the increasing mass $m$ increases the rigorous bound of $\mathcal{T}_b$.</description>

      <title>Impact of Pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 Observations on $f(\mathcal{Q}, \mathbb{T})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this study is to investigate the viability and stability of a pulsar filled with anisotropic matter in $f(\mathcal{Q}, \mathbb{T})$ gravity, where $\mathcal{Q}$ represents non-metricity and $\mathbb{T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In this context, we employ non-singular solution and a particular model of this gravity. We use junction conditions to evaluate unknown constants in the metric coefficients. Observations from the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 star are employed to validate the model, producing stable configurations that address both geometric and physical characteristics. This framework establishes relationships between various physical quantities, including fluid parameters, anisotropy, mass-radius relation, redshift, the Zeldovich condition, energy conditions, causality conditions, adiabatic index, Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, the equation of state parameter, and compactness. Our findings confirm the viability and stability of the proposed pulsar star in this theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>An innovative black hole solution and thermodynamic properties in higher-order curvature gravity with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spherically symmetric black hole solution defined by the gravitational mass is explored in higher-order curvature gravity associated with a scalar field. It is demonstrated that the singularities of the curvature invariants will be far weaker around the central region of the black hole than those in general relativity, owing to the effect originating from higher-order curvatures with the coupling to a dynamical scalar field. Furthermore, thermodynamic properties and the Davies-type phase transition of the black hole are investigated for Barrow entropy with a quantum effect of gravitation. It is found that both the quasi-local energy and Gibbs free energy are positive, and the black hole can hence be stable on the smooth horizon surface. In addition, by analyzing the geodesic deviation, the stability conditions of the black hole are explicitly shown.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant perturbations of $F(T,T_G)$ Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gauss-Bonnet invariant connects foundational aspects of geometry with physical phenomena in a variety of ways. Teleparallel gravity offers a novel direction in which to use the Gauss-Bonnet invariant to go beyond standard cosmology. In this work, we explore the cosmological perturbations of teleparallel gravity generalized through the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. This is crucial in understanding the viability of these models beyond background analyses. We do this by taking a gauge invariant approach, which is followed by popular gauge choice examples. It is important to take this approach to understand the stability and healthiness of the underlying theory. We determine the equations of motion for all perturbative modes and offer a physical interpretation for the new contributions for each of the modes.</description>

      <title>Dark tranquility: Overdamped quasibound states inside a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black-hole interiors, bounded by event horizons and terminated by spacelike singularities, are regions where all physical observers are inevitably destroyed. However, the behavior of wave propagation in such extreme habitats remains rich and nuanced. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that persist without ever reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Saturation of Chaos Bound in a Phenomenological Rotating Black Hole--Effective Matter System at Low-Temperature Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chaotic behavior of a phenomenological system of rotating black holes (BHs) surrounded by radiation, dust, and dark matter as effective matter fluids. We show that the chaos bound is saturated -- but never violated -- when the density parameter $k \rightarrow 1$, which corresponds to a high dark matter concentration in the halo. This saturation is independent of radiation and dust density, occurring in the low-temperature regime where the BH's surface gravity and Hawking temperature decrease. Our results suggest that rotating BHs subjected to a phenomenological representation of a more realistic matter environment can scramble information as efficiently as allowed by physical laws in this limit. This work links quantum chaos research with phenomenological BH-matter configurations, providing a motivation for studies of chaos in astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the Black Hole Interior Volume and Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic and conceptual notion of this work starts from the recent investigations of Marios Christodoulou and Carlo Rovelli (CR) in their paper entitled ''How big is a black hole?''. This work is related to the black hole interior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically symmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior volume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a space-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$. Using this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is proportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this formulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of infalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of Hawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the charged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical analysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the volume linearly increases with advancing time.
  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black hole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black hole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality constant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy is less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy). Note that these analyses are only applicable for black holes with mass greater than the Planck mass. If massless than Planck's mass, then one needs to understand the uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Viability Constraints on Baryogenesis in f (R, Lm, T) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study explores gravitational baryogenesis in the context of f(R, Lm, T) gravity, where R denotes the Ricci scalar, Lm represents the Lagrangian density of the matter field, and T stands for the metric contraction of T_{mu nu}. We focus on a linear model: f(R, Lm, T) = alpha R + beta Lm + gamma T, and examine the parameter constraints for a successful baryon asymmetry generation in four different eras of the cosmos under the assumption of a power-law cosmic expansion. The computed baryon-to-entropy ratio is found to be consistent with the observed order of asymmetry ratio, 9.42 x 10^-11. Furthermore, the study is extended to the generalized framework of gravitational baryogenesis, where the outcome shows strong agreement with the current observational data. Our findings indicate that the f(R, Lm, T) framework provides a compatible theoretical foundation for producing the observed matter imbalance of the cosmos, thereby emphasizing its potential significance in early-universe cosmology.</description>

      <title>The Spectroscopy of the 2+1 Dimensional Analog Black Hole in Photon-Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore quasibound states (QBS), scalar cloud, Hawking radiation, superradiance, and greybody factor of relativistic massive phonon modes in a photon-fluid rotation black hole. We investigate quasibound states and scalar clouds using exact eigensolutions to the analog Klein-Gordon equation in the analog black hole background and revisit the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) upper bound on the scalar clouds' energy ratio. Using the obtained exact radial solution, we use the Damour-Ruffini method to calculate the power spectrum of the analog black hole's Hawking radiation. We then use the analytical asymptotic matching technique (AAM) to investigate the analog black hole's superradiance for low energy massive photon scattering, resulting in the analytical amplification factor and the greybody factor formulas of the analog black hole. We discover that the analog black hole in the photon-fluid model is superradiant with an energy range of $\varpi &lt; \omega&lt;m_\ell\Omega_H$. As a result, the greybody factors are negative for co-rotating modes in the superradiant regime.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger lensing time delay as a probe of the graviton mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology and astrophysics. With the prospect of the first strongly lensed gravitational waves on the horizon, we highlight an opportunity to test fundamental physics. In this work, we assume a nonzero mass for the graviton, which leads to gravitational waves following timelike geodesics instead of null geodesics. We derive standard gravitational lensing equations, such as the scattering angle, the time-delay between different images and the magnification, which normally rely on the assumption of null geodesics. We show that a single strongly lensed multi-messenger event is enough to constrain the graviton mass to $m&lt; 3 \cdot 10^{-23}$ eV/c$^{2}$. Notably this constraint is independent of the lens model, the waveform model, and of cosmology. Additionally, we explore magnification of images and find that they offer at least three orders of magnitude weaker bounds than the time delay, and have a dependence on the correct modeling of the lens and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming a sufficiently general form for the matter distribution function of a galactic halo, we have derived solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations describing a charged black hole embedded in such a halo, while also allowing for a non-zero cosmological constant. These solutions generalize our earlier results for neutral black holes in asymptotically flat spacetime. As specific realizations of the general distribution, we consider the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White, Burkert, Taylor-Silk, and Moore halo profiles, thereby capturing a broad range of astrophysically motivated scenarios.</description>

      <title>Wigner function of a rigidly rotating and magnetized QED plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the Wigner function of a rigidly rotating quantum electrodynamics (QED) plasma in the presence of a constant magnetic field by utilizing the Riemannian normal coordinate approximation, which has been previously proposed in the literature. In this approach, the angular velocity appears only in a specific phase factor, allowing us to compute the point-split fermion two-point correlation function in flat spacetime. To ensure that the fermion correlation function is gauge invariant, we introduce a background gauge field that is fixed to produce a constant magnetic field. Using this Wigner function, we derive the energy-momentum tensor for this medium, which consists of both diagonal and off-diagonal components. By comparing our results with the energy-momentum tensor of an ideal spinful and vortical magnetized fluid, we establish a connection between these components and thermodynamic quantities, such as energy density and different types of pressure. We demonstrate that rigid rotation leads to pressure anisotropy in plasma. Additionally, we compute the associated vector and axial vector currents for this medium, utilizing the previously presented Wigner function. Our results are consistent with existing literature on the subject.</description>

      <title>The stability of the de-Sitter universe in nonlocal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constructed the ghost-free condition for nonlocal gravity using de-Sitter background field expansion and identified the structure of the nontrivial form factors. Our analysis shows that the particle spectrum of this model is nearly equivalent to general relativity (GR), with the potential addition of a scalar particle with positive mass m. Additionally, by employing recursion relations, we established the equivalence between nonlocal gravity and higher-derivative gravity. Moreover, we provided a comprehensive non-perturbative proof of the stability of de-Sitter solution within the nonlocal framework.</description>

      <title>Local Well-Posedness for the Bartnik Stationary Extension Problem near Schwarzschild Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Bartnik stationary extension conjecture, which arises from the definition of the spacetime Bartnik mass for a compact region in a general initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. This conjecture posits the existence and uniqueness (up to isometry) of an asymptotically flat stationary vacuum spacetime containing an initial data set $(M, \mathfrak{g}, \Pi)$ that realizes prescribed Bartnik boundary data on $\partial M$, consisting of the induced metric, mean curvature, and appropriate components of the spacetime extrinsic curvature $\Pi$.
  Building on the analytic framework developed in arXiv:2411.02801 for the static case, we show that, in a double geodesic gauge, the stationary vacuum Einstein equations reduce to a coupled system comprising elliptic and transport-type equations, with the genuinely stationary contributions encoded in an additional boundary value problem for a $1$-form $\theta$. Our approach employs both a geodesic gauge for the quotient metric $g$ in the quotient formalism and a $\theta$-geodesic gauge for the $1$-form $\theta$.
  We establish local well-posedness for the Bartnik stationary metric extension problem for Bartnik data sufficiently close to that of any coordinate sphere in a Schwarzschild ${t=0}$ slice, including data with arbitrarily small mean curvature. A key feature of our framework is that the linearized equations decouple: the equations for the metric and potential reduce to the previously solved static case, while the boundary value problem for $\theta$ is treated independently. We prove solvability of this boundary value problem in the Bochner-measurable function spaces adapted to the coupled system developed in arXiv:2411.02801, establishing uniform estimates for the vector spherical harmonic decomposition of $\theta$.</description>

      <title>Verification of the Black Hole Area Law with GW230814</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observational confirmation of Hawking's black-hole area theorem using the newly released gravitational-wave data from the GWTC-4 catalog. We have analyzed two high signal-to-noise ratio binary black hole (BBH) merger events, including GW230814 and GW231226, from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 run, and measured the (total) horizon area of the black holes before and after merger. For both events, the horizon area of the remnant black hole is found to be greater than the total horizon area of the two pre-merger black holes at a high possibility (effectively $\gtrsim 99\%$), and particularly with GW230814 we have a significance level of $\gtrsim 5\sigma$ for the {\it first} time. These results provide the direct convincing verification of the black-hole area law, further bolstering the validity of classical general relativity in the dynamical, strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Influence of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter on Shadow Observables of Yang-Mills modified charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) on Yang--Mills--inspired charged black holes, with a particular focus on the resulting modifications to key black hole observables. By embedding a PFDM term into the spacetime geometry, we examine the alterations in shadow morphology, photon geodesics, and the associated energy emission spectra. Our analysis reveals that PFDM induces notable deviations in the shadow size, shape, and circularity, and significantly impacts the stability of circular orbits. Furthermore, the energy emission rate exhibits a strong dependence on both the Yang--Mills charge and the dark matter distribution. These results indicate that environmental effects arising from dark matter can imprint observable signatures on black hole shadows and radiation processes, offering a potential pathway to constrain dark matter models and probe non-Kerr geometries with forthcoming high-precision observations such as those from the Event Horizon Telescope and next-generation interferometers.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Cosmologies in modified gravity with space time torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of realizing a non-singular bounce in the early universe within the framework of modified gravity with spacetime torsion. In Einstein Cartan theory, torsion is embedded in the spacetime by adding an antisymmetric part in affine connection . We consider generalized version of the framework as $f(\bar{R})$, $\bar{R}$ being the scalar of the modified curvature tensor. $f(\bar{R})$ gravity is recast in Einstein frame as non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory where the scalar field gets coupled with a rank 2 antisymmetric torsion field through derivative couplings. We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have also found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String theory has strong implications for cosmology: it tells us that we cannot have a cosmological constant, that single-field slow-roll inflation is ruled out, and that black holes decay. We elucidate the origin of these statements within the string-theoretical swampland programme. The swampland programme is generating a growing body of insights that have yet to be incorporated into cosmological models. Taking a cosmologist's perspective, we highlight the relevance of swampland conjectures to black holes, dark matter, dark energy, and inflation, including their implications for scalar fields such as quintessence and axions. Our goal is to inspire cosmological model builders to examine the compatibility of effective field theories with quantum gravitational UV completions and to address outstanding cosmological tensions such as the Hubble tension. This comprehensive literature review presents clear definitions, cosmological implications, and the current status - including evidence and counterexamples - of the following swampland conjectures: the anti-de Sitter distance conjecture (AdSDC), the completeness conjecture (CC), the cobordism conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture (dSC), the swampland distance conjecture (SDC), the emergence proposal (EP), the Festina Lente Bound (FLB), the finite number of massless fields conjecture (or finite flux vacua conjecture (FFV)), the no global symmetries conjecture, the no non-supersymmetric theories conjecture, the non-negative null energy condition conjecture, the positive Gauss-Bonnet term conjecture, the species scale conjecture, the gravitino swampland conjecture (GSC), the tadpole conjecture, the tameness conjecture, the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (tPCC/TCC), the unique geodesic conjecture, and the weak gravity conjecture (WGC), including the repulsive force conjecture (RFC).</description>

      <title>Quantum Vacuum energy as the origin of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the idea that quantum vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac} $ is at the origin of Gravity as a theoretical exercise. We formulate a gravitational version of the electromagnetic Casimir effect, and provide an argument for how gravity can arise from $\rho_{\rm vac} $ by showing how Einstein's field equations emerge in the form of Friedmann's equations. This leads to the idea that Newton's constant $G_N$ is environmental, namely it depends on the total mass-energy of the Universe $M_\infty $ and its size $R_\infty $, with $G_N = c^2 R_\infty /2 M_\infty$. This leads to a new interpretation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of de Sitter space, and also the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for black holes, wherein the quantum information bits are quantized massless particles at the horizon with wavelength $\lambda = 2 \pi R_\infty$. We assume a recently proposed formula for $\rho_{\rm vac} \sim m_z^4/\mathfrak{g}$, where $m_z$ is the mass of the lightest particle, and $\mathfrak{g}$ is a marginally irrelevant coupling. This leads to an effective, induced RG flow for Newton's constant $G_N$ as a function of an energy scale, which indicates that $G_N$ decreases at higher energies until it reaches a Landau pole at a minimal value of the cosmological scale factor $a(t) &gt; a_{\rm min}$, thus avoiding the usual geometric singularity at $a=0$. We propose that this energy scale dependent $G_N$ can explain the Hubble tension and we thereby constrain the coupling constant $\mathfrak{g}$ and its renormalization group parameters. For the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model we estimate $a_{\rm min} \approx e^{-1/\hat{b} }$ where $\hat{b} \approx 0.02$ based on the Hubble tension data.</description>

      <title>Primordial Physics in the Nonlinear Universe: mapping cosmological collider models to weak-lensing observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) are features in the initial density field that provide a window into the nonlinear dynamics of particles during the inflationary epoch. Among them, a distinctive set of signatures from "cosmological collider physics" originates through interactions of the inflaton with heavy particles active at high energies. The amplitude and form of these signatures depend on the strength and nature of the interactions. The corresponding features in large-scale structure have been studied predominantly through the use of perturbation theory, restricted to the linear regime of the density field. In this work, we implement a method for running cosmological simulations with arbitrary bispectra signals in their initial density field, and produce a simulation suite of over thirty PNG-generating templates, resolving the corresponding collider signatures in the strongly nonlinear regime of the density field. We detail the signals in a variety of late-time measurements -- the matter power spectra, matter bispectra, the halo abundance, and halo bias. We then forecast the potential constraints on the signal amplitudes using weak lensing measurements from the Year-10 dataset of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The second and third moments of the lensing convergence field produce constraints that are competitive and complementary to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background. The data products are publicly released as part of the Ulagam simulation suite. Our initial conditions generator is also publicly available at https://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/Aarambam.</description>

      <title>Primordial Physics in the Nonlinear Universe: signatures of inflationary resonances, excitations, and scale dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) are imprints in the initial density field sourced by the dynamics of inflation. These dynamics can induce scale dependence, oscillations, and other features in the primordial bispectrum. We analyze a suite of over thirty PNG templates, including those used in the _Planck_ analyses of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and resolve their signatures in the deeply nonlinear regime of the late-time density field. Using simulations, we forecast results from a lensing analysis of the Year-10 data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that lensing achieves sensitivity comparable to the CMB for many models, and even surpasses it for templates whose features peak on smaller scales, $k \gtrsim 0.2 h/{\rm Mpc}$. Many templates generate non-monotonic behaviors in mass and length scales, providing a distinct phenomenology in the resulting late-time structure. We simulate, for the first time, resonant signatures consistently in both the primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. The constraints on their amplitudes $(A_{\rm pk}, f_{\rm NL})$ are essentially independent, as each affects structure formation in distinct ways. Overall, we find that lensing data can provide competitive and complementary constraints on these models, and can deliver leading constraints when the primordial features are predominantly on smaller scales. The data products are publicly released as part of the Ulagam simulation suite. Our initial conditions generator is publicly available at https://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/Aarambam.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Analytic Renormalisation of Cosmological Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop contributions to cosmological correlators and to the associated wavefunction are of key theoretical and phenomenological interest. Here, we investigate and compare different renormalisation schemes proposed in the literature to handle ultraviolet divergences and develop new schemes adapting $\eta$ regulators to de Sitter spacetime. We focus on one-loop contributions to the quadratic wavefunction coefficient of a shift-symmetric massless scalar in de Sitter spacetime, which is a good toy model of primordial curvature perturbations. We show that different implementations of dimensional regularisation agree with each other and with unitarity and scale invariance in the final renormalised result. Imposing unitarity in the form of the cosmological optical theorem, we define a class of unitary and analytic $\eta$ regulators that agree with dim reg but feature considerable technical and conceptual simplifications. We show that the imaginary part of all one-loop wavefunction coefficients is universally fixed in terms of the logarithmic running of the real part, under the assumptions of scale invariance, Bunch-Davies vacuum and light bulk fields. Our work resolves discrepancies in the literature, establishes regulator-independent predictions for the imaginary part at one loop, and provides a practical framework for computing quantum contributions to cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Feynman-like parameterizations of (anti-)de Sitter Witten diagrams for all masses at any loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing correlation functions in curved spacetime is central to both theoretical and experimental efforts, from precision cosmology to quantum simulations of strongly coupled systems. In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time correlators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally analogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are significantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators. Existing computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific "conformal" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of standard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic internal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings. We present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation of scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF framework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary internal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly generalizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals, making it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the curved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a generalization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series expansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations. Our results provide a unified computational tool for (A)dS boundary correlators, opening the door to more systematic calculations relevant for upcoming experiments and simulations.</description>

Abstract: We present the spectrum of primordial gravitational wave (GW) expected from the presence of primordial black holes (PBH) and inflaton in the early Universe. For the first time, we combine the waves produced by the PBH decay, with their density fluctuation counterpart, as well as their effects on the GW produced by the inflaton {\it after} (high frequency modes) and {\it before} (low frequency modes) the end of inflation. We generalize our study for a potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^k$ during reheating. We also extend our study, taking into account a possible memory burden effect to see how it can affect the shape of the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low-energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newton's law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are utterly negligible when considering the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop-induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newton's law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa-type deviations and inverse-square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth-force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and future experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. Our results provide a model-independent framework for confronting dark-sector scenarios with precision gravity data, and highlight the complementarity of particle physics and short-distance gravitational tests in probing new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Observational challenges to holographic and Ricci dark energy paradigms: Insights from ACT DR6 and DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that dark energy may be dynamical rather than being a mere cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In this work, we examine the viability of two physically well-motivated dynamical dark energy models -- holographic dark energy (HDE) and Ricci dark energy (RDE) -- by confronting them with the latest observational data, including ACT cosmic microwave background anisotropies, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESY5 supernovae. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w&gt;-1$ at early times to $w&lt;-1$ at late times, while DESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w&gt;-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor. Our results show that the HDE and RDE models remain excluded by the new data, reinforcing earlier conclusions drawn from previous datasets.</description>

Abstract: The $R^2$-Higgs inflation is one of the simplest yet best-fit models consistent with Planck data. The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role. We also show that if the nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Higgs field is $\mathcal{O}(10)$, then preheating via the production of Higgs quanta may help explain the reported observations.</description>

      <title>Mass Lower Bounds for Asymptotically Locally Flat Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish positive mass type theorems for asymptotically locally flat (ALF) manifolds, which have asymptotic ends modeled on circle bundles over a Euclidean base with fibers of constant length. In particular for dimensions $n\leq 7$, the mass of AF manifolds is shown to be nonnegative under the assumption of nonnegative scalar curvature if a codimension-two coordinate sphere in the asymptotic end is trivial in homology, with zero mass achieved only for the product $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\times S^1$. The same conclusions are obtained in dimension four for ALF manifolds admitting an almost free $U(1)$ action. Moreover, in this setting the mass is shown to be bounded below by a multiple of the degree of the circle bundle at infinity. This is the first such result illustrating how nontrivial topology of the end contributes to the mass.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear realisation approach to extended supergravity theories in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the nonlinear realisation approach to spontaneously broken supergravity in three dimensions presented in arXiv:2304.09506. Using this approach we provide a novel derivation of $\mathcal{N}$-extended supergravity, with and without a cosmological term. It corresponds to a St\"uckelberg-type extension of the following theories: (i) the $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) supergravity theories with $p+q=\mathcal{N}$, $p\geq q\geq 0$ proposed by Ach\'ucarro and Townsend; and (ii) the $\mathcal{N}$-extended Poincar\'e supergravity of Marcus and Schwarz. We also apply the approach to obtain a St\"uckelberg reformulation of the supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action for arbitrary $\mathcal{N}$. In our construction, the pure supergravity actions (Poincar\'e and AdS) share the invariance under two different local $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetries. One of them acts on the Goldstini, while the other supersymmetry leaves the Goldstini inert. The $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action proposed in our setting shares the former supersymmetry, but differs in the one that leaves the Goldstini inert. The supersymmetry that acts on the Goldstini can be used to gauge them away, and then the resulting actions coincide with that given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Amplified capture rate of dark matter in compact binaries and constraints on bosonic dark matter from GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accretion of dark matter (DM) onto compact objects and the potential gravitational collapse of neutron stars due to this accretion has become a promising indirect probe of DM properties, complementing terrestrial experiments. We show that the accretion flux of DM on stellar objects is amplified in binary systems due to the complex gravitational interaction of said particles with the binary. We perform few-body Monte Carlo simulations to show that this amplification factor is $\sim4-5$ for circular binaries, small DM velocity dispersions and mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.3$. We use this factor to improve previous constraints on the scattering cross section of non-annihilating bosonic DM with baryonic matter, and derive upper bounds on this cross section from the observation of the binary NS merger associated with GW170817. We also show that the maximally accretable mass fraction of DM by binary NSs is $\lesssim10^{-3}$, even for extreme DM densities only possible in DM spikes, due to the dynamical friction exerted by the ambient DM.</description>

      <title>$\widetilde{W}^{1+}$ subclass: Extending the topological classification of black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify a novel topological subclass, dubbed $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$, in the thermodynamics of higher odd-dimensional, multiply rotating Kerr-AdS black holes. This discovery extends the established topological classification beyond the five classes and two subclasses previously known. The $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$ subclass exhibits a unique and previously unreported stability profile: it admits a thermodynamically stable small black hole state in the low-temperature limit, while in the high-temperature limit, the phase space simultaneously contains one stable large black hole, one stable small black hole, and one unstable small black hole state. Our analysis, which treats black hole solutions as topological defects, reveals a richer landscape of black hole thermodynamics than previously understood and necessitates an expansion of the topological classification scheme to accommodate this new phenomenology.</description>

      <title>PTA Frequency Band Individual Gravitational Wave Sources and Dark Energy Detection Based on Cosmological Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), detectable via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offer a novel avenue to constrain dark energy. Based on cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy formation models, this study explores the detectability of individual nanohertz SMBBH sources using next-generation PTAs and their potential for constraining dark energy under an optimistic scenario considering only the presence of white noise. By constructing light-cone SMBBH populations across hardening timescales ($\tau_H = 0.1/5/10$Gyr) and computing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), we find advanced PTAs can resolve $10^2$--$10^3$ sources with SNR $&gt; 8$ (primarily at $z &lt; 1$ with chirp masses of $10^8$--$10^{10}M_{\odot}$). If electromagnetic counterparts can be identified, optimal configurations ($\sigma_t = 50$ns, $N_p = 1000$, $T_{\text{obs}} = 30$yr with$ \tau_H \leq 5$Gyr) could constrain the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w$ to $\Delta w \sim 0.023$--$0.048$, where the constraints only exhibit weak dependence on $\tau_H$ within $0.1$--$5$Gyr. If only $10\%$ of GW sources have detectable electromagnetic counterparts, constraints weaken to $\Delta w = 0.075$ ($\tau_H = 0.1$Gyr) and $\Delta w = 0.162$ ($\tau_H = 5$Gyr) under the most optimal parameter configuration. What's more, conservative PTAs ($N_p = 500$, $\sigma_t = 100$--$200$ns) with additional $30$-year data accumulation could double resolvable source counts and improve $\Delta w$ precision by $\sim 40\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational physics and astronomy have developed rapidly over the last decade, driven by new observations and theoretical breakthroughs. As new as the science and technology of this field are, its greatest asset may be the body of early-career researchers actively engaged in driving it forward. With the aim of bringing together this community of enthusiastic scientists from a broad array of disciplines, the organisers of the GR-Amaldi meeting joined with the Gravitational-Wave Early Career Scientists organisation to create a three-day event: the Early Career Workshop. The Workshop aimed to provide a broad overview of the field's diverse scientific possibilities and introduce key theoretical foundations underpinning its science. To complement developing technical skills, the Workshop also sought to provide participants with transferable skills to aid them in their future careers. The Workshop emphasized networking and community building, offering participants opportunities to engage with peers and mentors. It encouraged interdisciplinary exchanges and cross-institutional collaboration, fostering connections across different research efforts. Collectively, these initiatives aimed to equip participants with a comprehensive understanding of the field's research and to build a more cohesive, collaborative community of early-career researchers. We summarise key points and conclusion from the carious activities carried out as part of the Workshop.</description>

Abstract: Worldtube excision is a method of reducing computational burden in Numerical Relativity simulations of binary black holes in situations where there is a good analytical model of the geometry around (one or both of) the objects. Two such scenarios of relevance in gravitational-wave astronomy are (1) the case of mass-disparate systems, and (2) the early inspiral when the separation is still large. Here we illustrate the utility and flexibility of this technique with simulations of the fully self-consistent radiative evolution in the model problem of a scalar charge orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole under the effect of scalar-field radiation reaction. We explore a range of orbital configurations, including inspirals with large eccentricity (which we follow through to the final plunge and ringdown) and hyperbolic scattering.</description>

      <title>Causal Classification of Pathological Misner-Type Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00841v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate three causality-violating spacetimes: Misner space (including Kip Thorne's "moving wall" model), the pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, and a new model introduced here, the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime. Despite their different physical origins -- ranging from a flat vacuum solution to a black-hole-type vacuum solution to a non-vacuum model requiring exotic matter -- all three share a common warped-product structure, $2$-dimensional cylindrical base metrics of Eddington-Finkelstein type, and fundamental causal features such as Cauchy and chronology horizons, acausal regions, and analogous geodesic behaviour. Building on a conjecture first proposed in 2016, we present a formal proof that the three models are pairwise isocausal on their universal covers and on suitable causally regular regions of their compactified forms. The proof is constructive, providing explicit causal bijections on the covers and identifying a concrete deck-equivariance criterion governing descent to the compactified spacetimes: if the equivariance degree satisfies $|k|=1$ the models are globally isocausal, whereas if $|k|&gt;1$ or equivariance fails, then at most a one-way causal relation holds between the compactified models. These results supply a rigorous causal classification linking these spacetimes, placing them within a unified Misner-type family and providing a framework for extending the classification to other causality-violating solutions.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Gravities and Equivalence Principle: Foundations and experimental implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The so-called Geometric Trinity of Gravity includes General Relativity (GR), based on spacetime curvature; the Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (TEGR), which relies on spacetime torsion; and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (STEGR), grounded in nonmetricity. Recent studies demonstrate that GR, TEGR, and STEGR are dynamically equivalent, raising questions about the fundamental structure of spacetime, the under-determination of these theories, and whether empirical distinctions among them are possible. The aim of this work is to show that they are equivalent in many features but not exactly in everything. In particular, their relationship with the Equivalence Principle (EP) is different. The EP is a deeply theory-laden assumption, which is assumed as fundamental in constructing GR, with significant implications for our understanding of spacetime. However, it introduces unresolved conceptual issues, including its impact on the nature of the metric and connection, its meaning at the quantum level, tensions with other fundamental interactions and new physics, and its role in dark matter and dark energy problems. In contrast, TEGR and STEGR recover the EP, in particular in its strong formulation, but do not rely on it as a foundational principle. The fact that GR, TEGR, and STEGR are equivalent in non-trivial predictions, but the EP is not necessary for TEGR and STEGR, suggests that it may not be a fundamental feature but an emergent one, potentially marking differences in the empirical content of the three theories. Thus, the developments within the Geometric Trinity framework challenge traditional assumptions about spacetime and may help to better understand some of the unresolved foundational difficulties related to the EP.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior and ultraviolet scaling of induced gravitational waves from an early matter-dominated era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical behavior and ultraviolet scaling of induced gravitational waves (GWs) from an early matter-dominated (eMD) era are studied in the context of primordial black hole evaporation. The depth of the eMD is characterized by the minimum parameter of the equation of state $\omega_{\min}$ that the Universe can attain during this phase. We identify a critical value $\omega_{c}\sim 7.3\times10^{-3}$ that separates two regimes. For $\omega_{\min}&lt;\omega_{c}$, the GW peak lies at the non-linear cut-off point and requires non-linear dynamics. For $\omega_{\min}&gt;\omega_{c}$, the peak originates from modes that reenter near the matter-radiation equality, and the ultraviolet tail follows a distinct scaling $k^{-3/2}$. This critical behavior provides a clear definition of deep versus shallow eMD and a robust spectral signature for future GW observations.</description>

Abstract: Hairy black holes by gravitational decoupling (GD) are probed to derive the gravitational waveform produced by perturbation theory applied to these compact objects. Using the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations governing the metric perturbations and applying a higher-order WKB method, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) are computed and discussed. Compared to the QNMs produced in the ringdown phase of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole solutions, it yields a clear physical signature of primary hair imprinting the hairy GD black hole gravitational waveforms.</description>

Abstract: We present the public release of the low-frequency atlas of continuous gravitational waves, covering signals with frequencies from 20 Hz to 200 Hz and frequency derivatives from -5e-11 to 5e-11 Hz/s. Compared to the previous atlas releases, this version demonstrates significant improvements in sensitivity and sky resolution. In the most sensitive region even the worst-case upper limits on gravitational wave strain are below 1e-25. The atlas data is being released ahead of the completion of the full follow-up analysis.</description>

      <title>Investigating Hardware Injections in LIGO O3 Data: Simulated Signals from a Neutron Star in a Low-Mass X-ray Binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA s third observing run (O3), simulated continuous gravitational wave (CW) signals were added to the added to the LIGO detectors as hardware (HW) injections, which are physical injections into the interferometer control loop via auxiliary laser actuation on test-mass mirrors. These included two periodic signals mimicking a spinning neutron star in a binary system, similar to the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1). HW injections serve as an important validation of a search method, as they occur before data cleaning and preparation. We searched for these injections using the model-based cross-correlation pipeline, which was used to search for CWs from Sco X-1 in the first three LVK observing runs. To simulate a realistic search, we used a search region of orbital parameter space of similar size to the plausible parameter ranges for Sco X-1, but containing the parameters of each HW injection. Our self-blinded analysis confidently detected one of the injections. The other, which was generated with a lower amplitude and in a more expensive region of frequency space, was not detected. We verified the imprint of this second signal by performing a deeper targeted search at its true parameters. However, such a deep search across the full parameter range would have been computationally infeasible.</description>

Abstract: Investigation of neutrino spin oscillation in the gravitational fields of black holes (BHs) is one of the interesting topics in neutrino physics. On the other hand, in recent years, many studies have been devoted to the exploration of different physical phenomena in higher dimensions. Non-commutative geometry has also been focus of researchers in recent years to explore the structure of space-time more deeply and accurately. In this work, the neutrino spin oscillation in the non-commutative higher dimensional gravitational fields of Schwarzschild and Reissner Nordstrom metrics is studied. The effects of noncommutativity of space are calculated and its role in different dimensions is discussed. Considering the fact that in the non-commutative space, for certain values of eta, no event horizon exists and consequently, there will be no BH, some upper bounds for the non-commutative parameter are obtained.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Axion-like Curvaton: Non-Gaussianity and Primordial Black Holes Without Large Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that does not require specific features in the inflationary potential, revisiting previous literature. In this mechanism, a light spectator field evolves stochastically during inflation and remains subdominant during the post-inflationary era. Even though the curvature power spectrum stays small at all scales, rare perturbations of the field probe a local maximum in its potential, leading to non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of curvature fluctuations, and to copious PBH production. For a concrete axion-like particle (ALP) scenario we analytically determine the distribution of the compaction function for perturbations, showing that it is characterized by a heavy tail, which produces an extended PBH mass distribution. We find the ALP mass and decay constant to be correlated with the PBH mass, for instance, an ALP with a mass $m_a = 5.4 \times 10^{14}$ eV and a decay constant $f_a = 4.6 \times 10^{-5} Mpl$ can lead to PBHs of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{21}$ g as the entire dark matter (DM) of the universe, and is testable in future PBH observations via lensing in the NGRST and mergers detectable in the LISA and ET Gravitational Waves (GW) detectors. We then extend our analysis to mixed ALP and PBH dark matter and Higgs-like spectator fields. We find that PBHs cluster strongly over all cosmological scales, clashing with CMB isocurvature bounds. We argue that this problem is shared by all PBH production from inflationary models that depend solely on large non-Gaussianity without a peak in the curvature power spectrum and discuss possible remedies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure, aka causal spacetimes satisfying the ``no observer horizons'' condition. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometry group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Anchors no more: Using peculiar velocities to constrain $H_0$ and the primordial Universe without calibrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the primordial power spectrum amplitude $A_\mathrm{s}$ using type Ia supernovae (SNIa) data. By considering SNIa as tracers of the peculiar velocity field, we can model their distance and their covariance as a function of cosmological parameters without the need of calibrators like Cepheids; this yields a new independent probe of the large-scale structure based on SNIa data without distance anchors. Crucially, we implement a differentiable pipeline in JAX, including efficient emulators and affine sampling, reducing inference time from years to hours on a single GPU. We first validate our method on mock datasets, demonstrating that we can constrain $H_0$ and $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ within $10\%$ and $15\%$, respectively, using $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ SNIa. We then test our pipeline with SNIa from an $N$-body simulation, obtaining $6\%$-level unbiased constraints on $H_0$ with a moderate noise level. We finally apply our method to Pantheon+ data, constraining $H_0$ at the $15\%$ level without Cepheids when fixing $A_\mathrm{s}$ to its $\it{Planck}$ value. On the other hand, we obtain $20\%$-level constraints on $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ in agreement with $\it{Planck}$ when including Cepheids in the analysis. In light of upcoming observations of low redshift SNIa from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, surveys for which our method will develop its full potential, we make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Holographic timelike entanglement in AdS$_{3}$ Vaidya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the studies of pseudo-entropy in de Sitter, there have been recent proposals for a timelike entanglement in AdS/CFT. In this work, we explore this proposal in the context of a holographic CFT undergoing a global quench. We study various cases in which the timelike intervals are anchored at various boundary times, sometimes straddling the infalling shell. The early and late time behaviours reproduce the known results coming from the pure AdS and the black hole geometry dual to the thermal CFT state respectively. However when the infalling shock straddles the timelike interval, the dynamics drastically differs from how the entanglement entropy evolves.</description>

      <title>Warming up the Fibres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux compactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the cosmological observations under appropriate choices of parameters, which originate from their string theory construction. In the present work, we embed such models, originally studied in the cold inflation picture, in the context of warm inflation. We study the viability of different fibre inflation potentials in both strong and weak dissipative regime of warm inflation. In fibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre of a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an interplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The former type of corrections consists of leading-order $\alpha'^3-$ term, higher derivative $F^4-$ correction, and various string loop corrections of KK, log-loop and winding type. Depending on the balance between several corrections, we present four different fibre inflationary potentials and show that the warm inflationary pictures for all of them can successfully fall in the viable window from both Planck and recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of parameters of applicability of these models. Our results also indicate that with the help of a large dissipation ratio, one can achieve a sub-Planckian field excursion, although, this runs on the possibility of moving away from the perturbative control of low-energy four-dimensional supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Learning and Interpreting Gravitational-Wave Features from CNNs with a Random Forest Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely adopted in gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw strain data. However, the physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF) classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method introduces four physically interpretable metrics - variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude - computed from the final convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output in the RF classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline CNN model, achieving a relative improvement of 21\% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10 events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals (SNR $\le$ 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy environments. Feature attribution via the RF model reveals that both CNN-extracted and handcrafted features contribute significantly to classification decisions, with learned variance and CNN outputs ranked among the most informative. These findings suggest that physically motivated post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep learning and domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Emulating compact binary population synthesis simulations with uncertainty quantification and model comparison using Bayesian normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations can be costly to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can emulate population synthesis runs to enable simulation-based inference from observed catalogs and data augmentation for feature prediction in rarely synthesizable sub-populations. However, flow predictions can be wrought with uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work, we develop a method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by implementing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function naturally associated with density estimators, we sample the posterior distribution of flow parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow uncertainties. We demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, inference, and data-augmentation impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution. We outline the applications of the proposed methodology in the context of simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and feature prediction, with state-of-the-art binary evolution simulators, now marginalized over model and data uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Behaviour of $\alpha$-attractors in Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation have remained one of the preferred inflationary models for nearly a decade now. The unique attractor nature of these models in the $n_s-r$ plane have put these models in the sweet-spot of the $n_s-r$ measurement of Planck observations. In this article, we analyse the behaviour of such attractor models in a Warm Inflation setup to investigate whether the attractor nature of these models can be retained even when the dynamics deviates from the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. We have chosen to analyse these models in a strongly dissipative Warm inflation setup, namely the Minimal Warm Inflation, as in such a setup the inflationary dynamics significantly departs from the standard Cold inflation dynamics. We observe that the departure from the standard Cold inflation dynamics destroys the unique attractor nature of such models. The analysis clearly indicates that the attractor nature of these $\alpha$-attractor models is quite unique to the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. However, on a positive note, the analysis indicates that the $\alpha$-attractor models may be made in tune with the recent ACT results in Warm inflation for certain parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Two Dynamical Scenarios for Binned Master Sample Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze two different scenarios for the late Universe dynamics, resulting into Hubble parameters deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM, mainly for the presence of an additional free parameter, which is the dark energy parameter. The first model consists of a pure evolutionary dark energy paradigm, as result of its creation by the gravitational field of the expanding Universe. The second model also considers an interaction of the evolutionary dark energy with the matter component, postulated via the conservation of the sum of their ideal energy-momentum tensors. These two models are then compared \textit{via} the diagnostic tool of the effective running Hubble constant, with the binned data of the so-called ``Master sample'' for the Type Ia Supernovae. The comparison procedures, based on a standard MCMC analysis, led to a clear preference of data for the dark energy - matter interaction model, which is associated to a phantom matter equation of state parameter (very close to $-1$) when, being left free by data (it has a flat posterior), it is fixed in order to reproduce the decreasing power-law behavior of the effective running Hubble constant, already discussed in literature.</description>

      <title>How many pixels are there in a polarized pulsar timing array map?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to searching for gravitational wave signatures in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has been to compare the theoretical Hellings and Downs (HD) curve with the observed correlations in pulsar timing residuals as a function of angular separation on the sky between pulsar pairs. While this approach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of nanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any directional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the gravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the gravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple quadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction on the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this way, we describe the full, $S_2 \times S_2$, state-space of a polarized gravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\'e sphere describing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what is the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent pixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct gravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the answer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\rm res} = 16 \times 2 = 32$ per frequency, where 16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct polarization states. This corresponds to an angular resolution of $58^\circ$, which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\rm pulsar} \gtrsim 20$ pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is equivalent to the HD significance, while for a single point source, a 3-$\sigma$ HD signal corresponds to a 5.2-$\sigma$ map significance.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of the divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of the curvature parameter and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Embedding Signature-Changing Manifolds: A Braneworld and Kaluza-Klein Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of semi-Riemannian manifolds characterized by smooth metric signature changes with a transverse radical. This class includes spacetimes relevant to cosmological models such as the Hartle-Hawking "no boundary" proposal, where a Riemannian manifold transitions smoothly into a Lorentzian spacetime without boundaries or singularities. For this class, we prove the existence of global isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces. We then strengthen this result by demonstrating that a specific type of global isometric embedding, which we term an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding, also exists into both Minkowski space and Misner space. For the canonical $n$-dimensional signature-changing model, we explicitly construct a full global isometric embedding into $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski and Misner spaces, a significantly stronger result than an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding for this specific case.
  This embedding framework provides new geometric tools for studying signature change and braneworlds through the geometry of submanifolds embedded in a bulk, thus presenting a mathematically well-defined approach to these phenomena.</description>
