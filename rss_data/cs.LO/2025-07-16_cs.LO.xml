      <title>$\epsilon$-Distance via L\'evy-Prokhorov Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most studied and accepted pseudometric for probabilistic processes is one based on the Kantorovich distance between distributions. It comes with many theoretical and motivating results, in particular it is the fixpoint of a given functional and defines a functor on (complete) pseudometric spaces.
  Other notions of behavioural pseudometrics have also been proposed, one of them ($\epsilon$-distance) based on $\epsilon$-bisimulation. $\epsilon$-Distance has the advantages that it is intuitively easy to understand, it relates systems that are conceptually close (for example, an imperfect implementation is close to its specification), and it comes equipped with a natural notion of $\epsilon$-coupling. Finally, this distance is easy to compute.
  We show that $\epsilon$-distance is also the greatest fixpoint of a functional and provides a functor. The latter is obtained by replacing the Kantorovich distance in the lifting functor with the L\'evy-Prokhorov distance. In addition, we show that $\epsilon$-couplings and $\epsilon$-bisimulations have an appealing coalgebraic characterization.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Medical Triage Optimization with Logic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a logic programming framework that orchestrates multiple variants of an optimization problem and reasons about their results to support high-stakes medical decision-making. The logic programming layer coordinates the construction and evaluation of multiple optimization formulations, translating solutions into logical facts that support further symbolic reasoning and ensure efficient resource allocation-specifically targeting the "right patient, right platform, right escort, right time, right destination" principle. This capability is integrated into GuardianTwin, a decision support system for Forward Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), where rapid and explainable resource allocation is critical. Through a series of experiments, our framework demonstrates an average reduction in casualties by 35.75 % compared to standard baselines. Additionally, we explore how users engage with the system via an intuitive interface that delivers explainable insights, ultimately enhancing decision-making in critical situations. This work demonstrates how logic programming can serve as a foundation for modular, interpretable, and operationally effective optimization in mission-critical domains.</description>

      <title>Execution and monitoring of HOA automata with HOAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tool called Hoax for the execution of {\omega}-automata expressed in the popular HOA format. The tool leverages the notion of trap sets to enable runtime monitoring of any (non-parity) acceptance condition supported by the format. When the automaton is not monitorable, the tool may still be able to recognise so-called ugly prefixes, and determine that no further observation will ever lead to a conclusive verdict. The tool is open-source and highly configurable. We present its formal foundations, its design, and compare it against the trace analyser PyContract on a lock acquisition scenario.</description>

      <title>Interpolation and Quantifiers in Ortholattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantifiers and interpolation properties in \emph{orthologic}, a non-distributive weakening of classical logic that is sound for formula validity with respect to classical logic, yet has a quadratic-time decision procedure. We present a sequent-based proof system for quantified orthologic, which we prove sound and complete for the class of all complete ortholattices. We show that orthologic does not admit quantifier elimination in general. Despite that, we show that interpolants always exist in orthologic. We give an algorithm to compute interpolants efficiently. We expect our result to be useful to quickly establish unreachability as a component of verification algorithms.</description>

      <title>LISA -- A Modern Proof System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LISA, a proof system and proof assistant for constructing proofs in schematic first-order logic and axiomatic set theory. The logical kernel of the system is a proof checker for first-order logic with equality and schematic predicate and function symbols. It implements polynomial-time proof checking and uses the axioms of ortholattices (which implies the irrelevance of the order of conjuncts and disjuncts and additional propositional laws). The kernel supports the notion of theorems (whose proofs are not expanded), as well as definitions of predicate symbols and objects whose unique existence is proven. A domain-specific language enables construction of proofs and development of proof tactics with user-friendly tools and presentation, while remaining within the general-purpose language, Scala. We describe the LISA proof system and illustrate the flavour and the level of abstraction of proofs written in LISA. This includes a proof-generating tactic for propositional tautologies, leveraging the ortholattice properties to reduce the size of proofs. We also present early formalization of set theory in LISA, including Cantor's theorem.</description>

      <title>Cancellative Convex Semilattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex semilattices are algebras that are at the same time a convex algebra and a semilattice, together with a distributivity axiom. These algebras have attracted some attention in the last years as suitable algebras for probability and nondeterminism, in particular by being the Eilenberg-Moore algebras of the nonempty finitely-generated convex subsets of the distributions monad.
  A convex semilattice is cancellative if the underlying convex algebra is cancellative. Cancellative convex algebras have been characterized by M. H. Stone and by H. Kneser: A convex algebra is cancellative if and only if it is isomorphic to a convex subset of a vector space (with canonical convex algebra operations).
  We prove an analogous theorem for convex semilattices: A convex semilattice is cancellative if and only if it is isomorphic to a convex subset of a Riesz space, i.e., a lattice-ordered vector space (with canonical convex semilattice operations).</description>

      <title>Path-filtration for modal logics applied to revisiting quasi-dense logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10094 (also published at LICS'24 conference), Lyon and Ostropolski-Nalewaja answer the question of the decidability of quasi-dense modallogics, and give an upper bound in EXPSPACE. Unfortunately, their intricate proof contains a major flaw that cannot be fixed, leaving the question wide open. In this paper we provide a correct and rather simple and direct proof of it by introducing a new variant of the well-know filtration method based on paths in a canonical model and improve the hypothetical membership to membership NEXPTIME.</description>

      <title>SC-TPTP: An Extension of the TPTP Derivation Format for Sequent-Based Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the transfer of proofs between proof systems, and in particular from first order automated theorem provers (ATPs) to interactive theorem provers (ITPs), we specify an extension of the TPTP derivation text format to describe proofs in first-order logic: SC-TPTP. To avoid multiplication of standards, our proposed format over-specifies the TPTP derivation format by focusing on sequent formalisms. By doing so, it provides a high level of detail, is faithful to mathematical tradition, and cover multiple existing tools and in particular tableaux-based strategies. We make use of this format to allow the Lisa proof assistant to query the Go\'eland automated theorem prover, and implement a library of tools able to parse, print and check SC-TPTP proofs, export them into Coq files, and rebuild low-level proof steps from advanced ones.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Timing Analysis of Digital Integrated Circuits in Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum delay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is crucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an Arithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to perform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger, synchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum clock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static Timing Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can be determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead to suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum delay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally hard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring extremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem into ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address complex problems in hardware design.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Skolem Problem at Low Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) $\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ over the integers has a zero term, that is, whether there exists $n$ such that $u_n = 0$. Decidability of the problem is open in general, with the most notable positive result being a decision procedure for LRS of order at most 4.
  In this paper we consider a bounded version of the Skolem Problem, in which the input consists of an LRS $\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ and a bound $N \in \mathbb N$ (with all integers written in binary), and the task is to determine whether there exists $n\in\{0,\ldots,N\}$ such that $u_n=0$. We give a randomised algorithm for this problem that, for all $d\in \mathbb N$, runs in polynomial time on the class of LRS of order at most $d$. As a corollary we show that the (unrestricted) Skolem Problem for LRS of order at most 4 lies in $\mathsf{coRP}$, improving the best previous upper bound of $\mathsf{NP}^{\mathsf{RP}}$.
  The running time of our algorithm is exponential in the order of the LRS -- a dependence that appears necessary in view of the $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness of the Bounded Skolem Problem. However, even for LRS of a fixed order, the problem involves detecting zeros within an exponentially large range. For this, our algorithm relies on results from $p$-adic analysis to isolate polynomially many candidate zeros and then test in randomised polynomial time whether each candidate is an actual zero by reduction to arithmetic-circuit identity testing.</description>

Abstract: After a concise introduction to the square of opposition, in particular, and, Aristotelian Diagrams, in general, I describe how one can create a mathematical universe to host these objects. Since these objects assume that the underlying logic is the bivalent logic, I have used these objects as a starting point to introduce fuzzy Aristotelian Diagrams and describe a mathematical formulation of them. In addition, I outline the characteristrics of a mathematical universe that hosts them.</description>

      <title>The Modal Cube Revisited: Semantics without Worlds (Technical Report)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-deterministic semantic framework for all modal logics in the modal cube, extending prior works by Kearns and others. Our approach introduces modular and uniform multi-valued non-deterministic matrices (Nmatrices) for each logic, where necessitation is captured by the systematic use of level valuations. The semantics is grounded in an eight-valued system and provides a sound and complete decision procedure for each modal logic, extending and refining earlier semantics as particular cases. Additionally, we propose a novel model-theoretic perspective that links our framework to relational (Kripke-style) semantics, addressing longstanding conjectures regarding the correspondence between modal axioms and semantic conditions within non-deterministic settings. The result is a philosophically robust and technically modular alternative to standard possible-world semantics.</description>

      <title>Semi-Competitive Differential Game Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces semi-competitive differential game logic dGLsc, which enables verification of safety-critical applications that involve interactions between two agents. In dGLsc, these interactions are specified as games on hybrid systems with two players that may collaborate with each other when helpful and may compete when necessary. The players in the hybrid games of dGLsc have individual goals that may overlap, leading to nonzero-sum games. This makes dGLsc especially well-suited for verifying situations where players, e.g., share safety objectives but otherwise pursue different goals, so that zero-sum assumptions lead to overly conservative results. Additionally, dGLsc solves the subtlety that even though each player may benefit from knowledge of the other player's goals, e.g., concerning shared safety objectives, unsafe situations might still occur if every player were to mutually assume the other player would act to avoid unsafety. The syntax and semantics, as well as a sound and relatively complete proof calculus are presented for dGLsc. The relationship between dGLsc and zero-sum differential game logic dGL is discussed and the purpose of dGLsc illustrated in a canonical example.</description>

      <title>Effective weak convergence and tightness of measures in computable Polish spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prokhorov's Theorem in probability theory states that a family $\Gamma$ of probability measures on a Polish space is tight if and only if every sequence in $\Gamma$ has a weakly convergent subsequence. Due to the highly non-constructive nature of (relative) sequential compactness, however, the effective content of this theorem has not been studied. To this end, we generalize the effective notions of weak convergence of measures on the real line due to McNicholl and Rojas to computable Polish spaces. Then, we introduce an effective notion of tightness for families of measures on computable Polish spaces. Finally, we prove an effective version of Prokhorov's Theorem for computable sequences of probability measures.</description>

      <title>The structure of polynomial growth for tree automata/transducers and MSO set queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an $\mathbb{N}$-weighted tree automaton, we give a decision procedure for exponential vs polynomial growth (with respect to the input size) in quadratic time, and an algorithm that computes the exact polynomial degree of growth in cubic time. As a special case, they apply to the growth of the ambiguity of a nondeterministic tree automaton, i.e. the number of distinct accepting runs over a given input. Our time complexities match the recent fine-grained lower bounds for these problems restricted to ambiguity of word automata.
  We deduce analogous decidability results (ignoring complexity) for the growth of the number of results of set queries in Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO) over ranked trees. In the case of polynomial growth of degree $k$, we also prove a reparameterization theorem for such queries: their results can be mapped to $k$-tuples of input nodes in a finite-to-one and MSO-definable fashion.
  This property of MSO set queries leads directly to a generalization of the dimension minimization theorem for string-to-string polyregular functions. Our generalization applies to MSO set interpretations from trees, which subsume (as we show) tree-walking tree transducers and invisible pebble tree-to-string transducers. Finally, with a bit more work we obtain the following:
  * a new, short and conceptual proof that macro tree transducers of linear growth compute only tree-to-tree MSO transductions;
  * a procedure to decide polynomial size-to-height increase for both macro tree transducers and MSO set interpretations, and compute the degree.
  The paper concludes with a survey of a wide range of related work, with over a hundred references.</description>

      <title>On Complementation of Nondeterministic Finite Automata without Full Determinization (Technical Report)</title>

Abstract: Complementation of finite automata is a basic operation used in numerous applications. The standard way to complement a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) is to transform it into an equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and complement the DFA. The DFA can, however, be exponentially larger than the corresponding NFA. In this paper, we study several alternative approaches to complementation, which are based either on reverse powerset construction or on two novel constructions that exploit a commonly occurring structure of NFAs. Our experiment on a large data set shows that using a different than the classical approach can in many cases yield significantly smaller complements.</description>
