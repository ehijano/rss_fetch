      <title>An introduction to representations of p-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit understanding of the (category of all smooth, complex) representations of p-adic groups provides an important tool not just within representation theory. It also has applications to number theory and other areas, and, in particular, it enables progress on various different forms of the Langlands program. In this write-up of the author's ECM 2024 colloquium-style talk, we will introduce p-adic groups and explain how the category of representations of p-adic groups decomposes into subcategories, called Bernstein blocks. We also provide an overview of what we know about the structure of these Bernstein blocks including a sketch of recent results of the author with Adler, Mishra and Ohara that allow to reduce a lot of problems about the (category of) representations of p-adic groups to problems about representations of finite groups of Lie type, where answers are often already known or are at least easier to achieve. Moreover, we provide an overview of what is known about the construction of supercuspidal representations, which are the building blocks of all smooth representations and whose construction is also the key to obtain the above results about the structure of the whole category of smooth representations. We will, in particular, focus on recent advances which include the work of the author mentioned in the EMS prize citation as well as a hint towards her recent joint work with David Schwein.</description>

      <title>Stability Conditions and Algebraic Hearts for Acyclic Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stability conditions on the derived category of a finite connected acyclic quiver. We prove that, for any stability condition on the derived category, its heart can be obtained from an algebraic heart by a rotation of phases. Consequently, we establish the connectedness of the space of stability conditions. Furthermore, we prove that every stability condition $\sigma$ admits a full $\sigma$-exceptional collection.</description>

      <title>On character tables for fusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A character table $X$ for a saturated fusion system $\mathcal{F}$ on a finite $p$-group $S$ is the square matrix of values associated to a basis of virtual $\mathcal{F}$-stable ordinary characters of $S$. We investigate a conjecture of the second author which equates the $p$-part of $|\det(X)|^2$ with the product of the orders of $S$-centralisers of fully $\mathcal{F}$-centralised $\mathcal{F}$-class representatives. This statement is exactly column orthogonality for the character table of $S$ when $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_S(S)$. We prove the conjecture when $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_S(G)$ is realised by some finite group $G$ with Sylow $p$-subgroup $S$, and for all simple fusion systems when $|S| \le p^4$.</description>

      <title>On norms on Harish-Chandra modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casselman-Wallach theorem is a foundational result in the theory of representations of real reductive groups connecting algebraic representations to topological representations. We provide a quantitative version of this theorem. For that we introduce the notion of {\it Sobolev gap} for a Harish-Chandra module. This is a new invariant whose finiteness is highly non-trivial. We determine the Sobolev gap for representations in the unitary dual of the group $\SL(2,\R)$ and establish uniform finiteness results in general for representations of the discrete series and the minimal principal series. We use these notions to reformulate and extend classical results of Bernstein and Reznikov concerning automorphic functionals with respect to cocompact lattices. In particular, we prove an abstract convexity bound which applies to automorphic functionals with respect to general lattices in $\SL(2,\R)$ and is independent of the type of unitarizable irreducible Harish-Chandra module. Finally, we offer an extensive list of open problems.</description>

Abstract: We prove the motivic classes in the motivic cohomology groups of Picard modular surfaces with non-trivial coefficients constructed in a paper of Loeffler\textendash Skinner\textendash Zerbes are in the motivic cohomology groups of the interior motives. Then we establish a relation between the motivic classes and non-critical values of the motivic $L$-functions associated to cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GU}(2,1)$, thus deducing non-triviality of the motivic classes and providing evidence for Beilinson's conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define quantum deformations of Adams operations in $K$-theory, in the framework of quasimap quantum $K$-theory. They provide $K$-theoretic analogs of the quantum Steenrod operations from equivariant symplectic Gromov--Witten theory. We verify the compatibility of these operations with the Kahler and equivariant $q$-difference module structures, provide sample computations via $\mathbb{Z}/k$-equivariant localization, and identify them with $p$-curvature operators of the Kahler $q$-difference connections as studied in Koroteev-Smirnov. We also formulate and verify a $K$-theoretic quantum Hikita conjecture at roots of unity, and propose an indirect algebro-geometric definition of quantum Steenrod operations</description>

      <title>Intersection cohomology without spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</description>

      <title>$H$-Equivariant Morita equivalences of Loewy-graded comodule algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a coradically graded Hopf algebra. For every Loewy-graded exact $H$-comodule algebra $A=\oplus_{n\geq 0} A(n)$ and $H_0$-equivariant Morita equivalence $A(0)\simeq_{H_0} X$, there exists a Loewy-graded $H$-comodule algebra $B$ (isomorphic to $X$ in degree zero) realizing an $H$-equivariant Morita equivalence $A\simeq_H B$. In addition, if every exact $H_0$-comodule algebra is $H_0$-equivariant Morita equivalent to a coideal subalgebra of $H_0$, then every Loewy-graded exact $H$-comodule algebra is $H$-equivariant Morita equivalent to a coideal subalgebra of $H$. We also discuss Loewy-graded $H$-comodule algebras with $H_0=\mathcal{KP}$, the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Bounds of restriction of characters to submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03178v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fruitful approach to studying the concentration of Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions on a compact manifold, as the eigenvalue tends to infinity, is to bound their restriction to submanifolds. In this paper, we adopt this approach in the setting of compact Lie groups and provide sharp restriction bounds for general Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions, as well as for important special cases such as sums of matrix coefficients and, in particular, characters of irreducible representations. We prove sharp asymptotic $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of general Laplace--Beltrami eigenfunctions to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds, for all $p \geq 2$. Furthermore, we establish sharp asymptotic $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of characters to maximal tori and all of their submanifolds for all $p&gt;0$, and to torus-generated conjugation-invariant submanifolds for all $p \geq 2$. We also obtain sharp $L^p$ bounds for the restriction of general sums of matrix coefficients to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds, for all $p \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Reality determining subgraphs and strongly real modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of pseudo q-factorization graphs was recently introduced by the last two authors as a combinatorial language which is suited for capturing certain properties of Drinfeld polynomials. Using certain known representation theoretic facts about tensor products of Kirillov Reshetikhin modules and qcharacters, combined with special topological/combinatorial properties of the underlying q-factorization graphs, the last two authors showed that, for algebras of type A, modules associated to totally ordered graphs are prime, while those associated to trees are real. In this paper, we extend the latter result. We introduce the notions of strongly real modules and that of trees of modules satisfying certain properties. In particular, we can consider snake trees, i.e., trees formed from snake modules. Among other results, we show that a certain class of such generalized trees, which properly contains the snake trees, give rise to strongly real modules.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$-character stacks and Langlands duality over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03234v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the mixed Poincar\'e polynomial of generic $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$-character stacks with coefficients in some local systems arising from the conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ which have non-connected stabiliser. We give a conjectural formula that we prove to be true under the Euler specialisation. We then prove that this conjectured formula interpolates the structure coefficients of the two based rings$ \left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)),Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_n),*\right)$ and $\left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)), CS(\mathrm{SL}_n),\cdot\right) $ where for a group $H$, $\mathcal{C}(H)$ denotes the space of complex valued class functions on $H$, $Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_n)$ denotes the basis of characteristic functions of intermediate extensions of equivariant local systems on conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PGL}_n$ and $CS(\mathrm{SL}_n)$ the basis of characteristic functions of Lusztig's character-sheaves on $\mathrm{SL}_n$. Our result reminds us of a non-abelian Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Potent categorical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and motivate -- based on ongoing joint work with Germ\'an Stefanich -- the notion of potent categorical representations of a complex reductive group $G$, specifically a conjectural Langlands correspondence identifying potent categorical representations of $G$ and its Langlands dual $\check G$. We emphasize the symplectic nature of potent categorical representations in their simultaneous dependence on parameters in maximal tori for $G$ and $\check G$, specifically how their conjectural Langlands correspondence fits within a 2-categorical Fourier transform. Our key tool to make various ideas precise is higher sheaf theory and its microlocalization, specifically a theory of ind-coherent sheaves of categories on stacks. The constructions are inspired by the physics of 3d mirror symmetry and S-duality on the one hand, and the theory of double affine Hecke algebras on the other. We also highlight further conjectures related to ongoing programs in and around geometric representation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The involutory subalgebra K(E$_9$) of the affine Kac-Moody algebra E$_9$ was recently shown to admit an infinite sequence of unfaithful representations of ever increasing dimensions arXiv:2102.00870. We revisit these representations and describe their associated ideals in more detail, with particular emphasis on two chiral versions that can be constructed for each such representation. For every such unfaithful representation we show that the action of K(E$_9$) decomposes into a direct sum of two mutually commuting (`chiral' and `anti-chiral') parabolic algebras with Levi subalgebra $\mathfrak{so}(16)_+\,\oplus\,\mathfrak{so}(16)_-$. We also spell out the consistency conditions for uplifting such representations to unfaithful representations of K(E$_{10}$). From these results it is evident that the holonomy groups so far discussed in the literature are mere shadows (in a Platonic sense) of a much larger structure.</description>

      <title>$\hbar$-Vertex algebras and chiralization of star products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of $\hbar$-vertex algebras, algebraic structures closely related to vertex algebras but with a deformed translation covariance axiom. We establish their structure theory, including analogues of Goddard's Uniqueness Theorem, the Reconstruction Theorem, Borcherds Identity, and the OPE Expansion Formula, and introduce the associated notions of $\hbar$-Lie conformal and $\hbar$-Poisson vertex algebras. The formalism provides a natural and simplified construction of the Zhu algebra. The main application is to the chiralization of classical star-products: we show that every star-product on the symmetric algebra of a Lie algebra (or its central extensions) admits a chiralization, and we derive explicit formulae for these chiral star-products, including the Moyal-Weyl and Gutt star-products. Setting $\hbar=0$ recovers explicit deformation quantizations of a broad class of Poisson vertex algebras, including the classical limits of free-boson, $\beta \gamma$-system, affine, and Virasoro vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>The Negation Of Singer's Conjecture For The Sixth Algebraic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09455v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6,6+36).$</description>
