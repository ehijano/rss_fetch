      <title>Bounding irrelevant operators in the 3d Gross-Neveu-Yukawa CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a numerical bootstrap study of scalar operators in the critical 3d Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models, a family of conformal field theories containing N Majorana fermions in the fundamental representation of an O(N) global symmetry. We compute rigorous bounds on the scaling dimensions of the next-to-lowest parity-even and parity-odd singlet scalars at N = 2, 4, and 8. All of these dimensions have lower bounds greater than 3, implying that there are only two relevant singlet scalars and placing constraints on the RG flow structure of these theories.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting the scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions II: a relativistic lattice field theory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In present work, a relativistic relation that connects the difference of interacting and non-interacting integrated two-particle correlation functions in finite volume to infinite volume scattering phase shift through an integral is derived. We show that the difference of integrated finite volume correlation functions converge rapidly to its infinite volume limit as the size of periodic box is increased. The fast convergence of our proposed formalism is illustrated by analytic solutions of a contact interaction model, the perturbation theory calculation, and also Monte Carlo simulation of a complex $\phi^4$ lattice field theory model.</description>

      <title>Spin exchange-enabled quantum simulator for large-scale non-Abelian gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central requirement for the faithful implementation of large-scale lattice gauge theories (LGTs) on quantum simulators is the protection of the underlying gauge symmetry. Recent advancements in the experimental realizations of large-scale LGTs have been impressive, albeit mostly restricted to Abelian gauge groups. Guided by this requirement for gauge protection, we propose an experimentally feasible approach to implement large-scale non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{U}(N)$ LGTs with dynamical matter in $d+1$D, enabled by two-body spin-exchange interactions realizing local emergent gauge-symmetry stabilizer terms. We present two concrete proposals for $2+1$D $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{U}(2)$ LGTs, including dynamical bosonic matter and induced plaquette terms, that can be readily implemented in current ultracold-molecule and next-generation ultracold-atom platforms. We provide numerical benchmarks showcasing experimentally accessible dynamics, and demonstrate the stability of the underlying non-Abelian gauge invariance. We develop a method to obtain the effective gauge-invariant model featuring the relevant magnetic plaquette and minimal gauge-matter coupling terms. Our approach paves the way towards near-term realizations of large-scale non-Abelian quantum link models in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Relativistic model-free prediction for neutrinoless double beta decay at leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a manifestly Lorentz-invariant chiral Lagrangian, we present a model-free prediction for the transition amplitude of the process $nn\rightarrow pp e^-e^-$ induced by light Majorana neutrinos, which is a key process of the neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in heavy nuclei employed in large-scale searches. Contrary to the nonrelativistic case, we show that the transition amplitude can be renormalized at leading order without any uncertain contact operators. The predicted amplitude defines a stringent benchmark for the previous estimation with model-dependent inputs, and greatly reduces the uncertainty of $0\nu\beta\beta$ transition operator in the calculations of nuclear matrix elements. Generalizations of the present framework could also help to address the uncertainties in $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay induced by other mechanisms. In addition, the present work motivates a relativistic {\it ab initio} calculation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in light and medium-mass nuclei.</description>

      <title>Learning PDFs through Interpretable Latent Representations in Mellin Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representing the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton and other hadrons through flexible, high-fidelity parametrizations has been a long-standing goal of particle physics phenomenology. This is particularly true since the chosen parametrization methodology can play an influential role in the ultimate PDF uncertainties as extracted in QCD global analyses; these, in turn, are often determinative of the reach of experiments at the LHC and other facilities to non-standard physics, including at large $x$, where parametrization effects can be significant. In this study, we explore a series of encoder-decoder machine-learning (ML) models with various neural-network topologies as efficient means of reconstructing PDFs from meaningful information stored in an interpretable latent space. Given recent effort to pioneer synergies between QCD analyses and lattice-gauge calculations, we formulate a latent representation based on the behavior of PDFs in Mellin space, i.e., their integrated moments, and test the ability of various models to decode PDFs from this information faithfully. We introduce a numerical package, $\texttt{PDFdecoder}$, which implements several encoder-decoder models to reconstruct PDFs with high fidelity and use this tool to explore strengths and pitfalls of neural-network approaches to PDF parametrization. We additionally dissect patterns of learned correlations between encoded Mellin moments and reconstructed PDFs which suggest opportunities for further improvements to ML-based approaches to PDF parametrizations and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the leading order coupling of double-heavy hadrons to heavy hadron pairs in Born-Oppenheimer effective field theory. We obtain the expressions for the contribution of heavy hadron pairs to the masses and widths of double-heavy hadrons. We apply our result for the specific case of the coupling of the lowest lying heavy hybrids and $D_{(s)}^{(*)}\bar{D}_{(s)}^{(*)}(B_{(s)}^{(*)}\bar{B}_{(s)}^{(*)})$ obtaining a set of selection rules for the decays. We build a model for the coupling potential and compute the corresponding decay widths and the contributions to the mass of the heavy hybrids. We compare our results with the experimental exotic quarkonium spectrum and discuss the most likely experimental candidates for quarkonium hybrids.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling critical behavior in three-dimensional lattice Abelian gauge models with charged $N$-component scalar fields and $SO(N)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional lattice Abelian Higgs gauge model for a charged $N$-component scalar field ${\phi}$, which is invariant under $SO(N)$ global transformations for generic values of the parameters. We focus on the strong-coupling regime, in which the kinetic Hamiltonian term for the gauge field is a small perturbation, which is irrelevant for the critical behavior. The Hamiltonian depends on a parameter $v$ which determines the global symmetry of the model and the symmetry of the low-temperature phases. We present renormalization-group predictions, based on a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective description that relies on the identification of the appropriate order parameter and on the symmetry-breaking patterns that occur at the strong-coupling phase transitions. For $v=0$, the global symmetry group of the model is $SU(N)$; the corresponding model may undergo continuous transitions only for $N=2$. For $v\not=0$, i.e., in the $SO(N)$ symmetric case, continuous transitions (in the Heisenberg universality class) are possible also for $N=3$ and 4. We perform Monte Carlo simulations for $N=2,3,4,6$, to verify the renormalization-group predictions. Finite-size scaling analyses of the numerical data are in full agreement.</description>

      <title>Wilson Loops and Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear confinement with Casimir scaling of the string tension in confining gauge theories is a consequence of a certain property of the Polyakov loop related to random matrices. This mechanism does not depend on the details of the theories (neither the gauge group nor dimensions) and explains approximate Casimir scaling below string-breaking length. In this paper, we study 3d SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory numerically and find the same random-matrix behavior for rectangular Wilson loops. We conjecture that this is a universal feature of strongly coupled confining gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic $\Omega_{b}\rightarrow \Omega_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ transition in full QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decay of $\Omega_b\to\Omega_c~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in three lepton channels. To this end, we use QCD sum rule method in three point framework to calculate the form factors defining the matrix elements of these transitions. Having calculated the form factors as building blocks, we calculate the decay widths and branching fractions of the exclusive decays in all lepton channels and compare the results with other theoretical predictions. The obtained results for branching ratios and ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels may help experimental groups in their search for these weak decays. Comparison of the obtained results with possible future experimental data can be useful to check the order of consistency between the standard model theory predictions and data on the heavy baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Onset of scaling violation in pion and kaon elastic electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties, parameter-free predictions are delivered for pion and kaon elastic electromagnetic form factors, $F_{P=\pi,K}$, thereby unifying them with kindred results for nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors. Regarding positive-charge states, the analysis stresses that the presence of scaling violations in QCD entails that $Q^2 F_P(Q^2)$ should exhibit a single maximum on $Q^2&gt;0$. Locating such a maximum is both necessary and sufficient to establish the existence of scaling violations. The study predicts that, for charged $\pi$, $K$ mesons, the $Q^2 F_P(Q^2)$ maximum lies in the neighbourhood $Q^2 \simeq 5\,$GeV$^2$. Foreseeable experiments will test these predictions and, providing their $Q^2$ reach meets expectations, potentially also provide details on the momentum dependence of meson form factor scaling violation.</description>
