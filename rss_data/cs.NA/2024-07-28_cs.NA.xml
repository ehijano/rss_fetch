      <title>Non-intrusive model reduction of advection-dominated hyperbolic problems using neural network shift augmented manifold transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advection-dominated problems are commonly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and a wide range of industrial processes. For these problems, linear approximation methods (proper orthogonal decomposition and reduced basis method) are not suitable, as the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay is slow, leading to inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models. There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural-network shift augmented transformation technique, that employs automatic-shit detection and detects the optimal non-linear transformation of the full-order model solution manifold $\mathcal{M}$. We exploit a deep-learning framework to derive parameter-dependent bijective mapping between the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. It consists of two neural networks, 1) ShiftNet, to employ automatic-shift detection by learning the shift-operator, which finds the optimal shifts for numerous snapshots of the full-order solution manifold, to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, and 2) InterpNet, which learns the reference configuration and can reconstruct the field values of the same, for each shifted grid distribution. We construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear subspaces and employ automatic-shift detection for predictions. We test our methodology on advection-dominated problems, such as 1D travelling waves, 2D isentropic convective vortex and 2D two-phase flow test cases. This work leads to the development of the complete NNsPOD-ROM algorithm for model reduction of advection-dominated problems, comprising both offline-online stages.</description>

      <title>A stabilized three fields formulation for Discrete Fracture Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybridized domain decomposition formulation of the discrete fracture network model, allowing for independent discretization of the individual fractures. A natural norm stabilization, obtained by penalizing the residual measured in the norm for the space where it naturally lives, is added to the local problem in the individual fracture so that no compatibility condition of inf-sup type is required between the Lagrange multiplier and the primal unknown, which can then be discretized independently of each other. Optimal stability and error estimates are proven, which are confirmed by numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Improved randomized neural network methods with boundary processing for solving elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two improved randomized neural network methods, namely RNN-Scaling and RNN-Boundary-Processing (RNN-BP) methods, for solving elliptic equations such as the Poisson equation and the biharmonic equation. The RNN-Scaling method modifies the optimization objective by increasing the weight of boundary equations, resulting in a more accurate approximation. We propose the boundary processing techniques on the rectangular domain that enforce the RNN method to satisfy the non-homogeneous Dirichlet and clamped boundary conditions exactly. We further prove that the RNN-BP method is exact for some solutions with specific forms and validate it numerically. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the RNN-BP method is the most accurate among the three methods, the error is reduced by 6 orders of magnitude for some tests.</description>

      <title>Efficiently and accurately simulating multi-dimensional M-coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with fourth-order time integrators and Fourier spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations model various physical phenomena, such as wave propagation in nonlinear optics, multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and shallow water waves. Despite their extensive applications, analytical solutions of coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations are widely either unknown or challenging to compute, prompting the need for stable and efficient numerical methods to understand the nonlinear phenomenon and complex dynamics of systems governed by coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. This paper explores the use of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta based exponential time-differencing and integrating factor methods combined with the Fourier spectral method to simulate multi-dimensional M-coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.
  The theoretical derivation and stability of the methods, as well as the runtime complexity of the algorithms used for their implementation, are examined. Numerical experiments are performed on systems of two and four multi-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. It is demonstrated by the results that both methods effectively conserve mass and energy while maintaining fourth-order temporal and spectral spatial convergence. Overall, it is shown by the numerical results that the exponential time-differencing method outperforms the integrating factor method in this application, and both may be considered further in modeling more nonlinear dynamics in future work.</description>

      <title>A variational front-tracking method for multiphase flow with triple junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze a variational front-tracking method for a sharp-interface model of multiphase flow. The fluid interfaces between different phases are represented by curve networks in two space dimensions (2d) or surface clusters in three space dimensions (3d) with triple junctions where three interfaces meet, and boundary points/lines where an interface meets a fixed planar boundary. The model is described by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the bulk domains, with classical interface conditions on the fluid interfaces, and appropriate boundary conditions at the triple junctions and boundary points/lines. We propose a weak formulation for the model, which combines a parametric formulation for the evolving interfaces and an Eulerian formulation for the bulk equations. We employ an unfitted discretization of the coupled formulation to obtain a fully discrete finite element method, where the existence and uniqueness of solutions can be shown under weak assumptions. The constructed method admits an unconditional stability result in terms of the discrete energy. Furthermore, we adapt the introduced method so that an exact volume preservation for each phase can be achieved for the discrete solutions. Numerical examples for three-phase flow and four-phase flow are presented to show the robustness and accuracy of the introduced methods.</description>

      <title>On the precise quantification of the impact of a single discretionary lane change on surrounding traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane-changing is a critical maneuver of vehicle driving, and a comprehensive understanding of its impact on traffic is essential for effective traffic management and optimization. Unfortunately, existing studies fail to adequately distinguish the impact of lane changes from those resulting from natural traffic dynamics. Additionally, there is a lack of precise methods for measuring the spatial extent and duration of the impact of a single discretionary lane change, as well as a definitive metric to quantify the overall spatiotemporal impact. To address these gaps, this study introduces a quantitative indicator called the Corrected Travel Distance Bias (CTDB), which accounts for variable speeds due to inherent traffic dynamics, providing a more accurate assessment of lane-changing impacts. A comprehensive methodology is developed to compare vehicle trajectory data before and after lane-changing events, measuring both the magnitude and spatiotemporal extent of the lane-changing impact. The results, based on the Zen traffic data from Japan, indicate that the impact of a lane change in the target lane lasts an average of 23.8 seconds, affecting approximately 5.6 vehicles, with a CTDB value of -10.8 meters. In contrast, in the original lane, the impact lasts 25 seconds, affects 5.3 vehicles, and yields a CTDB value of 4.7 meters.</description>

      <title>Decoupling multistep schemes for elliptic-parabolic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the construction and convergence of decoupling multistep schemes of higher order using the backward differentiation formulae for an elliptic-parabolic problem, which includes multiple-network poroelasticity as a special case. These schemes were first introduced in [Altmann, Maier, Unger, BIT Numer. Math., 64:20, 2024], where a convergence proof for the second-order case is presented. Here, we present a slightly modified version of these schemes using a different construction of related time delay systems. We present a novel convergence proof relying on concepts from G-stability applicable for any order and providing a sharper characterization of the required weak coupling condition. The key tool for the convergence analysis is the construction of a weighted norm enabling a telescoping argument for the sum of the errors.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Super-Localized Orthogonal Decomposition Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the construction of a sparse-compressed operator that approximates the solution operator of elliptic PDEs with rough coefficients. To derive the compressed operator, we construct a hierarchical basis of an approximate solution space, with superlocalized basis functions that are quasi-orthogonal across hierarchy levels with respect to the inner product induced by the energy norm. The superlocalization is achieved through a novel variant of the Super-Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method that is built upon corrections of basis functions arising from the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method. The hierarchical basis not only induces a sparse compression of the solution space but also enables an orthogonal multiresolution decomposition of the approximate solution operator, decoupling scales and solution contributions of each level of the hierarchy. With this decomposition, the solution of the PDE reduces to the solution of a set of independent linear systems per level with mesh-independent condition numbers that can be computed simultaneously. We present an accuracy study of the compressed solution operator as well as numerical results illustrating our theoretical findings and beyond, revealing that desired optimal error rates with well-behaved superlocalized basis functions can still be attained even in the challenging case of coefficients with high-contrast channels.</description>

      <title>On Godunov-type finite volume methods for seismic wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational complexity of simulating seismic waves demands continual exploration of more efficient numerical methods. While Finite Volume methods are widely acclaimed for tackling general nonlinear hyperbolic (wave) problems, their application in realistic seismic wave simulation remains uncommon, with rare investigations in the literature. Furthermore, seismic wavefields are influenced by sharp subsurface interfaces frequently encountered in realistic models, which could, in principle, be adequately solved with Finite Volume methods. In this study, we delved into two Finite Volume (FV) methods to assess their efficacy and competitiveness in seismic wave simulations, compared to traditional Finite Difference schemes. We investigated Gudunov-type FV methods: an upwind method called wave propagation algorithm (WPA), and a Central-Upwind type method (CUp). Our numerical analysis uncovered that these finite volume methods could provide less dispersion (albeit increased dissipation) compared to finite differences for seismic problems characterized by velocity profiles with abrupt transitions in the velocity. However, when applied to more realistic seismic models, finite volume methods yielded unfavorable outcomes compared to finite difference methods, the latter offering lower computational costs and higher accuracy. This highlights that despite the potential advantages of finite volume methods, such as their conservative nature and aptitude for accurately capturing shock waves in specific contexts, our results indicate that they are only advantageous for seismic simulations when unrealistic abrupt transitions are present in the velocity models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scenario and Stochastic Thermo-Electro-Mechanical Modeling of Failure in Power Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission lines, crucial to the power grid, are subjected to diverse environmental conditions such as wind, temperature, humidity, and pollution. While these conditions represent a consistent impact on the transmission lines, certain unpredictable conditions such as unexpected high wind, wildfire, and icing pose catastrophic risks to the reliability and integrity of the transmission lines. These factors in the presence of initial damage and electrical loads greatly affect the material properties. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive thermo-electro-mechanical model to investigate the long-term effect of unexpected high wind, wildfire, and ice on transmission lines. This study offers an in-depth perspective on temperature and damage evolution within the power lines by incorporating a phase field model for damage and fatigue, alongside thermal and electrical models. We define a state function to assess the failure, considering damage and temperature. We study three scenarios deterministically to establish a basic understanding and analyze the stochastic behavior using the Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM). We utilize PCM for forward uncertainty quantification, conducting sensitivity analysis, and evaluating the probability of failure. This approach offers an in-depth examination of the potential risks associated with transmission lines under unfavorable circumstances.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Parameter Selection in Nudging Based Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation combines (imperfect) knowledge of a flow's physical laws with (noisy, time-lagged, and otherwise imperfect) observations to produce a more accurate prediction of flow statistics. Assimilation by nudging (from 1964), while non-optimal, is easy to implement and its analysis is clear and well-established. Nudging's uniform in time accuracy has even been established under conditions on the nudging parameter $\chi$ and the density of observational locations, $H$, Larios, Rebholz, and Zerfas \cite{larios2019global}. One remaining issue is that nudging requires the user to select a key parameter. The conditions required for this parameter, derived through $\acute{a}$ priori (worst case) analysis are severe (Section \ref{aprior-analysis} herein) and far beyond those found to be effective in computational experience. One resolution, developed herein, is self-adaptive parameter selection. This report develops, analyzes, tests, and compares two methods of self-adaptation of nudging parameters. One combines analysis and response to local flow behavior. The other is based only on response to flow behavior. The comparison finds both are easily implemented and yield effective values of the nudging parameter much smaller than those of $\acute{a}$ priori analysis.</description>

      <title>Local Binary Pattern(LBP) Optimization for Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of image data has led to the development of advanced image processing and computer vision techniques, which are crucial in various applications such as image classification, image segmentation, and pattern recognition. Texture is an important feature that has been widely used in many image processing tasks. Therefore, analyzing and understanding texture plays a pivotal role in image analysis and understanding.Local binary pattern (LBP) is a powerful operator that describes the local texture features of images. This paper provides a novel mathematical representation of the LBP by separating the operator into three matrices, two of which are always fixed and do not depend on the input data. These fixed matrices are analyzed in depth, and a new algorithm is proposed to optimize them for improved classification performance. The optimization process is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm. As a result, the authors present optimal LBPs that effectively describe the texture of human face images. Several experiment results presented in this paper convincingly verify the efficiency and superiority of the optimized LBPs for face detection and facial expression recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov Analysis of Accelerated PDHG Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Lasso is a remarkably versatile and extensively utilized model across a broad spectrum of domains, including statistics, machine learning, and image science. Among the optimization techniques employed to address the challenges posed by this model, saddle-point methods stand out for their effectiveness. In particular, the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm has emerged as a highly popular choice, celebrated for its robustness and efficiency in finding optimal solutions. Recently, the underlying mechanism of the PDHG algorithm has been elucidated through the high-resolution ordinary differential equation (ODE) and the implicit-Euler scheme as detailed in [Li and Shi, 2024a]. This insight has spurred the development of several accelerated variants of the PDHG algorithm, originally proposed by [Chambolle and Pock, 2011]. By employing discrete Lyapunov analysis, we establish that the PDHG algorithm with iteration-varying step sizes, converges at a rate near $O(1/k^2)$. Furthermore, for the specific setting where $\tau_{k+1}\sigma_k = s^2$ and $\theta_k = \tau_{k+1}/\tau_k \in (0, 1)$ as proposed in [Chambolle and Pock, 2011], an even faster convergence rate of $O(1/k^2)$ can be achieved. To substantiate these findings, we design a novel discrete Lyapunov function. This function is distinguished by its succinctness and straightforwardness, providing a clear and elegant proof of the enhanced convergence properties of the PDHG algorithm under the specified conditions. Finally, we utilize the discrete Lyapunov function to establish the optimal linear convergence rate when both the objective functions are strongly convex.</description>

      <title>On reduced inertial PDE models for Cucker-Smale flocking dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In particle systems, flocking refers to the phenomenon where particles' individual velocities eventually align. The Cucker-Smale model is a well-known mathematical framework that describes this behavior. Many continuous descriptions of the Cucker-Smale model use PDEs with both particle position and velocity as independent variables, thus providing a full description of the particles mean-field limit (MFL) dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel reduced inertial PDE model consisting of two equations that depend solely on particle position. In contrast to other reduced models, ours is not derived from the MFL, but directly includes the model reduction at the level of the empirical densities, thus allowing for a straightforward connection to the underlying particle dynamics. We present a thorough analytical investigation of our reduced model, showing that: firstly, our reduced PDE satisfies a natural and interpretable continuous definition of flocking; secondly, in specific cases, we can fully quantify the discrepancy between PDE solution and particle system. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Constrained and unconstrained stable discrete minimizations for p-robust local reconstructions in vertex patches in the de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze constrained and unconstrained minimization problems on patches of tetrahedra sharing a common vertex with discontinuous piecewise polynomial data of degree p. We show that the discrete minimizers in the spaces of piecewise polynomials of degree p conforming in the H1, H(curl), or H(div) spaces are as good as the minimizers in these entire (infinite-dimensional) Sobolev spaces, up to a constant that is independent of p. These results are useful in the analysis and design of finite element methods, namely for devising stable local commuting projectors and establishing local-best/global-best equivalences in a priori analysis and in the context of a posteriori error estimation. Unconstrained minimization in H1 and constrained minimization in H(div) have been previously treated in the literature. Along with improvement of the results in the H1 and H(div) cases, our key contribution is the treatment of the H(curl) framework. This enables us to cover the whole De Rham diagram in three space dimensions in a single setting.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive Galerkin FEM for parametric PDEs with lognormal coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02839v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerically solving high-dimensional random parametric PDEs poses a challenging computational problem. It is well-known that numerical methods can greatly benefit from adaptive refinement algorithms, in particular when functional approximations in polynomials are computed as in stochastic Galerkin finite element methods. This work investigates a residual based adaptive algorithm, akin to classical adaptive FEM, used to approximate the solution of the stationary diffusion equation with lognormal coefficients, i.e. with a non-affine parameter dependence of the data. It is known that the refinement procedure is reliable but the theoretical convergence of the scheme for this class of unbounded coefficients remains a challenging open question. This paper advances the theoretical state-of-the-art by providing a quasi-error reduction result for the adaptive solution of the lognormal stationary diffusion problem. The presented analysis generalizes previous results in that guaranteed convergence for uniformly bounded coefficients follows directly as a corollary. Moreover, it highlights the fundamental challenges with unbounded coefficients that cannot be overcome with common techniques. A computational benchmark example illustrates the main theoretical statement.</description>

      <title>A numerically stable communication-avoiding s-step GMRES algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods are extensively used in scientific computing to solve large-scale linear systems. However, the performance of these iterative Krylov solvers on modern supercomputers is limited by expensive communication costs. The $s$-step strategy generates a series of $s$ Krylov vectors at a time to avoid communication. Asymptotically, the $s$-step approach can reduce communication latency by a factor of $s$. Unfortunately, due to finite-precision implementation, the step size has to be kept small for stability. In this work, we tackle the numerical instabilities encountered in the $s$-step GMRES algorithm. By choosing an appropriate polynomial basis and block orthogonalization schemes, we construct a communication avoiding $s$-step GMRES algorithm that automatically selects the optimal step size to ensure numerical stability. To further maximize communication savings, we introduce scaled Newton polynomials that can increase the step size $s$ to a few hundreds for many problems. An initial step size estimator is also developed to efficiently choose the optimal step size for stability. The guaranteed stability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using numerical experiments. In the process, we also evaluate how the choice of polynomial and preconditioning affects the stability limit of the algorithm. Finally, we show parallel scalability on more than 114,000 cores in a distributed-memory setting. Perfectly linear scaling has been observed in both strong and weak scaling studies with negligible communication costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rate of convergence of the classical Thresholding Greedy Algorithm with respect to bases is studied in this paper. We bound the error of approximation by the product of both norms -- the norm of $f$ and the $A_1$-norm of $f$. We obtain some results for greedy bases, unconditional bases, and quasi-greedy bases. In particular, we prove that our bounds for the trigonometric basis and for the Haar basis are optimal.</description>

      <title>Lowest-order Nonstandard Finite Element Methods for Time-Fractional Biharmonic Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider an initial-boundary value problem for a time-fractional biharmonic equation in a bounded polygonal domain with a Lipschitz continuous boundary in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with clamped boundary conditions. After establishing the well-posedness, we focus on some regularity results of the solution with respect to the regularity of the problem data. The spatially semidiscrete scheme covers several popular lowest-order piecewise-quadratic finite element schemes, namely, Morley, discontinuous Galerkin, and $C^0$ interior penalty methods, and includes both smooth and nonsmooth initial data. Optimal order error bounds with respect to the regularity assumptions on the data are proved for both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous problems. The numerical experiments validate the theoretical convergence rate results.</description>

      <title>Using the Transport of Intensity and the Transport of Phase Equation for Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of intensity equation (TIE) and the transport of phase equation (TPE) for solving the phase retrieval problem. Both the TIE and the TPE are derived from the paraxial Helmholtz equation and relate phase information to the intensity. The TIE is usually favored since the TPE is nonlinear. The main contribution of this paper is a discussion of preferential use of either one of the two equations or potential benefits of a hybrid use. Moreover, we discuss the solution of the TPE with the method of characteristics and with viscosity methods. Both the TIE and the viscosity method are numerically implemented with finite element methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Solutions for Complex PDEs: Introducing Complementary Convolution and Equivariant Attention in Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators improve conventional neural networks by expanding their capabilities of functional mappings between different function spaces to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). One of the most notable methods is the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which draws inspiration from Green's function method and directly approximates operator kernels in the frequency domain. However, after empirical observation followed by theoretical validation, we demonstrate that the FNO approximates kernels primarily in a relatively low-frequency domain. This suggests a limited capability in solving complex PDEs, particularly those characterized by rapid coefficient changes and oscillations in the solution space. Such cases are crucial in specific scenarios, like atmospheric convection and ocean circulation. To address this challenge, inspired by the translation equivariant of the convolution kernel, we propose a novel hierarchical Fourier neural operator along with convolution-residual layers and attention mechanisms to make them complementary in the frequency domain to solve complex PDEs. We perform experiments on forward and reverse problems of multiscale elliptic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and other physical scenarios, and find that the proposed method achieves superior performance in these PDE benchmarks, especially for equations characterized by rapid coefficient variations.</description>

      <title>An optimal transport model for dynamical shapes, collective motion and cellular aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many biological systems such as cell aggregates, tissues or bacterial colonies behave as unconventional systems of particles that are strongly constrained by volume exclusion and shape interactions. Understanding how these constraints lead to macroscopic self-organized structures is a fundamental question in e.g. developmental biology. To this end, various types of computational models have been developed: phase fields, cellular automata, vertex models, level-set, finite element simulations, etc. We introduce a new framework based on optimal transport theory to model particle systems with arbitrary dynamical shapes and deformability. Our method builds upon the pioneering work of Brenier on incompressible fluids and its recent applications to materials science. It lets us specify the shapes of individual cells and supports a wide range of interaction mechanisms, while automatically taking care of the volume exclusion constraint at an affordable numerical cost. We showcase the versatility of this approach by reproducing several classical systems in computational biology.

      <title>A Correlation-induced Finite Difference Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating stochastic gradients is pivotal in fields like service systems within operations research. The classical method for this estimation is the finite difference approximation, which entails generating samples at perturbed inputs. Nonetheless, practical challenges persist in determining the perturbation and obtaining an optimal finite difference estimator in the sense of possessing the smallest mean squared error (MSE). To tackle this problem, we propose a double sample-recycling approach in this paper. Firstly, pilot samples are recycled to estimate the optimal perturbation. Secondly, recycling these pilot samples again and generating new samples at the estimated perturbation, lead to an efficient finite difference estimator. We analyze its bias, variance and MSE. Our analyses demonstrate a reduction in asymptotic variance, and in some cases, a decrease in asymptotic bias, compared to the optimal finite difference estimator. Therefore, our proposed estimator consistently coincides with, or even outperforms the optimal finite difference estimator. In numerical experiments, we apply the estimator in several examples, and numerical results demonstrate its robustness, as well as coincidence with the theory presented, especially in the case of small sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the heat equation with physical boundary conditions via Schrodingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the explicit design of quantum circuits for quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) with physical boundary conditions. These equations and/or their discretized forms usually do not evolve via unitary dynamics, thus are not suitable for quantum simulation. Boundary conditions (either time-dependent or independent) make the problem more difficult. To tackle this challenge, the Schrodingerisation method can be employed, which converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations, via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher dimension. Despite advancements in Schrodingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of quantum circuits for solving general PDEs, especially with physical boundary conditions, remains underdeveloped. We present two methods for handling the inhomogeneous terms arising from time-dependent physical boundary conditions. One approach utilizes Duhamel's principle to express the solution in integral form and employs linear combination of unitaries (LCU) for coherent state preparation. Another method applies an augmentation to transform the inhomogeneous problem into a homogeneous one. We then apply the quantum simulation technique from [CJL23] to transform the resulting non-autonomous system to an autonomous system in one higher dimension. We provide detailed implementations of these two methods and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis in terms of queries to the time evolution input oracle.</description>
