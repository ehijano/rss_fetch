      <title>Distances between operators acting on different Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to define and compare several distances (or metrics) between operators acting on different (separable) Hilbert spaces. We consider here three main cases of how to measure the distance between two bounded operators: first by taking the distance between their unitary orbits, second by isometric embeddings (this generalises a concept of Weidmann) and third by quasi-unitary equivalence (using a concept of the first author of the present article).
  Our main result is that the unitary and isometric distances are equal provided the operators are both self-adjoint and have $0$ in their essential spectra. Moreover, the quasi-unitary distance is equivalent (up to a universal constant) with the isometric distance for any pair of bounded operators. The unitary distance gives an upper bound on the Hausdorff distance of their spectrum. If both operators have purely essential spectrum, then the unitary distance equals the Hausdorff distance of their spectra. Using a finer spectral distance respecting multiplicity of discrete eigenvalues, this spectral distance equals the unitary distance also for operators with essential and discrete spectrum. In particular, all operator distances mentioned above are equal to this spectral distance resp. controlled by it in the quasi-unitary case for self-adjoint operators with $0$ in the essential spectrum. We also show that our results are sharp by presenting various (counter-)examples. Finally, we discuss related convergence concepts complementing results from our first article arXiv:2202.03234</description>

      <title>A partial proof of the Brouwer's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges and let $k$ be a natural number such that $k\leq n.$ Brouwer conjectured that the sum of the $k$ largest Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$ is at most $m+{k+1 \choose 2}.$ In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true for simple $(m,n)$-graphs where $n\leq m\leq \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{4}(n-1)n$ and $k\in \left[ \sqrt[3]{\frac{8m^{2}}{n-1}+4mn+n^{2}}, n\right].$ Moreover, we prove that the conjecture is true for all simple $(m,n)$-graphs where $k (\leq n)$ is a natural number from the interval $\left[\sqrt{2n-2m+2\sqrt{2m^{2}+mn(n-1)}},1+\frac{8m^{2}}{n^{2}(n-1)}+\frac{4m}{n}\right].$</description>

      <title>Minimization of the first eigenvalue for the Lam\'e system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of determining a domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that minimizes the first eigenvalue of the Lam\'e system under a volume constraint. We begin by establishing the existence of such an optimal domain within the class of quasi-open sets, showing that in the physically relevant dimensions $N = 2$ and $3$, the optimal domain is indeed an open set. Additionally, we derive both first and second-order optimality conditions. Leveraging these conditions, we demonstrate that in two dimensions, the disk cannot be the optimal shape when the Poisson ratio is below a specific threshold, whereas above this value, it serves as a local minimizer. We also extend our analysis to show that the disk is nonoptimal for Poisson ratios $\nu$ satisfying $\nu \leq 0.4$.</description>
