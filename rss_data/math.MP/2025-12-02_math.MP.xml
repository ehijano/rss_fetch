      <title>Witt type Realizations of 2-D Cayley-Klein Algebras with non-zero curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article presents various Witt type vector field realizations of 2-D Cayley-Klein algebras with non-vanishing curvatures. The expressions of the vector fields involve Jacobi elliptic functions whose moduli are directly related to the parameters that appear in the corresponding matrix representation obtained from a bi-orthogonal set of vectors. First, the realizations are obtained with the values of the moduli lying in the unit interval (0, 1). The parameter of biorthogonality plays a crucial role in this context. Later, with the help of modular transformation, realizations involving arbitrary moduli have been obtained.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to spinor duals via Clifford algebras and $G_\Omega$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the construction of generalized Dirac duals have revealed, within the structure of the Clifford algebra $\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathcal{C}\ell_{1,3},$ the existence of distinct algebraic formulations of spinors duals with potential applications in quantum field theoretic models. In this work, after reviewing the matrix formulation, we employ the recent covariant formulation of the generalized spinor dual and establish its interplay with the algebra $\mathcal{C}\ell_{1,3}$. We construct dual mappings governed by groups denoted by $G_\Omega$ and introduce the notion of $\Omega$-equivalence classes as a tool to classify dual spinors from a group-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>Simple Eigenvalues and Non-vanishing Eigenvectors of the Anderson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson model on the finite grid $G = \mathbb Z/L_1\mathbb Z\times\cdots\times\mathbb Z/L_d\mathbb Z$, defined by the random Hamiltonian $H_t=\Delta+tV$, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian and $V=\mathrm{diag}(\{\omega_{x}\}_{x\in G})$ is a random onsite potential with $\omega_x\sim\mu$ i.i.d. We ask the natural question of when $H_t$ has simple eigenvalues and non-vanishing eigenvectors. We prove that, when $\mu$ is a continuous probability distribution, $H_t$ has this property for all but finitely many $t$ values with probability $1$. However, when $\mu$ is a Bernoulli distribution, the conditions fail with positive probability, for which we give a lower bound. We also calculate the exact probability of these conditions being met in the Bernoulli case when $d = 1$ and $L = L_1$ is prime.</description>

      <title>On the eigenvalues of a central configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations of the Newtonian $n$-body problem have a matrix form, where an $n\times n$ matrix depending on the masses and on the mutual distances appears as a factor. The $n$ eigenvalues of this matrix are real and nonnegative. In a motion of relative equilibrium, the configuration, called {\it central}, has constant mutual distances. The matrix is constant. We prove that in a relative equilibrium of 5 bodies the two nontrivial eigenvalues are strictly greater than the three trivial ones. This result improves published inequalities about the central configurations, which belong to two independent lines of research. One starts with Williams in 1938 and concerns constraints on the shape of the configuration. The other concerns the Hessian of the potential and its index, and applies to the linear stability of the self-similar motions and to the possible bifurcations. We also considerably clarify the very useful identities with which Williams discusses his inequalities.</description>

      <title>Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</description>

      <title>Generalized Boltzmann-Gibbs Distribution and the Electronic Partition Function Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the entropy maximization problem leading to the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution through the nonadditive entropy $S_{q,s}(p)=k_{s}\sum^{W}_{i\geq1}p_{i}\ln_{q}1/p_{i}$, $q\in(0,1)$, which is a rescaled version of $S_{q}$ \cite{Tsallis1988} by a factor $k_{s}=k^{q}(e_{\max}/(W^{\sigma}-1))^{1-q}$, $\sigma&gt;0$, varying according to the underlying energy spectrum and satisfying $k_{s}\rightarrow k$ (Boltzmann constant) as $q\rightarrow 1$. The maximization problem based on $S_{q,s}$ is used to derive analytical generalizations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the case of an energy spectrum that uniformly approaches a continuous, unbounded limit with a common degeneracy, the harmonic oscillator, and the one-dimensional box. Furthermore, I demonstrate that this generalized problem yields a two-tier model with finite structural parameters $\beta$ for the hydrogen atom in free space and, therefore, can be used to circumvent the Electronic Partition Function Paradox and obtain a family of well-defined thermodynamic behaviors indexed by $q\in(0,1)$. In particular, for $q=0.5$, the specific heat of the free hydrogen atom becomes the Boltzmann constant. Finally, it is shown that all the limiting processes involved in these four cases lead naturally to the same definition of the scale factor $k_{s}$ that characterizes $S_{q,s}$ (``s'' stands, in this context, for ``spectrum'') in order to grant finite, smooth, macroscopically observable temperature values that are related to the entropic functional by $\partial S_{q,s}/\partial U=1/\vert T\vert^{q}_{\pm}$, which recovers $\partial S_{BG}/\partial U=1/T$ \cite{Clausius1865} as $q\rightarrow1$.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum dynamics of Fermi--Hubbard systems using the Gaussian phase-space representation with diffusion gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Gaussian Phase-Space Representation to solve the real-time dynamic of interacting fermions in 1D, 2D, and 3D systems. The method is exact up to a spiking point, which represents a limit on the practical simulation time. The spiking can be delayed, and the practical simulation time extended, by adjusting the gauges of the representation, resulting in different equivalent stochastic differential equations. Here, we work on the so-called diffusion gauge and propose an algorithm to find efficiently new implementations of the noise terms. Compared with our initial results [F. Rousse \textit{et al.} 2024, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \textbf{57}, 015303], the new method achieves a significantly longer practical simulation time and can be applied to significantly larger systems.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Physics-Driven Deep Learning Framework for a Two-Phase Stefan Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal Energy Storage (TES) using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) represents a critical technology for sustainable energy management and grid stability. This study presents a novel Physics-Driven Deep Learning (PDDL) framework for modeling the complex solid-liquid phase transition in a two-dimensional PCM-based TES system integrated with finned heat exchangers. The system operates under transient forced convection with cooling air, presenting a challenging Moving Boundary Problem (MBP) characterized by intricate phase interface dynamics and strong geometrical dependencies. Conventional numerical methods for such Stefan problems face significant computational burdens due to repeated meshing requirements at the evolving interface. To overcome these limitations, we develop a multi-network PDDL approach that simultaneously predicts the solid phase temperature field, fin temperature distribution, and the moving phase boundary position. The architecture employs three specialized deep neural networks operating in parallel, constrained by the governing physical laws of energy conservation and interface conditions. Comprehensive validation against established analytical benchmarks demonstrates the framework's exceptional accuracy in predicting interface evolution and temperature distributions across various aspect ratios. The model successfully captures the parametric influence of geometrical parameter on solidification rates and thermal performance without requiring mesh regeneration. Our approach provides an efficient computational paradigm for optimizing PCM based TES systems and offers extensibility to three-dimensional configurations and multi-material composites, presenting significant potential for advanced thermal energy system design.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Invertible Stabilizer Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the classification of invertible translation-invariant stabilizer codes modulo condensation and stabilization with simple codes. We introduce generalizations of the Pauli groups of local unitaries for quantum systems of qudits on cubic lattices and analyze stabilizer Hamiltonians whose terms are chosen from these groups. We define invertible stabilizer codes to be ground states of stabilizer Hamiltonians with trivial topological charges and completely classify them in any spatial dimension in terms of relative L-theory groups. In particular, we show that the group of equivalence classes of such codes in three spatial dimensions is isomorphic to the Witt group of abelian topological orders in two spatial dimensions. Additionally, we propose the spectrum of the relative L-theory as a representative of the generalized cohomology theory corresponding to the invertible stabilizer states.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spectral form factors of circular unitary ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral form factor (SFF), one of the key quantity from random matrix theory, serves as an important tool to probe universality in disordered quantum systems and quantum chaos. In this work, we present exact closed-form expressions for the second- and third-order SFFs in the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), valid for all real values of the time parameter, and analyze their asymptotic behavior in different regimes. In particular, for the second-order SFF, we derive an exact closed-form expression in terms of polygamma functions. In the limit of infinite matrix size, and when the time parameter is restricted to integer values, the second-order SFF reproduces the standard result established in earlier studies. When the time parameter is of order one relative to the matrix size, we demonstrate that the second-order SFF grows logarithmically with the ensemble dimension. For the third-order SFFs, a closed-form result in a special case is obtained by exploiting the translational invariance of CUE.</description>

      <title>Around the semi-classical limit of boundary Liouville conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liouville conformal field theory describes a random geometry that fluctuates around a deterministic one: the unique solution of the problem of finding, within a given conformal class, a Riemannian metric with prescribed scalar and geodesic curvatures as well as conical singularities and corners. The level of randomness in Liouville theory is measured by the coupling constant $\gamma\in(0,2)$, the semi-classical limit corresponding to taking $\gamma\to0$.
  Based on the probabilistic definition of Liouville theory, we prove that this semi-classical limit exists and does give rise to this deterministic geometry. At second order this limit is described in terms of a massive Gaussian free field with Robin boundary conditions.
  This in turn allows to implement CFT-inspired techniques in a deterministic setting: in particular we define the classical stress-energy tensor, show that it can be expressed in terms of accessory parameters (written as regularized derivatives of the Liouville action), and that it gives rise to classical higher equations of motion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prime-encode the natural numbers via recursive factorisation, iterated to the exponents, generating a corpus of planar rooted trees equivalently represented as Dyck words. This forms a deterministic text endowed with internal rules. Statistical analysis of the corpus reveals that the dictionary and the entropy grow sublinearly, compression shows non-monotonic trend, and the rank-frequency curves assume a stable parabolic form deviating from Zipf's law. Correlation analysis using mean-squared displacement reveals a transition from normal diffusion to superdiffusion in the associated walk. These findings characterise the tree-encoded sequence as a statistically structured text with long-range correlations grounded in its generative arithmetic law, providing an empirical basis for subsequent theoretical and learnability</description>

      <title>Robustness and resilience of dynamical networks in biology and epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural systems are remarkably robust and resilient, maintaining essential functions despite variability, uncertainty, and hostile conditions. Understanding these nonlinear, dynamic behaviours is challenging because such systems involve many interacting parameters, yet it is crucial for explaining processes from cellular regulation to disease onset and epidemic spreading. Robustness and resilience describe a system's ability to preserve and recover desired behaviours in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations. This survey reviews how different disciplines define these concepts, examines methods for assessing whether key properties of uncertain, networked dynamical systems are structural (parameter-free) or robust (preserved for parameter variations within an uncertainty bounding set), and discusses integrated structural and probabilistic techniques for biological and epidemiological models. The text introduces formal definitions of resilience for families of systems obtained by adding stochastic perturbations to a nominal deterministic model, enabling a probabilistic characterisation of the ability to remain within or return to a prescribed attractor. These definitions generalise probabilistic robustness and shed new light on classical biological examples. In addition, the survey summarises resilience indicators and data-driven tools for detecting resilience loss and regime shifts, drawing on bifurcation analysis to anticipate qualitative changes in system behaviour. Together, these methodologies support the study and control of complex natural systems, guiding the design of biomolecular feedback architectures, the identification of therapeutic targets, the forecasting and management of epidemics, and the detection of tipping points in ecological and biological networks.</description>

      <title>Augmentation and Bulk Edge Correspondence for one dimensional aperiodic tight binding operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a particular class of 1D aperiodic models with the aim to understand how their internal degrees of freedom contribute to their topological invariants and the possible relations (correspondences) among them. In order to handle models with finite local complexity we introduce the principle of augmentation. This allows us to relate the values of the Integrated Density of States at gap energies for the bulk system to spectral flows. We consider two different augmentations. The first is based on the mapping torus construction. It leads to an alternative proof of the result that the gap labelling group of Bellissard coincides with that of Johnson-Moser. It furthermore allows for an interpretation of the spectral flow via boundary forces. The second augmentation applies to models obtained by the cut and project method where we find for 2-cut models two different spectral flows, one attached to the edge modes and related to the phason motion whereas the other is an augmented bulk invariant. Our approach is based on the well-established $C^*$-algebraic approach to solid state physics and the description of topological invariants by $K$-theory and cyclic cocycles. We also present numerical simulations to illustrate our theorems.</description>

      <title>Continuity inequalities for sandwiched R\'enyi and Tsallis conditional entropies with application to the channel entropy continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the sandwiched R\'enyi entropy the conditional entropy can be defined two ways: $\widetilde{H}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho, \widetilde{H}^\uparrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho$. In the limiting case, $\alpha=1$, both definitions consolidate into conditional entropy $H(A|B)=S(AB)-S(B)$. The continuity inequality for conditional entropy $H(A|B)$, called the Alicki-Fannes-Winter (AWF) inequality, shows that if the states are close in trace-distance, then the conditional entropies are also close. Having the AWF inequality for conditional entropy, we show that the channel entropy defined through the relative entropy is continuous with respect to the diamond-distance between channels. Inspired by this, similar continuity inequalities for the R\'enyi conditional entropy $\widetilde{H}^\uparrow_\alpha$ were obtained in the work [A. Marwah and F. Dupuis, J. Math. Phys. 63, 052201 (2022)]. We provide continuity bounds for the sandwiched R\'enyi and Tsallis conditional entropies $\widetilde{H}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho, \widetilde{T}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho$ for states with the same marginal on the conditioning system. Similar to the previous bounds, our bound depends only on the dimension of the conditioning system. We apply this result to prove continuity of the channel entropy for R\'enyi and Tsallis channel entropies defined through the sandwiched R\'enyi and Tsallis relative entropies.</description>

      <title>A novel chain of Lie algebras and its coalgebra symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a novel $n(n+1)/2$-dimensional non-semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_n$, a generalisation of both $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{K})$ and the two-photon Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}_6$. We investigate its properties, including its structure, representations, and its Casimir elements. In particular, we prove that there exists only one non-trivial Casimir polynomial of degree $n$ given by the determinant of an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix. We then associate this Lie algebra to a hierarchy of Hamiltonian systems with integrability properties depending on $n$, and describe their first integrals as sums of squares of linear combinations of the components of the angular momentum. In particular, we obtain that these systems are integrable for $n=2$, quasi-integrable for $n=3$, and of Poincar\'e-Lyapunov-Nekhoroshev type for $n\geq4$.</description>

      <title>Variational Principle for Stochastic Mechanics Based on Information Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.00392v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic mechanics is regarded as a physical theory to explain quantum mechanics with classical terms such that some of the quantum mechanics paradoxes can be avoided. Here we propose a new variational principle to uncover more insights on stochastic mechanics. According to this principle, information measures, such as relative entropy and Fisher information, are imposed as constraints on top of the least action principle. This principle not only recovers Nelson's theory and consequently, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, but also clears an unresolved issue in stochastic mechanics on why multiple Lagrangians can be used in the variational method and yield the same theory. The concept of forward and backward paths provides an intuitive physical picture for stochastic mechanics. Each path configuration is considered as a degree of freedom and has its own law of dynamics. Thus, the variation principle proposed here can be a new tool to derive more advanced stochastic theory by including additional degrees of freedom in the theory. The structure of Lagrangian developed here shows that some terms in the Lagrangian are originated from information constraints. This suggests a Lagrangian may need to include both physical and informational terms in order to have a complete description of the dynamics of a physical system.</description>

      <title>Alternative Framework to Quantize Fermionic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02362v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variational framework is developed here to quantize fermionic fields based on the extended stationary action principle. From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is augmented to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that leads to the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian can generate the Poincar\'{e} algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. Concrete calculation of the probability of particle creation for the fermionic field under the influence of constant external field confirms that the results agree with those using standard canonical quantization. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Conformal blocks of Wess-Zumino-Witten model from its free-field representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A powerful approach to the celebrated Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model is provided by its free-field realization. However, explicit calculations of conformal blocks are not described in the literature in full detail. We begin this study with the simplest cases of the $\hat{sl}(2)_k$ and $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ WZW models, with special emphasis on their global $sl(2)$ and $sl(3)$ symmetries of the resulting correlators, which are not explicit in this formalism. Also non-trivial is the verification of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations in the $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ case, where the answers take the form of double integrals over screening charge positions and do not look like ordinary hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>An Operational Quantum Information Framework for Experimental Studies on Color Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schr\"odinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.</description>

      <title>Finite Gauss-Sum Modular Kernels: Scalar Gap and a Pure AdS$_3$ Gravity No-Go Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain closed-form expressions for the $ST^nS$ modular kernels of non-rational Virasoro CFTs and use them to construct fully analytic modular-bootstrap functionals. At rational width $\tau$, the Mordell integrals in these kernels reduce to finite quadratic Gauss sums of $\operatorname{sech}/\sec$ profiles with explicit Weil phases, furnishing a canonical finite-dimensional real basis for spectral kernels. From this basis we build finite-support "window" functionals with $\Phi(0)=1$ and $\Phi(p)&gt;0$ on a prescribed low-momentum interval. Applied to the scalar channel of the $ST^1S$ kernel, these functionals yield a rigorous analytic bound on the spinless gap. As a second application we prove an analytic no-go theorem for pure AdS$_3$ gravity: no compact, unitary, Virasoro-only CFT$_2$ can have a primary gap above $\Delta_{\rm BTZ}=(c-1)/12$, because a strictly positive "Mordell surplus" in the odd-spin $ST$ kernel forces an odd-spin primary below $\Delta_{\rm BTZ}$.</description>

      <title>Linearized instability of Couette flow in stress-power law fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the linearized stability of plane Couette flow for stress-power law fluids, which exhibit non-monotonic stress-strain rate behavior. The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow of a colloidal solution between two parallel disks rotating with the same angular velocity about two non-coincident axes was studied. The problem has been approached from two perspectives, the first wherein the stress is expressed in terms of a power-law of kinematical quantities, and the second wherein we consider a non-standard model where the symmetric part of the velocity gradient is given by a power-law of the stress. For a range of power-law exponents, the class of models are non-invertible. By varying the material and geometric parameters, changes in the flow behaviour at different Reynolds numbers were analysed. We find that pronounced boundary layers develop even at low Reynolds numbers based on the power-law exponents. The new class of stress power-law fluids and fluids that exhibit limiting stress also show the ability to develop boundary layers.</description>

Abstract: The theory of admissible modules over symmetrizable anisotropic Kac-Moody superalgebras, introduced by Kac and Wakimoto in late 80's, is a well-developed subject with many applications, including representation theory of vertex algebras. Recently this theory was developed in a more general setup by Gorelik and Serganova. In the present paper we develop in this more general setup the theory of admissible modules over arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody superalgebras.</description>

Abstract: We derive a form of master loop equations for the lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with structure group $SO(N)$, $U(N)$ or $SU(N)$. Compared to the pure Yang-Mills setting, several new operations arise. In fact, to obtain a closed recursion we must broaden the class of observables to include open Wilson lines. Our approach is based on the conditional Langevin dynamic and yields a concise proof via It\^o's formula.</description>

      <title>Turing pattern induced by cross-diffusion in cancer immunotherapy model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a mathematical model describing the interactions between effector cells (E), cancer cells (T), and the IL-2 compound (IL). The model considered here is a generalization, taking into account some cross-diffusion effects, of a spatial cancer immunotherapy model proposed by S. Suddin et al in 2021. These modifications allow us to describe two biologically relevant scenarios: a patient treated with Adoptive Cell Immunotherapy (ACI) and a patient not receiving any treatment/therapy. Cross-diffusion effects are particularly relevant in the interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, in fact they play a key role in immune response dynamics and cannot be neglected. We analyze the equilibrium points of the homogeneous system, along with their stability and bifurcation mechanisms. Furthermore, adopting the Turing approach for reaction-diffusion systems, we investigate the diffusion-driven instability and the emergence of spatial regular structures (stationary in time), i.e. the patterns. Finally, numerical simulations based on the Finite Difference Method (FDM) are presented for the two previously mentioned scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The positive part $U_q^+$ of the quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ has a reflection equation presentation of Freidel-Maillet type, due to Baseilhac 2021. This presentation involves a K-matrix of dimension $2 \times 2$. Under an embedding of $U_q^+$ into a $q$-shuffle algebra due to Rosso 1995, this K-matrix can be written in closed form using a PBW basis for $U_q^+$ due to Terwilliger 2019. This PBW basis, together with two PBW bases due to Damiani 1993 and Beck 1994, can be obtain from a uniform approach by Ruan 2025. Following a natural fusion technique, we will construct fused K-matrices of arbitary meaningful dimension in closed form using the uniform approach. We will also show that any pair of these fused K-matrices satisfy Freidel-Maillet type equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic evaluation of the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method for electronic structure based on the W4-11 thermochemistry dataset, comprising 124 total atomization, 83 bond dissociation, 20 isomerization, 505 heavy-atom transfer, and 13 nucleophilic substitution processes, covering diverse bonding situations and reaction mechanisms. This is the largest study assessing the accuracy and precision of a quantum-hybrid algorithm on a digital quantum device across a variety of molecular systems and chemical reactions, using 16.85 hours on the superconducting quantum processor ibm_rensselaer and 724.22 node hours on the supercomputer AiMOS. To ensure a fair comparison, our study employs commensurate resource allocation for both classical and quantum simulations. Although SQD exhibits large statistical deviations from ground-state reference energies, energy extrapolations yield CCSD-level accuracy. While bond-breaking reactions show a systematic improvement as computational resources increase, nucleophilic substitution or heavy atom transfer reactions do not. The limitations quantified in this manuscript indicate opportunities for improvement in SQD-based algorithms. This work provides a benchmark and community resource for exploring new quantum algorithms and devices, supported by an online benchmark challenge and an open-source Python library for direct comparison.</description>

      <title>Inversions of stochastic processes from ergodic measures of Nonlinear SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a novel class of inverse problems for stochastic dynamics: Given the ergodic invariant measure of a stochastic process governed by a nonlinear stochastic ordinary or partial differential equation (SODE or SPDE), we investigate the unique identifiability of the underlying process--specifically, the recovery of its drift and diffusion terms. This stands in contrast to the classical problem of statistical inference from trajectory data. We establish unique identifiability results under several key scenarios, including cases with both multiplicative and additive noise, for both finite- and infinite-dimensional systems. Our analysis leverages the intrinsic structure of the governing equations and their quantitative relationship with the ergodic measure, thereby transforming the identifiability problem into a uniqueness issue for the solutions to the associated stationary Fokker-Planck equations. This approach reveals fundamental differences between drift and diffusion inversion problems and provides counterexamples where unique recovery fails. This work lays the theoretical foundation for a new research direction with significant potential for practical application.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Single-Photon Detector: Achieving Superconducting-Level Performance with Conventional Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance single-photon detectors (SPDs) are indispensable components for quantum optical tasks. However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and challenging operational conditions (e.g., cryogenics), which hinder scalable commercial deployment. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This level of performance is comparable to or surpasses recently designed superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the scheme's device requirements are moderate, relying on readily available current technology, which ensures near-term experimental feasibility. The ESPD framework thus provides a clear, scalable path toward the large-scale deployment of high-performance SPDs and the commercialization of quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Stability Criteria for Multi-Fluid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof establishing the mathematical equivalence between two independent criteria for the marginal stability of multi-fluid relativistic stars: the dynamical criterion based on the vanishing of the fundamental radial pulsation mode's eigenfrequency, and the static criterion derived from the geometric alignment of mass and particle number gradients in the parameter space. Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble. This work supplies a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting multi-messenger astronomical observations and constraining the properties of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Stability of Neutron-Dark Matter Mixed Stars and Hybrid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concerning the stability of two-fluid star models, we prove the rigorous equivalence of two independent determining methods for mixed stars, after a brief review of the hybrid star case. Our derivations apply to general multi-fluid cases, and here we take dark matter admixed neutron star models for example, demonstrating a stability boundary distinct from the single-fluid case. Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars. This group includes twin stars with identical masses and radii but different interior structures. These results can help interpret compact star observations and constrain dark matter properties through astrophysics.</description>

      <title>From Toggle to Tuning: Controlling Turing Patterns in Gene Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling spatial patterns in synthetic biological systems remains challenging due to poor parameter robustness and limited experimental tunability. We introduce two complementary mechanisms-the pattern switch and the pattern dial-to systematically control Turing pattern formation in gene circuits. The switch toggles pattern onset via a single parameter, while the dial enables transitions between distinct pattern types using weakly nonlinear amplitude equations. Analyzing network size reveals a key trade-off: small networks are easier to control but less robust, while larger networks gain robustness at the cost of tunability-suggesting a sweet spot for both evolvability and designability. Our results offer practical design rules for engineering programmable patterns in living systems.</description>

      <title>Folded optimal transport and its application to separable quantum optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce folded optimal transport, as a way of extending a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole set, broadening the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case where the convex is a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovitch cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-Fran\c{c}a [3], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. Folded optimal transport provides a unified setting for both classical and separable quantum optimal transport, and we also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [12] cost writes as a folded Kantorovitch cost.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete description of multiple D$p$-brane systems: Multiple D$0$ Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we address the problem of constructing the complete supersymmetric description of systems of $N$ nearly coincident Dirichlet $p$-branes (multiple D$p$-brane or mD$p$). A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory.</description>

Abstract: The Sasano sytem of type $A^{(2)}_5$ is a four-dimensional non-linear system of ordinary differential equations, which has an affine Weyl group of symmetries of type $A^{(2)}_5$. It is also a tipe dependent Hamiltonian system, which can be considered as coupled Painlev\'e III systems. In this paper, utilizing the Morales-Ramis-Sim\'o theory for integrability of Hamiltonian systems, we prove rigorously that for all values of the parameters, for which the Sasano system of type $A^{(2)}_5$ admits a particular rational solution, it is non-integrable by rational first integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a conservative formulation of the Standard Enskog equation and the Povzner equation, both of which generalize the Boltzmann equation by incorporating the contribution of particle volume in collisions. The primary result expresses these collision integrals as the divergence with respect to the velocity variable v of a mass current. Moreover, the terms v C[f,f] and |v|^2 C[f,f], where C[f,f] denotes the Standard Enskog or Povzner collision integral, are represented as phase-space divergences (that is, divergences in both position and velocity) of corresponding momentum and energy currents. This work extends Villani's earlier result (Math. Modelling Numer. Anal. M2AN 33 (1999), 209--227) for the classical Boltzmann equation to the case of dense gases.</description>

Abstract: We extend the framework of quantum pushforward designs to the approximate setting, where averaging is achieved only up to finite precision. Using Schatten $p$-norms and Lipschitz continuity arguments, we derive bounds on the approximation parameters of pushforward designs obtained from complex projective spaces, including simplices, mixed states, and quantum channels. In the mixed-state case, we refine the bounds by exploiting the symmetric subspace structure, leading to asymptotically tighter estimates. Numerical simulations support our theoretical results, showing near-optimality in low-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention continuous on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Testing Transformer Learnability on the Arithmetic Sequence of Rooted Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Domain-Decomposed Graph Neural Network Surrogate Modeling for Ice Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study the discrete eigenvalues emerging from the threshold of the essential spectrum of one or two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with complex-valued $ L^p $-potentials in a weak coupling regime. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the potential for the existence or absence of discrete eigenvalues in this regime and also analyze their uniqueness and algebraic multiplicity. Our results can be viewed as natural non-self-adjoint extensions of the well-known classical weak coupling phenomenon for self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators with real-valued potentials going back half a century to Simon's famous paper [Simon 1976].</description>

Abstract: We discuss the propagation of kinetic energy through billiard balls fixed in place along a one-dimensional segment. The number of billiard balls is assumed to be large but finite and we assume kinetic energy propagates following the usual collision laws of physics. Assuming an underlying stochastic mean-field for the expectation and the variance of the kinetic energy, we derive a coupled system of nonlinear partial difference equations. Our results are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Map enumeration from a dynamical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution summarizes recent work of the authors that combines methods from dynamical systems theory (discrete Painlev\'e equations) and asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomial recurrences, to address long-standing questions in map enumeration. Given a genus $g$, we present a framework that provides the generating function for the number of maps that can be realized on a surface of that genus. In the case of 4-valent maps, our methodology leads to explicit expressions for map counts. For general even or mixed valence, the number of vertices of the map specifies the relevant order of the derivatives of the generating function that needs to be considered. Beyond summarizing our own results, we provide context for the program highlighted in this article through a brief review of the literature describing advances in map enumeration. In addition, we discuss open problems and challenges related to this fascinating area of research that stands at the intersection of statistical physics, random matrices, orthogonal polynomials, and discrete dynamical systems theory.</description>

      <title>Existence of orthogonal domain walls in B{\'e}nard-Rayleigh convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In B{\'e}nard-Rayleigh convection we consider the pattern defect in orthogonal domain walls connecting a set of convective rolls with another set of rolls orthogonal to the first set. This is understood as an heteroclinic orbit of a reversible system where the x-coordinate plays the role of time. This appears as a perturbation of the heteroclinic orbit proved to exist in a reduced 6-dimensional system studied by a variational method in [3], and studied analytically in [10]. We then prove for a given amplitude, and an imposed symmetry in coordinate y, the existence of a one parameter family of heteroclinic connections between orthogonal sets of rolls, with wave numbers (different in general) which are linked to an adapted ''shift'' of rolls parallel to the wall.</description>

      <title>Heteroclinic for a 6-dimensional reversible system occuring in orthogonal domain walls in convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A six-dimensional reversible normal form system occurs in B{\'e}nard-Rayleigh convection between parallel planes, when we look for domain walls intersecting orthogonally (see Buffoni et al [1]). On the truncated system, we prove analytically the existence, local uniqueness, and analyticity in parameters, of a heteroclinic connection between two equilibria, each corresponding to a system of convective rolls. We prove that the 3-dimensional unstable manifold of one equilibrium, intersects transversally the 3-dimensional stable manifold of the other equilibrium, both manifolds lying on a 5-dimensional invariant manifold. We also study the linearized operator along the heteroclinic, allowing to prove (in [9]) the persistence under reversible perturbation, of the heteroclinic obtained in [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The irrational torus, $\mathrm{T}_\alpha$, originally introduced as a geometric model for quasicrystals, is a foundational object in the theory of diffeology. This paper, after recalling its main algebraic properties, provides a comprehensive analysis of a new geometric invariant for this singular space: the group of flows, $\mathbf{Fl}(\mathrm{T}_\alpha, \mathbf{R})$. This invariant, which is trivial for all manifolds, arises as the core of the obstruction to the de Rham theorem in the diffeological setting. We provide a complete computation and geometric interpretation of this group, proving the isomorphism $\mathbf{Fl}(\mathrm{T}_\alpha, \mathbf{R}) \simeq \mathbf{R} \times \mathrm{coker}(\Delta_\alpha)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for establishing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. For any reflection positive frustration-free Hamiltonian, We proved that the local topological quantum order (LTQO) condition of ground states on a disk holds if and only if the ground state on the sphere is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we show that the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction produces the boundary local net of operator algebras from the local ground states.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices in entanglement: a novel idea for large vortex filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new approach to describing certain macroscopic objects
  that can arise in a quantum fluid. These objects are formed by means of quantum entanglement from the circular-shaped mesoscale and microscale vortices, and can be interpreted as a vortex filaments with any shape and size. The method is based on a quantization scheme for classical closed vortex filaments that was proposed by the author early \cite{Tal18,Tal22_1,Tal_Chaos25J}. The model we consider examines the instantaneous picture of the locations in space $\mathbb R_3$ of such filaments with a small, but non-zero, core diameter.
  Both energy and circulation of the studied filaments are calculated using the proposed approach. We demonstrate that the adopted concept leads to the emergence of secondary vortices around these investigated filament-like objects.
  We also study the specific mechanisms by which large vortex loops can disconnect and create the filament fragments . From our point of view, the proposed approach to describing vortex filaments within a vortex tangle can be seen as an important step toward understanding the appearance of quantum turbulence.</description>

      <title>Matrix approximations of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approximate representation of operators by finite matrices is analysed in terms of accuracy and convergence. The identity operator, for example, can be reconstructed using a basis of harmonic oscillator states leading to a narrow peak approximation of the $\delta$ function, but this peak may be perturbed by small, residual, oscillations. The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-\delta''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators.</description>

      <title>The semiclassical limit from the Pauli-Poisswell/Darwin to the Euler-Poisswell/Darwin system by WKB methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06660v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-consistent Pauli-Poisswell and Pauli-Darwin equations for 2-spinors are $O(1/c)$ (where $c$ denotes the speed of light) semi-relativistic approximations of the Dirac-Maxwell equation for 4-spinors coupled to the self-consistent electromagnetic fields generated by the charge and current densities of a fast moving electric charge. They consist of a vector-valued magnetic Schr\"odinger equation with the Stern-Gerlach term which couples spin and magnetic field, coupled to 1+3 Poisson equations as the magnetostatic approximation of Maxwell's equations.
  The Pauli-Poisswell and Pauli-Dariwn euqations are $O(1/c)$ models keeping both relativistic effects magnetism and spin, both of which are absent in the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation and inconsistent in the magnetic Schr\"odinger-Maxwell equation.
  We prove the local in time semiclassical limit $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ to the Euler-Poisswell equation and Euler-Darwin equations based on WKB analysis and energy estimates. Moreover we obtain weak convergence of the monokinetic Wigner transform to the monokinetic scalar Wigner measure solving the Vlasov-Poisswell and Vlasov-Darwin equations and strong convergence of the macroscopic densities. We introduce the Euler-Poisswell/Darwin equation and prove local wellposedness and a blow up alternative.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of KPZ limits arising from directed random walk models in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06073v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalized model of random walk in dynamical random environment, and we show that the multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation (SHE) describes the fluctuations of the quenched density at a certain precise location in the tail. The distribution of transition kernels is fixed rather than changing under the diffusive rescaling of space-time, i.e., there is no critical tuning of the model parameters when scaling to the stochastic PDE limit. The proof is done by pushing the methods developed in [arxiv 2304.14279, arXiv 2311.09151] to their maximum, substantially weakening the assumptions and obtaining fairly sharp conditions under which one expects to see the SHE arise in a wide variety of random walk models in random media. In particular we are able to get rid of conditions such as nearest-neighbor interaction as well as spatial independence of quenched transition kernels. Moreover, we observe an entire hierarchy of moderate deviation exponents at which the SHE can be found, confirming a physics prediction of J. Hass.</description>

      <title>Dagger $n$-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Category theory provides a unified language for organizing composable operations in many disciplines. In disciplines where unitarity is fundamental -- such as functional analysis, quantum field theory, and quantum logic -- this language must also capture adjoints, leading to the notion of dagger categories. Higher category theory, which extends this framework to encode operations between operations, has recently become indispensable in both theoretical physics and pure mathematics. Finding a higher categorical analogue of a dagger category is therefore key to the foundations of quantum field theory.
  In this work, we present a coherent definition of \emph{dagger $(\infty,n)$-category} in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$. This allows us to define (fully-local) \emph{reflection-positive topological quantum field theories} to be higher dagger functors out of $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$.</description>

Abstract: We prove local bounds on the amplitude of eigen- functions of complex constant-coefficient elliptic operators with a smooth potential on an arbitrary open subset of \R^d by estimating it in terms of the number of solutions of a diophantine inequality arising from the symbol of the operator. In the special case of positive elliptic operators, we recover H \"ormander's classical exponent up to an arbitrarily small loss. We show that a much better exponent may be obtained when the principal symbol of the oper- ator has complex coefficients. We generalize our estimate to any higher-order derivatives of eigenfunctions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the structure of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) for a class of exactly solvable models in the setting of a chain with left and right reservoirs. Inspired by recent results on the harmonic model, we focus on models in which the NESS is a mixture of equilibrium product measures, and where the probability measure which describes the mixture has a spatial Markovian property. We completely characterize the structure of such mixture measures, and show that under natural scaling and translation invariance properties, the only possible mixture measures are coinciding with the Dirichlet process found earlier in the context of the harmonic model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics to Abelian topological excitations of any dimension. We axiomatize excitations as a selected collection of states and operators satisfying the configuration axiom and the locality axiom, purely based on many-body quantum mechanics. Upon these axioms, we define a rigorous and self-contained theory of statistics using only basic algebra and can be implemented on a computer. While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-conservation of dark matter can lead to late-time cosmic acceleration. This mechanism is known as the matter creation theory and this replaces the need of dark energy and modified gravity theories. We consider a two-fluid system consisting of a cold dark matter and a second fluid with constant barotropic equation of state. We performed detailed investigations of such cosmologies using the powerful techniques of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. Considering a wide variety of the creation rates, we examine the phase space analysis of the individual scenario. According to our analyses, these scenarios predict decelerating unstable dark matter (or second fluid) dominated critical points, accelerating attractors dominated either by dark matter or the second fluid, accelerating scaling attractors in which dark matter and the second fluid co-exist. The regime of late-time accelerating expansion can be classified as either quintessence, phantom or driven by a cosmological constant. This huge variety of critical points makes these scenarios phenomenologically rich, and naturally suggests that such scenarios can be viewed as viable and potential alternatives to the mainstream cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Geometric Delocalization in Two Dimensions</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of transient two-dimensional surfaces where a random-walking particle escapes to infinity in contrast to localization in standard flat 2D space. We first prove that any rotationally symmetric 2D membrane embedded in flat 3D space cannot be transient. Then we formulate a criterion for the transience of a general asymmetric 2D membrane. We use it to explicitly construct a class of transient 2D manifolds with a non-trivial metric and height function but ``zero average curvature,'' which we dub tablecloth manifolds. The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

      <title>Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Bivariate multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type on the step-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies bivariate multiple orthogonal polynomials of the mixed type on the step-line. The analysis is based on the LU factorization of a moment matrix specifically adapted to this framework. The orthogonality and biorthogonality relations satisfied by these polynomials are identified, and their precise multi-degrees are determined. The corresponding recurrence relations and the growing band matrices that encode them are also derived. Christoffel-Darboux kernels and the associated Christoffel-Darboux-type formulas are obtained. An ABC-type theorem is established, relating the inverse of the truncated moment matrix to these kernels. As an illustration, the bivariate Jacobi-Pi\~neiro multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type on the triangle are computed by means of an LU factorization implemented in a dedicated Maple script.</description>

      <title>Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the $Z_{N}$ graded symmetry topological field theories and also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures.</description>

      <title>Infinite Interacting Brownian Motions and EVI Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition under which the time-marginal law of $\mu$-reversible infinite interacting Brownian motions is characterised as the steepest gradient descent of the relative entropy in the Wasserstein space in the sense of evolution variational inequality (EVI). This is an infinite-dimensional generalisation of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto/Ambrosio-Gigli-Savar\'e theory. Consequently, the configuration space (the space of locally finite point measures) endowed with the reversible measure $\mu$ is an RCD space and the time-marginal law is identified to the heat flow on this space. Our result covers the infinite-dimensional Dyson Brownian motion with bulk and soft-edge limits; the latter yields Airy line ensemble as its stationary process, a central object in KPZ universality. Our result therefore provides an optimal transport characterisation of these models as Wasserstein gradient flows, and establishes a range of new functional inequalities (HWI, distorted Brunn-Minkowski, dimension-free Harnack and many others) as a corollary. As an application, we discover the new phenomena, dynamical number rigidity and dynamical tail triviality, that the time-marginal law possesses number rigidity and tail triviality for every time $t&gt;0$, revealing a propagation of random crystal and extremal structures by the Dyson Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>Quantum state spectrum and field theory of D$0$-brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
  We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss and formalize topological means by which the initial singularity might be mollified, at the level of the spacetime manifold's structure, in classical cosmological models of a homogeneous expanding universe. One construction, dubbed a "reflective" topological big bang, generalizes Schrodinger's elliptic de Sitter space and is built to be compatible with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) picture of the large-scale universe, only minimally modifying it via some nontrivial topology at an earliest "moment" in the universe's history. We establish a mathematical characterization of the admissible topological structures of reflective topological big bangs, and we discuss implications for a standard concern in cosmology, the horizon problem. We present a nonreflective example that we've christened the Itty-Bitty Blender spacetime: this spacetime and its universal cover, the Eternal Trumpet spacetime, exhibit interesting potential structures of spacetimes avoiding the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems. While these toy models provide a proof-of-concept picture, several questions remain regarding the capacity to realize these structures under physical energy conditions.</description>

Abstract: We use martingale embeddings to prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for projections of high-dimensional random vectors satisfying a Poincar\'e inequality. We obtain a non-asymptotic error bound for the CLT in 2-Wasserstein distance involving two-point and three-point covariances. We present two illustrative applications to Ising models: one with finite-range interactions and the other in the ferromagnetic case under the Dobrushin condition.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of the Russo-Townsend formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the recent construction by Russo and Townsend, we propose a new approach to generate $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics. It is based on the use of two building blocks: (i) a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ depending on a duality-invariant parameter $g$; and (ii) an arbitrary potential $W(\psi)$, with $\psi$ an auxiliary scalar field. It turns out that the model $\mathfrak{L}(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) = L(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) + W(\psi)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $\psi$. As an illustration, we work out an example in which the seed Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ corresponds to the Born-Infeld model and a particular potential $W(\psi)$ is chosen such that integrating $\psi$ out gives the ModMaxBorn theory. We also briefly discuss supersymmetric generalisations of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of the Koopman operator recovers Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and controlling open quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</description>
