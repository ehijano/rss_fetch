      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Identifying Steady-State Behavior in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex systems, information propagation can be defined as diffused or delocalized, weakly localized, and strongly localized. Can a machine learning model learn the behavior of a linear dynamical system on networks? In this work, we develop a graph neural network framework for identifying the steady-state behavior of the linear dynamical system. We reveal that our model learns the different states with high accuracy. To understand the explainability of our model, we provide an analytical derivation for the forward and backward propagation of our framework. Finally, we use the real-world graphs in our model for validation.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Link Prediction via Hyperedge Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>

      <title>Operator-theoretic Analysis of Mutual Interactions in Synchronized Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing synchronized nonlinear oscillators is one of the most important and attractive topics in nonlinear science. By understanding the interactions between the oscillators, we can figure out the synchronization process. A promising approach to the analysis of interacting oscillators in nonlinear science is the application of the phase model. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to extract mutual interactions of synchronized oscillators based on the phase model. Recently, applying machine learning techniques to estimate models in physics has been actively investigated. We propose an operator-theoretic approach to estimate the phase model of interacting oscillators. We reduce the estimation problem to a multiparameter eigenvalue problem of the Koopman operator, a linear operator that describes a dynamical system. By reducing the problem to a linear algebraic problem, we can theoretically show that the proposed approach is stable with respect to perturbations in the given data.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of two bacterial flagella as a stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization with noise is important for understanding biophysical processes at nano- and micro-meter scales, such as neuron firing and beating of cilia. To understand the energetics of these processes, stochastic thermodynamics approaches are useful. Due to large fluctuations in a small system, emsemble averages of thermodynamic quantities are not sufficient to characterize the energetics of an individual sample. In this paper, we use a model for synchronization of bacterial flagella as an example, and develop an approximation method for analyzing the phase and heat dissipation in trajectories for different noise realizations. We describe the time development of the phase difference and heat dissipation as stochastic processes, and verify the analytical results by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay mathematical foundations for the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and mechanical effects in dense settings. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</description>
