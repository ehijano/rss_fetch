      <title>Disorder-induced instability of a Weyl nodal loop semimetal towards a diffusive topological metal with protected multifractal surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl nodal loop semimetals are gapless topological phases that, unlike their insulator counterparts, may be unstable to small perturbations that respect their topology-protecting symmetries. Here, we analyze a clean system perturbed by chiral off-diagonal disorder using numerically exact methods. We establish that the ballistic semimetallic phase is unstable towards the formation of an unconventional topological diffusive metal hosting topological multifractal surface states. Although, as in the clean case, surface states are exponentially localized along the direction perpendicular to the nodal loop, disorder induces a multifractal structure in the remaining directions. Surprisingly, the number of these states also increases with a small amount of disorder. Eventually, as disorder is further increased, the number of surface states starts decreasing. In the strong disordered regime we predict that some types of disorder induce an Anderson transition into an electrically-polarized insulator whose signature may be detected experimentally.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. However, little is known about the stability of quasicrystalline phases to long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Simulating adiabatic quantum computation with a variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical analysis of the Adiabatic Quantum Computation protocol presents several challenges resulting from the difficulty of simulating, with classical resources, the unitary dynamics of a large quantum device. We present here a variational approach to substantially alleviate this problem in many situations of interest. Our approach is based on the time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo method, in conjunction with a correlated and time-dependent Jastrow ansatz. We demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained in a variety of problems, ranging from the description of defect generation through a dynamical phase transition in 1D to the complex dynamics of frustrated spin-glass problems both on fully-connected and Chimera graphs.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic and periodic extended Hatano-Nelson model: Anomalous localization transition and non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of quasiperiodic and periodic onsite potentials in a Hatano-Nelson model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping. By considering a non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbour hopping and a quasiperiodic onsite potential under periodic boundary conditions, we show a breakdown of the typical correspondence between the delocalization-localization and complex-real transitions as a function of the potential strength. Moreover, we reveal that in the delocalized regime, when the potential strength increases, the eigenstates under OBC exhibit a bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., they tend to localize on both the edges instead of localizing on either of the edges. However, when a periodic onsite potential is considered, the system not only exhibits a bipolar skin effect, but also shows a complete direction reversal of the skin effect as a function of the onsite periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Les Houches Lectures on Community Ecology: From Niche Theory to Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ecosystems are among the most interesting and well-studied examples of self-organized complex systems. Community ecology, the study of how species interact with each other and the environment, has a rich tradition. Over the last few years, there has been a growing theoretical and experimental interest in these problems from the physics and quantitative biology communities. Here, we give an overview of community ecology, highlighting the deep connections between ecology and statistical physics. We start by introducing the two classes of mathematical models that have served as the workhorses of community ecology: Consumer Resource Models (CRM) and the generalized Lotka-Volterra models (GLV). We place a special emphasis on graphical methods and general principles. We then review recent works showing a deep and surprising connection between ecological dynamics and constrained optimization. We then shift our focus by analyzing these same models in "high-dimensions" (i.e. in the limit where the number of species and resources in the ecosystem becomes large) and discuss how such complex ecosystems can be analyzed using methods from the statistical physics of disordered systems such as the cavity method and Random Matrix Theory.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the slow component in timescale separated synchronized oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physiological networks are usually made of a large number of biological oscillators evolving on a multitude of different timescales. Phase oscillators are particularly useful in the modelling of the synchronization dynamics of such systems. If the coupling is strong enough compared to the heterogeneity of the internal parameters, synchronized states might emerge where phase oscillators start to behave coherently. Here, we focus on the case where synchronized oscillators are divided into a fast and a slow component so that the two subsets evolve on separated timescales. We assess the resilience of the slow component by reducing the dynamics of the fast one and evaluating the variance of the phase deviations when the oscillators in the two components are subject to noise with possibly distinct correlation times. From the general expression for the variance, we consider specific network structures and show how the noise transmission between the fast and slow components is affected. Interestingly, we find that oscillators that are among the most robust when there is only a single timescale, might become the most vulnerable when the system separates into two timescales. We also find that layered networks seem to be insensitive to timescale separations when the noise has homogeneous correlation time.</description>

      <title>Features of a spin glass in the random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A longstanding open question in the theory of disordered systems is whether short-range models, such as the random field Ising model or the Edwards-Anderson model, can indeed have the famous properties that characterize mean-field spin glasses at nonzero temperature. This article shows that this is at least partially possible in the case of the random field Ising model. Consider the Ising model on a discrete $d$-dimensional cube under free boundary condition, subjected to a very weak i.i.d. random external field, where the field strength is inversely proportional to the square-root of the number of sites. It turns out that in $d\ge 2$ and at subcritical temperatures, this model has some of the key features of a mean-field spin glass. Namely, (a) the site overlap exhibits one step of replica symmetry breaking, (b) the quenched distribution of the overlap is non-self-averaging, and (c) the overlap has the Parisi ultrametric property. Furthermore, it is shown that for Gaussian disorder, replica symmetry does not break if the field strength is taken to be stronger than the one prescribed above, and non-self-averaging fails if it is weaker, showing that the above order of field strength is the only one that allows all three properties to hold. However, the model does not have two other features of mean-field models. Namely, (a) it does not satisfy the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities, and (b) it has only two pure states instead of many.</description>
