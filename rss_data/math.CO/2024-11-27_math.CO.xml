      <title>Laplacian Spectrum of Super Graphs defined on Certain Non-abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $A$ on a group $G$ and an equivalence relation $B$ on $G$, the $B$ super$A$ graph, whose vertex set is $G$ and two vertices $g$, $h$ are adjacent if and only if there exist $g^{\prime} \in[g]$ and $h^{\prime} \in[h]$ such that $g^{\prime}$ and $h^{\prime}$ are adjacent in $A$. Recently, Dalal \emph{et al.} (Spectrum of super commuting graphs of some finite groups, \textit{Computational and Applied Mathematics}, 43(6):348, 2024) obtain the Laplacian spectrum of supercommuting graphs of certain non-abelian groups including the dihedral group and the generalized quaternion group. In this paper, we continue the study of Laplacian spectrum of certian $B$ super$A$ graphs. We obtain the Laplacian spectrum of conjugacy superenhanced power graphs of certain non-abelian groups, namely: dihedral group, generalized quaternion group and semidihedral group. Moreover to enhance the work of Dalal \emph{et al}, we obtain the Laplacian spectrum of conjugacy supercommuting graph of semidihedral group. We prove that graphs considered in this paper are $L$-integral.</description>

      <title>A resolution of the Aharoni-Korman conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A poset $P$ is said to satisfy the finite antichain condition, or FAC for short, if it has no infinite antichain. It was conjectured by Aharoni and Korman in 1992 that any FAC poset $P$ possesses a chain $C$ and a partition into antichains such that $C$ meets every antichain of the partition. Our main results are twofold. We provide a counterexample to the conjecture in full generality, but, despite this, we also prove that the conjecture does hold true for a broad class of posets. In particular, we prove that the Aharoni-Korman conjecture holds for countable posets avoiding intervals $I$ such that either $I$ or its reverse $I^*$ is of the form $\bigoplus_{x\in\omega} Q_x$, where each $Q_x$ is infinite and co-wellfounded.
  In pursuit of these goals, we also investigate other facets of the structure of FAC posets. In particular, we consider strongly maximal chains in FAC posets, proving some results, and posing several questions and conjectures.</description>

      <title>On cubic polycirculant nut graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nut graph is a nontrivial simple graph whose adjacency matrix contains a one-dimensional null space spanned by a vector without zero entries. Moreover, an $\ell$-circulant graph is a graph that admits a cyclic group of automorphisms having $\ell$ vertex orbits of equal size. It is not difficult to observe that there exists no cubic $1$-circulant nut graph or cubic $2$-circulant nut graph, while the full classification of all the cubic $3$-circulant nut graphs was recently obtained [Electron. J. Comb. 31(2) (2024), #2.31]. Here, we investigate the existence of cubic $\ell$-circulant nut graphs for $\ell \ge 4$ and show that there is no cubic $4$-circulant nut graph or cubic $5$-circulant nut graph by using a computer-assisted proof. Furthermore, we rely on a construction based approach in order to demonstrate that there exist infinitely many cubic $\ell$-circulant nut graphs for any fixed $\ell \in \{6, 7 \}$ or $\ell \ge 9$.</description>

      <title>C sequential optimization numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a definition that is more basic than the previous ones, for the Stirling numbers of first kind, which is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the previous definition. Based on this definition and a combinatorial problem, we discover C sequential optimization numbers, where C is a k+1-tuple vector. For C= (0,1), we prove that C sequential optimization numbers are the unsigned Stirling numbers of first kind. We can deduce the properties of C sequential optimization numbers by following the properties of the Stirling numbers of first kind and we give specific examples such as the recurrence formula and an instance of C sequential optimization numbers. We also give specific new properties such as an explicit upper bound of them. We prove the probability that the unsigned Stirling numbers of first kind are concentrated in O(logn) is nearly 100%.</description>

      <title>Excess Coverage Arrays and Levenshtein's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence covering array, denoted \textsf{SCA}$(N;t,v)$, is a set of $N$ permutations of $\{0, \dots, v-1 \}$ such that each sequence of $t$ distinct elements of $\{0, \dots, v-1\}$ reads left to right in at least one permutation. The minimum number of permutations such a sequence covering array can have is $t!$ and Levenshtein conjectured that if a sequence covering array with $t!$ permutations exists, then $v \in \{t,t+1\}$. In this paper, we prove that if an \textsf{SCA}$(7!;7,v)$ exists, then $v \leq 9$. We do this by analysing connections between sequence covering arrays and a special kind of covering array called an excess coverage array. A strength 2 excess coverage array, denoted \textsf{CA}$_{X}(N;2,k,v)$, is an $N \times k$ array with entries from $\{0, \dots, v - 1\}$ such that every ordered pair of distinct symbols appear at least once in each pair of columns and all other pairs appear at least twice. We demonstrate computationally that there is a unique \textsf{CA}$_{X}(42;2,5,6)$, and we prove that this array alone does not satisfy necessary conditions we establish for the existence of an \textsf{SCA}$(7!;7,10)$. Furthermore, we find the maximum possible number of columns for strength 2 excess coverage arrays with symbol sets of sizes between 2 and 6, and more broadly investigate binary excess coverage arrays.</description>

      <title>On Bollob\'as-type theorems of $d$-tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1965, Bollob\'as proved that for a Bollob\'as set-pair system $\{(A_i,B_i)\mid i\in[m]\}$, the maximum value of $\sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i|+|B_i|}{A_i}^{-1}$ is $1$. In 2023, Heged\"{u}s and Frankl generalize the concept of Bollob\'as system to $d$-tuples, and made a conjecture: Suppose $\{(A_i^{(1)},\ldots,A_i^{(d)})\mid i\in[m]\}$ is a Bollob\'as system of $d$-tuples, the maximum value of $\sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i^{(1)}|+\cdots+|A_i^{(d)}|}{|A_i^{(1)}|,\ldots,|A_i^{(d)}|}^{-1}$ is also $1$. In this paper, we show this conjecture is not correct, and we give an upper bound of it. In the case $d=3$, our upper bound is tight in the mean of asymptotic. We also improve an inequality for skew Bollob\'as systems of $d$-tuples of Heged\"{u}s and Frankl, and determine the maximum size or a uniform skew Bollob\'as system.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components of two-column $\Delta$-Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Delta$-Springer fibers $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$, introduced by Levinson, Woo, and the second author, generalize Springer fibers for $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and give a geometric interpretation of the of the Delta Conjecture from algebraic combinatorics (at $t=0$). We prove that all irreducible components of the $\Delta$-Springer fiber $Y_{n,n-1}=Y_{n,(1^{n-1}),n-1}$ are smooth. In fact, we prove that any intersection of irreducible components of $Y_{n,n-1}$ is a smooth Hessenberg variety which has the structure of an iterated Grassmannian fiber bundle. We then give a presentation of the singular cohomology ring of each irreducible component of $Y_{n,n-1}$ and a combinatorial formula for the Poincar\'e polynomial of an arbitrary union of intersections of irreducible components in terms of arm and leg statistics on Dyck paths.</description>

      <title>On decomposition thresholds for odd-length cycles and other tripartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An (edge) decomposition of a graph $G$ is a set of subgraphs of $G$ whose edge sets partition the edge set of $G$. Here we show, for each odd $\ell \geq 5$, that any graph $G$ of sufficiently large order $n$ with minimum degree at least $(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2\ell-4}+o(1))n$ has a decomposition into $\ell$-cycles if and only if $\ell$ divides $|E(G)|$ and each vertex of $G$ has even degree. This threshold cannot be improved beyond $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2\ell-2}$. It was previously shown that the thresholds approach $\frac{1}{2}$ as $\ell$ becomes large, but our thresholds do so significantly more rapidly. Our methods can be applied to tripartite graphs more generally and we also obtain some bounds for decomposition thresholds of other tripartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Special orientable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, Orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., recursive methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets, requiring 'starter sequences' with special properties. Some of these methods required as input special orientable sequences, i.e. orientable sequences which were simultaneously negative orientable. We exhibit methods for constructing special orientable sequences with properties appropriate for use in two of the recursive methods of Alhakim et al. As a result we are able to show how to construct special orientable sequences for arbitrary sizes of alphabet (larger than a small lower bound) and for all window sizes. These sequences have periods asymptotic to the optimal as the alphabet size increases.</description>

      <title>Cubic bricks that every b-invariant edge is forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected graph G is matching covered if every edge lies in some perfect matching of G. Lovasz proved that every matching covered graph G can be uniquely decomposed into a list of bricks (nonbipartite) and braces (bipartite) up to multiple edges. Denote by b(G) the number of bricks of G. An edge e of G is removable if G-e is also matching covered, and solitary (or forcing) if after the removal of the two end vertices of e, the left graph has a unique perfect matching. Furthermore, a removable edge e of a brick G is b-invariant if b(G-e) = 1.
  Lucchesi and Murty proposed a problem of characterizing bricks, distinct from K4, the prism and the Petersen graph, in which every b-invariant edge is forcing. We answer the problem for cubic bricks by showing that there are exactly ten cubic bricks, including K4, the prism and the Petersen graph, every b-invariant edge of which is forcing.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an numbers of cycles plus a general graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family of graphs $\cal F$, a graph $G$ is $\cal F$-free if it does not contain a member of $\cal F$ as a subgraph. The Tur\'an number $\textrm{ex}(n,{\cal F})$ is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph which is $\cal F$-free. Let ${\cal C}_{\geq k}$ be the set of cycles with length at least $k$. In this paper, we investigate the Tur\'an number of $\{{\cal C}_{\geq k}, F\}$ for a general graph $F$. To be precise, we determine $\textrm{ex}(n, \{{\cal C}_{\geq k}, F\})$ apart from a constant additive term, where $F$ either is a 2-connected nonbipartite graph or is a 2-connected bipartite graph under some conditions. This is an extension of a previous result on the Tur\'an number of $\{{\cal C}_{\geq k}, K_r\}$ by the first author, Ning, and the third author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the general outlines of a method for obtaining analytic expressions for certain types of general arithmetical sums. In particular, analytical expressions for a general arithmetical sum whose terms are summed over either the positive integer solutions $(a,b)$ of the Diophantine equation $kb^2+da^2 = N$ or the positive integer solutions $(a,b)$ of the Diophantine equation $kb^2-da^2 = N$ are derived. As one of the consequences, we propose a possible improvement of the Robin-Lagarias criteria for the Riemann hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Computational methods for finding bi-regular cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $(\{r,m\};g)$-graph is a (simple, undirected) graph of girth $g\geq3$ with vertices of degrees $r$ and $m$ where $2 \leq r &lt; m$ . Given $r,m,g$, we seek the $(\{r,m\};g)$-graphs of minimum order, called $(\{r,m\};g)$-cages or bi-regular cages, whose order is denoted by $n(\{r,m\};g)$. In this paper, we use computational methods for finding $(\{r,m\};g)$-graphs of small order. Firstly, we present an exhaustive generation algorithm, which leads to $\unicode{x2013}$ previously unknown $\unicode{x2013}$ exhaustive lists of $(\{r,m\};g)$-cages for 24 different triples $(r,m,g)$. This also leads to the improvement of the lower bound of $n(\{4,5\};7)$ from 66 to 69. Secondly, we improve 49 upper bounds of $n(\{r,m\};g)$ based on constructions that start from $r$-regular graphs. Lastly, we generalize a theorem by Aguilar, Araujo-Pardo and Berman [arXiv:2305.03290, 2023], leading to 73 additional improved upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Characterizing graphs with high inducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$ and a graph $H$ on $k$ vertices, we are interested in the inducibility of $H$, denoted $\mathrm{ind}(H)$, which is defined as the maximum possible probability that choosing $k$ vertices uniformly at random from a large graph $G$, they induce a copy of $H$. It follows from the resolved Edge-statistics conjecture that if $H \not \in \{K_k, \bar K_k\}$, then $\mathrm{ind}(H) \leq 1 / e + o_k(1)$. Equality holds for the star graph $K_{1, k-1}$, the graph with a single edge on $k$ vertices and their complements. We prove that for all other graphs $H$, we have $\mathrm{ind}(H) \leq c + o_k(1)$ for an absolute constant $c &lt; 1 / e$. Moreover, we explicitly characterize all graphs with inducibility bounded away from zero. Namely, we show that this is the class of graphs $H$ for which there is a set $V_0 \subseteq V(H)$ of bounded size with the property that all permutations of $V(H) \backslash V_0$ extend to an automorphism of $H$.</description>

      <title>Nonregular graphs with a given maximum degree attaining maximum spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected nonregular graphs of order $n$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ that attains the maximum spectral radius. Liu and Li (2008) proposed a conjecture stating that $G$ has a degree sequence $(\Delta,\ldots,\Delta,\delta)$ with $\delta&lt;\Delta$. For $\Delta=3$ and $\Delta=4$, Liu (2024) confirmed this conjecture by characterizing the structure of such graphs. Liu also proposed a modified version of the conjecture for fixed $\Delta$ and sufficiently large $n$, stating that the above $\delta=\Delta-1$ if $\Delta$ and $n$ are both odd, $\delta=1$ if $\Delta$ is odd and $n$ is even, and $\delta=\Delta-2$ if $\Delta$ is even. For the cases where $\Delta=n-2$ with $n\ge 5$, and $\Delta=n-3$ with $n\ge 59$, we fully characterize the structure of $G$.</description>

      <title>Element-Distinct Solution For Rado's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simplified proof of Rado's Theorem and demonstrate that when an integer matrix $M$ satisfies the column condition and $M\mathbf x=\mathbf 0$ has an element-distinct solution on $\mathbb N$, then under any finite coloring of $\mathbb N$, the equation $M\mathbf x=\mathbf 0$ has a monochromatic element-distinct solution. This gives a positive answer to a problem of Di Nasso in 2016.</description>

      <title>Mis\`ere Cricket Pitch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mis\`ere games in general have little algebraic structure, but if the games under consideration have properties then some algebraic structure re-appears. In 2023, the class of Blocking games was identified. Mis\`ere Cricket Pitch was suggested as a problem at the Games-at-Dal-2023 Workshop, and is the first game in this class to be studied. Normal play Cricket Pitch was analyzed in 2011.
  The game involves flattening `bumps' with a roller. The main reduction of normal play, reducing every bump by $2$, is not applicable in mis\`ere play.
  In this paper, we find the outcomes of single (linear) component \textsc{cricket pitch} positions, where
  the proof is based on first considering the bumps to the left and to the right of the roller separately. We also give reductions, true in Blocking games in general, of positions that occur in simple positions of Cricket Pitch. These allow us to find the outcomes of the disjunctive sum of single bump positions. At the time of writing, it was not possible to find game values since the relevant theory for Blocking games does not exist.</description>

      <title>Partition regularity of homogeneous quadratics: Current trends and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose we partition the integers into finitely many cells. Can we always find a solution of the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$ with $x,y,z$ on the same cell? What about more general homogeneous quadratic equations in three variables? These are basic questions in arithmetic Ramsey theory, which have recently been partially answered using ideas inspired by ergodic theory and tools such as Gowers-uniformity properties and concentration estimates of bounded multiplicative functions. The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to this exciting research area, explaining the main ideas behind the recent progress and some of the important challenges that lie ahead.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the cardinality of Grobner basis under various orderings. We identify a family of polynomials F and a criteria for the monomial orderings such that the reduced Grobner basis is double exponential in cardinality.

      <description>arXiv:2411.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: P\'olya trees are rooted, unlabeled trees on $n$ vertices. This paper gives an efficient, new way to generate P\'olya trees. This allows comparing typical unlabeled and labeled tree statistics and comparing asymptotic theorems with `reality'.
  Along the way, we give a product formula for the number of rooted labeled trees preserved by a given automorphism; this refines Cayley's formula.</description>

      <title>A universal characterization of the shifted plactic monoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plactic monoid $\mathbf{P}$ of Lascoux and Sch\"{u}tzenberger (1981) plays an important role in proofs of the Littlewood-Richardson rule for computing multiplicities in the linear representation theory of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ and the cohomology of Grassmannians. Commonly, $\mathbf{P}$ is defined as a quotient of a free monoid by relations derived from a careful analysis of Schensted's insertion algorithm and the jeu de taquin algorithm on semistandard Young tableaux. However, Lascoux and Sch\"{u}tzenberger also gave an intrinsic characterization of $\mathbf{P}$ via a universal property.
  Serrano's (2010) shifted plactic monoid $\mathbf{S}$ is an analogue of $\mathbf{P}$ that governs instead the projective representation theory of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ and the cohomology of isotropic Grassmannians. We provide a universal property for $\mathbf{S}$, analogous to the Lascoux-Sch\"{u}tzenberger characterization of $\mathbf{P}$.</description>

      <title>Intervals in a family of Fibonacci lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on a family of subsets $(\F^p_n)_{p\geq 2}$ of Dyck paths of semilength $n$ that avoid the patterns $DUU$ and $D^{p+1}$, which are enumerated by the generalized Fibonacci numbers. We endow them with the partial order relation induced by the well-known Stanley lattice, and we prove that all these posets are sublattices of the Stanley lattice. We provide generating functions for the numbers of linear and boolean intervals and we deduce the M\"obius function for every $p\geq 2$. We count meet-irreducible elements in $\FF_n^p$ which establishes a surprising link with the edges of the $(n,p)$-Tur\'an graph. We also prove that intervals are in one-to-one correspondence with bicolored Motzkin paths avoiding some patterns, which allows to enumerate intervals for $p=2$. Using a discrete continuity argument ($p\rightarrow \infty$), we present a similar enumerative study in a poset of some Dyck paths of semilength $n$ counted by $2^{n-1}$. Finally, we give bijections that transport the lattice structure on other combinatorial objects, proving that those lattices can be seen as the well-known dominance order on some compositions.</description>

      <title>Pentagonal number recurrence relations for $p(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Euler's partition function recurrence, which asserts, for integers $n\geq 1,$ that $$ p(n)=p(n-1)+p(n-2)-p(n-5)-p(n-7)+\dots = \sum_{k\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}} (-1)^{k+1} p(n-\omega(k)), $$ where $\omega(m):=(3m^2+m)/2$ is the $m$th pentagonal number. We prove that this classical result is the $\nu=0$ case of an infinite family of ``pentagonal number'' recurrences. For each $\nu\geq 0,$ we prove for positive $n$ that
  $$ p(n)=\frac{1}{g_{\nu}(n,0)}\left(\alpha_{\nu}\cdot \sigma_{2\nu-1}(n)+ \mathrm{Tr}_{2\nu}(n) +\sum_{k\in \mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}} (-1)^{k+1} g_{\nu}(n,k)\cdot p(n-\omega(k))\right), $$ where $\sigma_{2\nu-1}(n)$ is a divisor function, $\mathrm{Tr}_{2\nu}(n)$ is the $n$th weight $2\nu$ Hecke trace of values of special twisted quadratic Dirichlet series, and each $g_{\nu}(n,k)$ is a polynomial in $n$ and $k.$ The $\nu=6$ case can be viewed as a partition theoretic formula for Ramanujan's tau-function, as we have $$ \mathrm{Tr}_{12}(n)=-\frac{33108590592}{691}\cdot \tau(n). $$</description>

      <title>Some asymptotic results on $p$-lengths of factorizations for numerical semigroups and arithmetical congruence monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A factorization of an element $x$ in a monoid $(M, \cdot)$ is an expression of the form $x = u_1^{z_1} \cdots u_k^{z_k}$ for irreducible elements $u_1, \ldots, u_k \in M$, and the length of such a factorization is $z_1 + \cdots + z_k$. We introduce the notion of $p$-length, a generalized notion of factorization length obtained from the $\ell_p$-norm of the sequence $(z_1, \ldots, z_k)$, and present asymptotic results on extremal $p$-lengths of factorizations for large elements of numerical semigroups (additive submonoids of $\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$) and arithmetical congruence monoids (certain multiplicative submonoids of $\mathbb Z_{\ge 1}$). Our results, inspired by analogous results for classical factorization length, demonstrate the types of combinatorial statements one may hope to obtain for sufficiently nice monoids, as well as the subtlety such asymptotic questions can have for general monoids.</description>

      <title>On the first hitting time of a high-dimensional orthant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a collection of independent standard Brownian particles (or random walks), starting from a configuration where at least one particle is positive, and study the first time they all become negative. This is clearly equivalent to studying the first hitting time from the negative orthant or the first exit time from the complement of the negative orthant. While it turns out to be possible to compute the distribution of these hitting times for one and two particles, the distribution (and even its tail asymptotics) is not known in closed form for three or more particles. In this paper we study the tail asymptotics of the distribution as the number of particles tends to infinity. Our main techniques come from spectral geometry: we prove new asymptotic estimates for the principal eigenvalue of the complement of a high-dimensional orthant, which we believe are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>S-invariant and S-multinvariant functions and some symmetry groups of algebraic sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduced algebraic sieves, i.e. selection procedures on a given finite set to extract a particular subset. Such procedures are performed by finite groups acting on the set. They are called sieves because there are certain sets of numbers which, with appropriate groups, can select, for example, a set of primes, think of the famous Eratosthenes sieve. In this article we have given a general definition of algebraic sieves. And we also introduced the notion of invariant and multi-invariant functions, certain permutations on the sieve set which, in the invariant case, commute with the action of a given sieve-selecting group and the automorphism of that group, and multi-invariants which commute with all groups and their respective automorphisms. By means of such functions we have given symmetries on such sieves. In particular, we studied certain groups of symmetries of invariant functions. Then, using such notions, we studied a particular example, the Goldbach sieve, where the selector groups are dihedral groups and the selected set consists of the primes and, in some cases, the numbers $1$ and $N-1=p$, with $N$ being even and p prime, which satisfies the Goldbach conjecture for $N$. We have shown that one of these symmetry groups is isomorphic to a subgroup or affinity group of the ring of integers modulo N with N an integer even $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$.</description>

      <title>Measure doubling in unimodular locally compact groups and quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a (possibly discrete) unimodular locally compact group $G$ with Haar measure $\mu_G$, and a compact $A\subseteq G$ of positive measure with $\mu_G(A^2)\leq K\mu_G(A)$. Let $H$ be a closed normal subgroup of G and $\pi: G \rightarrow G/H$ be the quotient map. With the further assumption that $A= A^{-1}$, we show $$\mu_{G/H}(\pi A ^2) \leq K^2 \mu_{G/H}(\pi A).$$ We also demonstrate that $K^2$ cannot be replaced by $(1-\epsilon)K^2$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$.
  In the general case (without $A=A^{-1}$), we show $\mu_{G/H}(\pi A ^2) \leq K^3 \mu_{G/H}(\pi A)$, improving an earlier result by An, Jing, Zhang, and the third author. Moreover, we are able to extract a compact set $B\subseteq A$ with $\mu_G(B)&gt; \mu_G(A)/2$ such that $ \mu_{G/H}(\pi B^2) &lt; 2K \mu_{G/H}(\pi B)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection numbers of moduli spaces of stable curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,m}$ are well-studied and are known to have rich combinatorial structure. We introduce a natural class of these intersection numbers $\omega_{G,g,m}$ indexed by finite simple graphs $G=(V,E)$. In genus zero, these numbers are closely related to several previously-studied quantities, including maximum likelihood degrees in algebraic statistics, counts of regions of certain hyperplane arrangements, and Kapranov degrees. We give two proofs of a simple closed formula $\omega_{G,g,m}=(-1)^{\left\lvert V \right\rvert}\chi_G(-(2g-2+m)),$ where $\chi_G$ is the chromatic polynomial of $G$ -- one proof via intersection theory on moduli spaces of stable curves, and the other using the theory of hyperplane arrangements. We discuss several related questions and speculations, including new candidates for the chromatic polynomial of a directed graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equivariant cohomology classes of torus-equivariant subvarieties of the space of matrices. For a large class of torus actions, we prove that the polynomials representing these classes (up to suitably changing signs) are covolume polynomials in the sense of Aluffi. We study the cohomology rings of complex varieties in terms of Macaulay inverse systems over $\mathbb{Z}$. As applications, we show that under certain conditions, the Macaulay dual generator is a denormalized Lorentzian polynomial in the sense of Br\"and\'en and Huh, and we give a characteristic-free extension (over $\mathbb{Z}$) of the result of Khovanskii and Pukhlikov describing the cohomology ring of toric varieties in terms of volume polynomials.</description>

      <title>Cheeger inequalities on simplicial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cheeger-type inequalities in which the decomposability of a graph and the spectral gap of its Laplacian mutually control each other play an important role in graph theory and network analysis, in particular in the context of expander theory. The natural problem to extend such inequalities to simplicial complexes and their higher order Eckmann Laplacians has been open for a long time. Before proving any inequality, however, one needs to identify the right Cheeger-type constant for which such an inequality can hold. Here, we solve this problem. Our solution involves and combines constructions from simplicial topology, signed graphs, Gromov filling radii and an interpolation between the standard 2-Laplacians and the analytically more difficult 1-Laplacians, for which, however, the inequalities become equalities. It is then natural to develop a general theory for $p$-Laplacians on simplicial complexes and investigate the related Cheeger-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Apex Graphs and Cographs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs is called hereditary if it is closed under taking induced subgraphs. We denote by $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{apex}$ the class of graphs $G$ that contain a vertex $v$ such that $G-v$ is in $\mathcal{G}$. We prove that if a hereditary class $\mathcal{G}$ has finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs, then so does $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{apex}$.
  The hereditary class of cographs consists of all graphs $G$ that can be generated from $K_1$ using complementation and disjoint union. A graph is an apex cograph if it contains a vertex whose deletion results in a cograph. Cographs are precisely the graphs that do not have the $4$-vertex path as an induced subgraph. Our main result finds all such forbidden induced subgraphs for the class of apex cographs.</description>

      <title>On quasi-Hermitian varieties in even characteristic and related orthogonal arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the BM quasi-Hermitian varieties introduced in [A. Aguglia, A. Cossidente, G. Korchm\`aros, On quasi-Hermitian Varieties, J. Combin. Des. 20 (2012) 433-447.] in characteristc $2$ and dimension $3$. After a brief investigation of their combinatorial properties, we first show that all of these varieties are projectively equivalent, exhibiting a behavior which is strikingly different from what happens in odd characteristic, see [A. Aguglia, L. Giuzzi, On the equivalence of certain quasi-Hermitian varieties, J. Combin. Des. 1-15 (2022)]. This completes the classification project started in that paper. Here we prove more; indeed, by using previous results, we explicitly determine the structure of the full collineation group stabilizing these varieties. Finally, as a byproduct of our investigation, we also construct a family of simple orthogonal arrays $O(q^5,q^4,q,2)$, with entries in $\mathrm{GF}{q}$, where $q$ is an even prime power. Orthogonal arrays (OA's) are principally used to minimize the number of experiments needed in order to investigate how variables in testing interact with each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph contains a Hamilton cycle for sufficiently large $n$, assuming that $d\geq \log^{6}n$ and $\lambda\leq cd$, where $c=\frac{1}{70000}$. This significantly improves a recent result of Glock, Correia and Sudakov, who obtained a similar result for $d$ that grows polynomially with $n$. The proof is based on a new result regarding the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a subgraph induced by a random subset of vertices, combined with a recent result on connecting designated pairs of vertices by vertex-disjoint paths in $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs. We believe that the former result is of independent interest and will have further applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concepts of an amazing hypercube decomposition and a double shortcut for it, and use these new ideas to formulate a conjecture implying the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials for the symmetric group. This conjecture has the advantage of being combinatorial in nature. The appendix by Grant T. Barkley and Christian Gaetz discusses the related notion of double hypercubes and proves an analogous conjecture for these in the case of co-elementary intervals.</description>

Abstract: A tight $\ell$-cycle minus an edge $C_\ell^-$ is the $3$-graph on the vertex set $[\ell]$, where any three consecutive vertices in the string $123\ldots\ell 1$ form an edge. We show that for every $\ell\ge 5$, $\ell$ not divisible by $3$, the extremal number is
  $
  ex\left(C_\ell^-,n\right)=\tfrac1{24}n^3+O(n\ln n)=\left(\tfrac14+o(1)\right){n\choose 3}.
  $

      <description>arXiv:2410.13129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate properties of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix and a Hankel matrix by studying the components of its graph. To this end, we introduce the notion of ``weighted Toeplitz graph" and ``weighted Hankel graph", which are weighted graphs whose adjacency matrix are a symmetric Toeplitz matrix and a Hankel matrix, respectively. By studying the components of a weighted Toeplitz graph, we show that the Frobenius normal form of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix is a direct sum of symmetric irreducible Toeplitz matrices. Similarly, by studying the components of a weighted Hankel matrix, we show that the Frobenius normal form of a Hankel matrix is a direct sum of irreducible Hankel matrices.</description>

      <title>Expected Density of Random Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimizer schemes, or just minimizers, are a very important computational primitive in sampling and sketching biological strings. Assuming a fixed alphabet of size $\sigma$, a minimizer is defined by two integers $k,w\ge2$ and a total order $\rho$ on strings of length $k$ (also called $k$-mers). A string is processed by a sliding window algorithm that chooses, in each window of length $w+k-1$, its minimal $k$-mer with respect to $\rho$. A key characteristic of the minimizer is the expected density of chosen $k$-mers among all $k$-mers in a random infinite $\sigma$-ary string. Random minimizers, in which the order $\rho$ is chosen uniformly at random, are often used in applications. However, little is known about their expected density $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ besides the fact that it is close to $\frac{2}{w+1}$ unless $w\gg k$.
  We first show that $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ can be computed in $O(k\sigma^{k+w})$ time. Then we attend to the case $w\le k$ and present a formula that allows one to compute $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ in just $O(w \log w)$ time. Further, we describe the behaviour of $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$ in this case, establishing the connection between $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)$, $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k+1,w)$, and $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w+1)$. In particular, we show that $\mathcal{DR}_\sigma(k,w)&lt;\frac{2}{w+1}$ (by a tiny margin) unless $w$ is small. We conclude with some partial results and conjectures for the case $w&gt;k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that all totally positive formal power series with integer coefficients and constant term $1$ are precisely the rank-generating functions of Schur-positive upho posets, thereby resolving the main conjecture proposed by Gao, Guo, Seetharaman, and Seidel. To achieve this, we construct a bijection between finitary colored upho posets and atomic, left-cancellative, invertible-free monoids, which restricts to a correspondence between $\mathbb{N}$-graded colored upho posets and left-cancellative homogeneous monoids. Furthermore, we introduce semi-upho posets and develop a convolution operation on colored upho posets with colored semi-upho posets within this monoid-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Root of unity quantum cluster algebras and discriminants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.02314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a connection between the subjects of cluster algebras, polynomial identity algebras and discriminants. For this, we define the notion of root of unity quantum cluster algebras and prove that they are polynomial identity algebras. Inside each such algebra we construct a (large) canonical central subalgebra, which can be viewed as a far reaching generalization of the central subalgebras of big quantum groups constructed by De Concini, Kac and Procesi and used in representation theory. Each such central subalgebra is proved to be isomorphic to the underlying classical cluster algebra of geometric type. When the root of unity quantum cluster algebra is free over its central subalgebra, we prove that the discriminant of the pair is a product of powers of the frozen variables times an integer. An extension of this result is also proved for the discriminants of all subalgebras generated by the cluster variables of nerves in the exchange graph. These results can be used for the effective computation of discriminants. As an application we prove an explicit formula for the discriminant of the integral form over ${\mathbb{Z}}[\varepsilon]$ of each quantum unipotent cells of De Concini, Kac and Procesi for arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, where $\varepsilon$ is a root of unity.</description>

      <title>A Fixed-Parameter Algorithm for the Kneser Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kneser graph $K(n,k)$ is defined for integers $n$ and $k$ with $n \geq 2k$ as the graph whose vertices are all the $k$-subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ where two such sets are adjacent if they are disjoint. A classical result of Lov\'asz asserts that the chromatic number of $K(n,k)$ is $n-2k+2$. In the computational Kneser problem, we are given an oracle access to a coloring of the vertices of $K(n,k)$ with $n-2k+1$ colors, and the goal is to find a monochromatic edge. We present a randomized algorithm for the Kneser problem with running time $n^{O(1)} \cdot k^{O(k)}$. This shows that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter $k$. The analysis involves structural results on intersecting families and on induced subgraphs of Kneser graphs.
  We also study the Agreeable-Set problem of assigning a small subset of a set of $m$ items to a group of $\ell$ agents, so that all agents value the subset at least as much as its complement. As an application of our algorithm for the Kneser problem, we obtain a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for the Agreeable-Set problem for instances that satisfy $\ell \geq m - O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$. We further show that the Agreeable-Set problem is at least as hard as a variant of the Kneser problem with an extended access to the input coloring.</description>

Abstract: We study the Karp--Sipser core of a random graph made of a configuration model with vertices of degree $1,2$ and $3$. This core is obtained by recursively removing the leaves as well as their unique neighbors in the graph. We settle a conjecture of Bauer &amp; Golinelli and prove that at criticality, the Karp--Sipser core has size $ \approx \mathrm{Cst} \cdot \vartheta^{-2} \cdot n^{3/5}$ where $\vartheta$ is the hitting time of the curve $t \mapsto \frac{1}{t^{2}}$ by a linear Brownian motion started at $0$. Our proof relies on a detailed multi-scale analysis of the Markov chain associated to Karp-Sipser leaf-removal algorithm close to its extinction time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes universal formulas describing the global asymptotics of two distinct discrete versions of $\beta$-ensembles in the high, low and fixed temperature regimes. Our results affirmatively answer a question posed by the second author and \'Sniady.
  We first introduce a special class of Jack measures on Young diagrams of arbitrary size, called the ``Jack--Thoma measures'', and prove the LLN and CLT in the three aforementioned limit regimes. In each case, we provide explicit formulas for polynomial observables of the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations around the limit shape. These formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed as sums of weighted lattice paths. Second, we show that the previous formulas are universal: they also describe the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations for the model of random Young diagrams of a fixed size derived from Jack characters with the approximate factorization property. Finally, in stark contrast with continuous $\beta$-ensembles, we show that the limit shapes at high and low temperatures of our random Young diagrams are one-sided infinite staircase shapes. For the Jack--Plancherel measure, we describe this shape explicitly by relating its local minima with the zeroes of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>Poset modules of the $0$-Hecke algebras and related quasisymmetric power sum expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Duchamp--Hivert--Thibon introduced the construction of a right $H_n(0)$-module, denoted as $M_P$, for any partial order $P$ on the set $[n]$. This module is defined by specifying a suitable action of $H_n(0)$ on the set of linear extensions of $P$. In this paper, we refer to this module as the poset module associated with $P$. Firstly, we show that $\bigoplus_{n \ge 0} G_0(\mathscr{P}(n))$ has a Hopf algebra structure that is isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions, where $\mathscr{P}(n)$ is the full subcategory of $\textbf{mod-}H_n(0)$ whose objects are direct sums of finitely many isomorphic copies of poset modules and $G_0(\mathscr{P}(n))$ is the Grothendieck group of $\mathscr{P}(n)$. We also demonstrate how (anti-)automorphism twists interact with these modules, the induction product and restrictions. Secondly, we investigate the (type 1) quasisymmetric power sum expansion of some quasi-analogues $Y_\alpha$ of Schur functions, where $\alpha$ is a composition. We show that they can be expressed as the sum of the $P$-partition generating functions of specific posets, which allows us to utilize the result established by Liu--Weselcouch. Additionally, we provide a new algorithm for obtaining these posets. Using these findings, for the dual immaculate function and the extended Schur function, we express the coefficients appearing in the quasisymmetric power sum expansions in terms of border strip tableaux.</description>

      <title>Small Even Covers, Locally Decodable Codes and Restricted Subgraphs of Edge-Colored Kikuchi Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ on $n$ vertices, an even cover in $H$ is a collection of hyperedges that touch each vertex an even number of times. Even covers are a generalization of cycles in graphs and are equivalent to linearly dependent subsets of a system of linear equations modulo $2$. As a result, they arise naturally in the context of well-studied questions in coding theory and refuting unsatisfiable $k$-SAT formulas. Analogous to the irregular Moore bound of Alon, Hoory, and Linial (2002), in 2008, Feige conjectured an extremal trade-off between the number of hyperedges and the length of the smallest even cover in a $k$-uniform hypergraph. This conjecture was recently settled up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor in the number of hyperedges (Guruswami, Kothari, and Manohar 2022 and Hsieh, Kothari, and Mohanty 2023). These works introduce the new technique that relates hypergraph even covers to cycles in the associated Kikuchi graphs. Their analysis of these Kikuchi graphs, especially for odd $k$, is rather involved and relies on matrix concentration inequalities.
  In this work, we give a simple and purely combinatorial argument that recovers the best-known bound for Feige's conjecture for even $k$. We also introduce a novel variant of a Kikuchi graph which together with this argument improves the logarithmic factor in the best-known bounds for odd $k$. As an application of our ideas, we also give a purely combinatorial proof of the improved lower bounds (Alrabiah, Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar, 2023) on 3-query binary linear locally decodable codes.</description>

      <title>Fine multidegrees, universal Grobner bases, and matrix Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a criterion for a collection of polynomials to be a universal Gr\"{o}bner basis for an ideal in terms of the multidegree of the closure of the corresponding affine variety in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^N$. This criterion can be used to give simple proofs of several existing results on universal Gr\"{o}bner bases. We introduce fine Schubert polynomials, which record the multidegrees of the closures of matrix Schubert varieties in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^{n^2}$. We compute the fine Schubert polynomials of permutations $w$ where the coefficients of the Schubert polynomials of $w$ and $w^{-1}$ are all either 0 or 1, and we use this to give a universal Gr\"{o}bner basis for the ideal of the matrix Schubert variety of such a permutation.</description>

      <title>Comments on "$\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ algorithms for the recognition and isomorphism problems on circular-arc graphs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the work [$\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ algorithms for the recognition and isomorphism problems on circular-arc graphs, SIAM J. Comput. 24(3), 411--439, (1995)], Wen-Lian Hsu claims three results concerning the class of circular-arc graphs: - the design of so-called \emph{decomposition trees} that represent the structure of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs, - an $\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ recognition algorithm for circular-arc graphs, - an $\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ isomorphism algorithm for circular-arc graphs. In [Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013] Curtis, Lin, McConnell, Nussbaum, Soulignac, Spinrad, and Szwarcfiter showed that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is incorrect. In this note, we show that the other two results -- namely, the construction of decomposition trees and the recognition algorithm -- are also flawed.</description>
