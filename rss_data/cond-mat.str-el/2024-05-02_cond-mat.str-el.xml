      <title>Non-perturbative signatures of fractons in the twisted multi-flavor Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge-field configurations with non-trivial topology have profound consequences for the physics of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Over time, arguments have been gathering for the existence of gauge-field configurations with fractional topological charge, called fractons. Ground-state properties of gauge theories can drastically change in presence of fractons in the path integral. However, understanding the origin of such fractons is usually restricted to semi-classical argumentation. Here, we show that fractons persist in strongly correlated many-body systems, using the multiflavor Schwinger model of quantum electrodynamics as a paradigm example. Through detailed numerical tensor-network analysis, we find strong fracton signatures even in highly discretized lattice models, at sizes that are implementable on already existing quantum-simulation devices. Our work sheds light on how the non-trivial topology of gauge theories persists in challenging non-perturbative regimes, and it shows a path forward to probing it in table-top experiments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Nambu-Goldstone modes in many-body scar models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the quasisymmetry-group perspective [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120604 (2021)], we show the universal existence of collective, coherent modes of excitations with small momenta in many-body scar models in the degenerate limit, where the energy spacing in the scar tower vanishes. The number of these modes, as well as the quantum numbers carried by them, are given, not by the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, but by the quasisymmetry of the scar tower: hence the name quasi-Goldstone modes. Based on this, we draw a concrete analogy between the paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the many-body scar physics in the degenerate limit.</description>

      <title>Anomalous phonon Gr\"uneisen parameters in semiconductor Ta$_2$NiS$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain tuning is a powerful experimental method in probing correlated electron systems. Here we study the strain response of the lattice dynamics and electronic structure in semiconductor Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ by polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy. We observe an increase of the size of the direct semiconducting band gap. Although the majority of the optical phonons show only marginal dependence to applied strain, the frequency of the two B$_{2g}$ phonon modes, which have quadrupolar symmetry and already anomalously soften on cooling under zero strain, increases significantly with tensile strain along the $a$ axis. The corresponding Gr\"uneisen parameters are unusually large in magnitude and negative in sign. These effects are well captured by first-principles density functional theory calculations and indicate close proximity of Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ to a structural instability, similar to that encountered in excitonic insulator candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$.</description>

      <title>Single-layer tensor network approach for three-dimensional quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculation of observables with three-dimensional projected entangled pair states is generally hard, as it requires a contraction of complex multi-layer tensor networks. We utilize the multi-layer structure of these tensor networks to largely simplify the contraction. The proposed approach involves the usage of the layer structure both to simplify the search for the boundary projected entangled pair states and the single-layer mapping of the final corner transfer matrix renormalization group contraction. We benchmark our results on the cubic lattice Heisenberg model, reaching the bond dimension D = 7, and find a good agreement with the previous results.</description>

      <title>Oxygen vacancies modulated VO2 for neurons and Spiking Neural Network construction</title>

Abstract: Artificial neuronal devices are the basic building blocks for neuromorphic computing systems, which have been motivated by realistic brain emulation. Aiming for these applications, various device concepts have been proposed to mimic the neuronal dynamics and functions. While till now, the artificial neuron devices with high efficiency, high stability and low power consumption are still far from practical application. Due to the special insulator-metal phase transition, Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) has been considered as an idea candidate for neuronal device fabrication. However, its intrinsic insulating state requires the VO2 neuronal device to be driven under large bias voltage, resulting in high power consumption and low frequency. Thus in the current study, we have addressed this challenge by preparing oxygen vacancies modulated VO2 film(VO2-x) and fabricating the VO2-x neuronal devices for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) construction. Results indicate the neuron devices can be operated under lower voltage with improved processing speed. The proposed VO2-x based back-propagation SNNs (BP-SNNs) system, trained with the MNIST dataset, demonstrates excellent accuracy in image recognition. Our study not only demonstrates the VO2-x based neurons and SNN system for practical application, but also offers an effective way to optimize the future neuromorphic computing systems by defect engineering strategy.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization slowing down of a quantum many-body system upon approach to two distinct integrability limits. Motivated by previous studies of classical systems, we identify two thermalization time scales: one quantum Lyapunov time scale is extracted by quantifying operator growth in time in an appropriately defined basis, while another ergodization time scale is related to statistics of fluctuations of the time-evolved operator around its mean value based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using a paradigmatic Quantum Ising chain we find that both timescales diverge upon approach to integrability. The relative strength of the divergence of the scales depends on the particular integrable limit. This allows us to define two different universality classes of quantum thermalization: short- and long-range networks.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform and anisotropic electric polarizability resulting in pronounced local repulsion minima in high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the dramatic effect of non-uniform, discrete electric polarizability in high-T$_{C}$ superconductors on the spatial fluctuations of the short to medium range Coulomb interactions through a real-space semiclassical model. Although this is a general property, we concentrate on the cuprates as parent compounds, in which the charge carriers are primarily concentrated on the O sublattice. The anisotropic effective Cu-O bond polarization caused by charge transfer energy modulation and the O$^{2-}$ atomic polarizability together generate a non-monotonic screened hole-hole Coulomb interaction at short distances that displays a local minimum at the in-plane second nearest neighbor O-O distance solely along the Cu-O bond direction. This is in accordance with the pseudogap phase anisotropy and the short coherence length observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field expulsion in optically driven YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent optical driving in quantum solids is emerging as a new research frontier, with many demonstrations of exotic non-equilibrium quantum phases. These are based on engineered band structures, and on stimulated nonlinear interactions between driven modes. Enhanced functionalities like ferroelectricity, magnetism and superconductivity have been reported in these non-equilibrium settings. In high-Tc cuprates, coherent driving of certain phonon modes induces a transient state with superconducting-like optical properties, observed far above T$_c$ and throughout the pseudogap phase. Questions remain not only on the microscopic nature of this phenomenon, but also on the macroscopic properties of these transient states, beyond the documented optical conductivities. Crucially, it is not clear if driven cuprates exhibit Meissner-like diamagnetism. Here, the time-dependent magnetic-field amplitude surrounding a driven YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$ sample is probed by measuring Faraday rotation in a GaP layer adjacent to the superconductor. For the same driving conditions that result in superconducting-like optical properties, an enhancement of magnetic field at the edge of the sample is detected, indicative of induced diamagnetism. The dynamical field expulsion measured after pumping is comparable in size to the one expected in an equilibrium type II superconductor of similar shape and size with a volume susceptibility $\chi_v$ of order -0.3. Crucially, this value is incompatible with a photo-induced increase in mobility without superconductivity. Rather, it underscores the notion of a pseudogap phase in which incipient superconducting correlations are enhanced or synchronized by the optical drive.</description>

      <title>Hundness and band renormalization in the kagome antiferromagnets Mn$_3X$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topological band structures and electronic correlations may lead to novel exotic quantum phenomena with potential applications. First-principles calculations are critical for guiding the experimental discoveries and interpretations, but often fail if electronic correlations cannot be properly treated. Here we show that this issue occurs also in the antiferromagnetic kagome lattice Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge), which exhibit a large anomalous Hall effect due to topological band structures with Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our systematic investigations reveal a crucial role of the Hund's rule coupling on three key aspects of their magnetic, electronic, and topological properties: (1) the establishment of noncollinear antiferromagnetic orders, (2) the weakly renormalized bands in excellent agreement with ARPES, and (3) a sensitive tuning of the Weyl nodes beyond previous expectations. Our work provides a basis for understanding the topological properties of Mn$_3X$ and challenges previous experimental interpretations based on incorrect band structures.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation from electrons moving on topological spin textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a striking phenomenon, which reflects the ultrafast dynamics of electrons. Recently, it has been demonstrated that HHG can be used to reconstruct not only the energy band structure but also the geometric structure characterized by the Berry curvature. Here, we numerically investigate HHG arising from electrons coupled with a topological spin texture in a spin scalar chiral state where time reversal symmetry is broken. In this system, a sign change in scalar chirality alters the sign of the Berry curvature while keeping the energy band structure unchanged, allowing us to discuss purely geometrical effects on HHG. Notably, we found that, when the optical frequency is significantly lower than the energy gap, the sign of scalar chirality largely affects the longitudinal response parallel to the optical field rather than the transverse response. Our analysis suggests that this can be attributed to interband currents induced by the recombination of electron-hole pairs whose real-space trajectories are modulated by the anomalous velocity term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent magnetic phenomena at interfaces represent a frontier in materials science, pivotal for advancing technologies in spintronics and magnetic storage. In this letter, we utilize a suite of advanced X-ray spectroscopic and scattering techniques to investigate emergent interfacial ferromagnetism in oxide superlattices comprised of antiferromagnetic CaMnO3 and paramagnetic CaRuO3. Our findings challenge prior theoretical models by demonstrating that the ferromagnetism extends beyond the interfacial layer into multiple unit cells of CaMnO3 and exhibits an asymmetric profile. Complementary density functional calculations reveal that the interfacial ferromagnetism is driven by the double exchange mechanism, facilitated by charge transfer from Ru to Mn ions. Additionally, defect chemistry, particularly the presence of oxygen vacancies, likely plays a crucial role in modifying the magnetic moments at the interface, leading to the observed asymmetry between the top and bottom CaMnO3 interfacial magnetic layers. Our findings underscore the potential of manipulating interfacial ferromagnetism through point defect engineering.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the intricate relationship between Fermi surface (FS) and electron transport in materials is crucial for advancing our knowledge of condensed matter physics. Commonly, FS properties are used to predict current within the framework of Fermi-liquid theory, where locally on the FS electron behavior can be estimated by nearly free election gas with slowly switched-on interactions. In this study, we go beyond the limits of this theory and explore how the geometry of the FS can result in strongly correlated Fermi-liquid or non-Fermi liquid electron behavior in metals and semi-metals and consequent anomalous transport effects: firstly, we establish that a semi-metallic FS with non-zero genus signals Fermi liquid breakdown, expanding our understanding of FS topology (Lemma 1). Secondly, we explicitly give dispersion relation in the form of a general polynomial of degree $2n, n \ge 2$, which generates $n$ hole in the Fermi surface (Lemma 2). Additionally, we propose that hyperbolicity of the spinless FS leads to spin-correlated transport, offering insights into the implementation of the spin degree of freedom into the complexification of the reciprocal space(Proposition 1). These results deepen our understanding of FS geometry's impact on electronic behaviors, providing a theoretical foundation for the further development of a novel geometrized theoretical formalism of anomalous quantum transport within a semiclassical approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems with conserved dipole moment have drawn considerable interest in light of their realization in recent experiments on tilted optical lattices. An important question for such systems is delineating the conditions under which they admit a unique gapped ground state that is consistent with all symmetries. Here, we study one-dimensional translation-invariant lattices that conserve U(1) charge and $\mathbb{Z}_L$ dipole moment, where discreteness of the dipole symmetry is enforced by periodic boundary conditions, with $L$ the system size. We show that in these systems, a symmetric, gapped, and non-degenerate ground state requires not only integer charge filling, but also a fixed value of the dipole filling, while other fractional dipole fillings enforce either a gapless or symmetry-breaking ground state. In contrast with prior results in the literature, we find that the dipole filling constraint depends both on the charge filling as well as the system size, emphasizing the subtle interplay of dipole symmetry with boundary conditions. We support our results with numerical simulations and exact results.</description>

      <title>Linear combinations of cluster mean-field states applied to spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an innovative cluster-based method employing linear combinations of diverse cluster mean-field (cMF) states, and apply it to describe the ground state of strongly-correlated spin systems. In cluster mean-field theory, the ground state wavefunction is expressed as a factorized tensor product of optimized cluster states. While our prior work concentrated on a single cMF tiling, this study removes that constraint by combining different tilings of cMF states. Selection criteria, including translational symmetry and spatial proximity, guide this process. We present benchmark calculations for the one- and two-dimensional $J_1-J_2$ and $XXZ$ Heisenberg models. Our findings highlight two key aspects. First, the method offers a semi-quantitative description of the $0.4 \lessapprox J_2/J_1 \lessapprox 0.6$ regime of the $J_1-J_2$ model - a particularly challenging regime for existing methods. Second, our results demonstrate the capability of our method to provide qualitative descriptions for all the models and regimes considered, establishing it as a valuable reference. However, the inclusion of additional (weak) correlations is necessary for quantitative agreement, and we explore methods to incorporate these extra correlations.</description>

      <title>Excitation Spectrum and Spin Hamiltonian of the Frustrated Quantum Ising Magnet Pr$_3$BWO$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a thorough experimental investigation on single crystals of the rare-earth based frustrated quantum antiferromagnet Pr$_3$BWO$_9$, a purported spin-liquid candidate on the breathing kagome lattice. This material possesses a disordered ground state with an unusual excitation spectrum involving a coexistence of sharp spin-waves and broad continuum excitations. Nevertheless, we show through a combination of thermodynamic, magnetometric and spectroscopic probes with detailed theoretical modeling that it should be understood in a completely different framework. The crystal field splits the lowest quasi-doublet states into two singlets moderately coupled through frustrated superexchange, resulting in a simple effective Hamiltonian of an Ising model in a transverse magnetic field. While our neutron spectroscopy data do point to significant correlations within the kagome planes, the dominant interactions are out-of-plane, forming frustrated triangular spin-tubes through two competing ferro-antiferromagnetic bonds. The resulting ground state is a simple quantum paramagnet, but with significant modifications to both thermodynamic and dynamic properties due to small perturbations to the transverse field Ising model in the form of hyperfine enhanced nuclear moments and weak structural disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate classes of interacting quantum spin systems in a single-mode cavity with a Dicke coupling, as a paradigmatic example of strongly correlated light-matter systems. Coming from the limit of weak light-matter couplings and large number of matter entities, we map the relevant low-energy sector of a broad class of models in the non-superradiant phases onto the exactly solvable Dicke model. We apply the outcomes to the Dicke-Ising model as a paradigmatic example, in agreement with results obtained by mean-field theory. We further accompany and verify our findings with finite-size calculations, using exact diagonalization and the series expansion method pcst++.</description>

      <title>Rapidly convergent quantum Monte Carlo using a Chebyshev projector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-reference coupled-cluster Monte Carlo (MR-CCMC) algorithm is a determinant-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm that is conceptually similar to Full Configuration Interaction QMC (FCIQMC). It has been shown to offer a balanced treatment of both static and dynamic correlation while retaining polynomial scaling, although application to large systems with significant strong correlation remained impractical. In this paper, we document recent algorithmic advances that enable rapid convergence and a more black-box approach to the multi-reference problem. These include a logarithmically scaling metric-tree based excitation acceptance algorithm to search for determinants connected to the reference space at the desired excitation level and a symmetry-screening procedure for the reference space. We show that, for moderately sized reference spaces, the new search algorithm brings about an approximately 8-fold acceleration of one MR-CCMC iteration, while the symmetry screening procedure reduces the number of active reference space determinants at essentially no loss of accuracy. We also introduce a stochastic implementation of an approximate wall projector, which is the infinite imaginary time limit of the exponential projector, using a truncated expansion of the wall function in Chebyshev polynomials. Notably, this wall-Chebyshev projector can be used to accelerate any projector-based QMC algorithm. We show that it requires significantly fewer applications of the Hamiltonian to achieve the same statistical convergence. We benchmark these acceleration methods on the beryllium and carbon dimers, using initiator FCIQMC and MR-CCMC with basis sets up to cc-pVQZ quality.</description>

      <title>Discovery of universal phonon thermal Hall effect in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal Hall effect (THE) in insulator is a remarkable phenomenon that arises from the motion of chargeless quasi-particles under a magnetic field. While magnons or exotic spin excitations were considered as the origin of THE in some magnetic materials, there are more and more evidences suggesting that phonons play a significant role. However, the mechanism behind phonon THE is still unknown. Here we report the observation of THE, including planar THE, in a broad range of non-magnetic insulators and semiconductors: SrTiO3, SiO2 (quartz), MgO, MgAl2O4, Si and Ge. While the presence of antiferrodistortive domains in SrTiO3 and chiral phonons in SiO2 may complicate the interpretation of THE, the striking observations of THE in trivial insulators MgO and MgAl2O4, as well as in high-purity intrinsic semiconductors Si and Ge, demonstrate that phonon THE is a universal property of crystals. Without other effects on phonons such as from magnons, this universal phonon THE is characterized by a scaling law of |\k{appa}_xy| ~ \k{appa}_xx^2. Our results experimentally discover a fundamental physics of phonons in magnetic field, which should come from the direct coupling between atom vibrations and the field. Starting from this universal phonon THE in crystals, all previous interpretations of THE in magnetic or non-magnetic materials need to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

      <title>Universality and the thermoelectric transport properties of a double quantum dot system: Seeking for conditions that improve the thermoelectric efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing universal relations for the Onsager coefficients in the linear regime at the symmetric point of the single impurity Anderson model, we calculate the conditions under which the quantum scattering phase shift should satisfy to produce the asymptotic Carnot's limit for the thermoelectric efficiency. We show that a single quantum dot connected by metallic leads at the Kondo regime cannot achieve the conditions that cause the best thermoelectric efficiency. We study a system of serial double quantum dots without inter-dot correlations. We show that maintaining one dot in the electron-hole symmetric point makes it possible to obtain conditions for the quantum phase shift linked to charge fluctuations in the other quantum dot that satisfy the conditions associated with enhancing the thermoelectric efficiency. We also discuss the presence of bound states in the continuum (BICs) and quasi-BICs associated with the quantum scattering interference process that improves thermoelectric efficiency. We identify two types of quasi-BICs that occur at low and high temperatures: The first is associated with single Fano resonances, and the last is with several Fano processes. We also discussed possible temperature values and conditions that could be linked with the experimental realization of our results.</description>

      <title>Quantized thermal and spin transports of dirty planar topological superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nontrivial bulk topological invariants of quantum materials can leave their signatures on charge, thermal and spin transports. In two dimensions, their imprints can be experimentally measured from well-developed multiterminal Hall bar arrangements. Here, we numerically compute the low temperature ($T$) thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$) and zero temperature spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall conductivities, and longitudinal thermal conductance ($G^{th}_{xx}$) of various prominent two-dimensional fully gapped topological superconductors, belonging to distinct Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, namely $p+ip$ (class D), $d+id$ (class C) and $p \pm ip$ (class DIII) paired states, in mesoscopic six-terminal Hall bar setups from the scattering matrix formalism using Kwant. In both clean and weak disorder limits, the time-reversal symmetry breaking $p+ip$ and $d+id$ pairings show half-quantized and quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ [in units of $\kappa_0=\pi^2 k^2_B T/(3h)$], respectively, while the latter one in addition accommodates a quantized $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ [in units of $\sigma^{sp}_0=\hbar/(8 \pi)$]. By contrast, the time-reversal invariant $p \pm ip$ pairing only displays a quantized $G^{th}_{xx}$ at low $T$ up to a moderate strength of disorder. In the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses ($\kappa_{xy}$, $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$, and $G^{th}_{xx}$) vanish. Possible material platforms hosting such paired states and manifesting these robust topological thermal and spin responses are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a doped holographic superconductor in the Gubser-Rocha model, and realize a superconducting dome in the middle of the temperature-doping phase diagram. It is worth noting that unlike the previous researches, the profile of our dome shrinks inward near zero temperature. From the numerical observation for the coupling dependence of the phase diagram, we find that the coupling between the two gauge fields plays a crucial role in the formation of dome. We also analytically calculate the DC conductivity of the normal phase of the system in the momentum dissipation and obtain the resistivity which is proportional to temperature. The AC conductivity is calculated numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Anderson localization in disordered tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices. Such lattices are geometries intermediate between ordinary two-dimensional crystalline lattices, which localize at infinitesimal disorder, and Bethe lattices, which localize at strong disorder. Using state-of-the-art computational group theory methods to create large systems, we approximate the thermodynamic limit through appropriate periodic boundary conditions and numerically demonstrate the existence of an Anderson localization transition on the $\{8,3\}$ and $\{8,8\}$ lattices. We find unusually large critical disorder strengths, determine critical exponents, and observe a strong finite-size effect in the level statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the pairing state and gap structure of UTe$_2$ using a six-orbital model which we call the $f$-$d$-$p$ model. Our model accurately reproduces the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces consistent with recent de Haas-van Alphen oscillation measurements and the $(0, \pm \pi, 0)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed by neutron scattering. We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$. The most likely state is found to be an $s$-wave state with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure that exhibits a point-node-like behavior of the specific heat at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Universal low-temperature fluctuation of unconventional superconductors revealed: 'Smoking gun' leaves proper bosonic superfluidity the last theory standing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-temperature thermal fluctuations offer an essential window in characterizing the true nature of a quantum state of matter, a quintessential example being Fermi liquid theory. Here, we examine the leading thermal fluctuation of the superfluid density across numerous families ranging from relatively conventional to highly unconventional superconductors (MgB$_2$, bismuthates, doped buckyballs, heavy fermions, UTe$_2$, doped SrTiO$_3$, Chevrel clusters, intermetallics, organic superconductors, transition metal dichalcogenides, ruthenates, iron-pnictides, cuprates, and kagome metals). Amazingly, in all of them an unprecedented universal $T^3$ depletion materializes in the low-temperature superfluid density, even in the believed-to-be-conventional MgB$_2$. This reveals a new quantum superfluid state of matter and requires a necessary change of paradigm in describing modern superconductors. We demonstrate that such unorthodox yet generic behavior can be described by a proper particle-conserving theory of bosonic superfluidity hosting a long-lived `true condensate'.</description>

      <title>A general framework for active space embedding methods: applications in quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed a general framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing of molecular and periodic embedding approaches based on an orbital space separation of the fragment and environment degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion algorithm are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. Application of this scheme to study localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties of the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in the position of the main absorption band, the method demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the excellent agreement with the experimental photoluminescence emission peak.</description>
