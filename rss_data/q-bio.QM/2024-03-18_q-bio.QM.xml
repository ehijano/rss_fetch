      <title>Large Language Model-informed ECG Dual Attention Network for Heart Failure Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant public health challenge due to its rising global mortality rate. Addressing this issue through early diagnosis and prevention could significantly reduce the disease's impact. This work introduces a methodology for HF risk prediction using clinically acquired 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). We present a novel, lightweight dual-attention ECG network designed to capture complex ECG features essential for early HF prediction, despite the notable imbalance between low and high-risk groups. The network features a cross-lead attention module and twelve lead-specific temporal attention modules to capture cross-lead interactions and local temporal dynamics within each lead. To prevent model overfitting from limited training data, we leverage a large language model (LLM) with a public ECG-Report dataset for pretraining on an ECG-report alignment task. The network is then fine-tuned for HF risk prediction using two specific cohorts from the UK Biobank study, focusing on patients with hypertension (UKB-HYP) and those who have had a myocardial infarction (UKB-MI). Our findings show that LLM-informed pretraining significantly improves the network's HF risk prediction capability in these cohorts. Moreover, the dual-attention mechanism enhances interpretability and predictive performance, ensuring a transparent and reliable prediction process. The method outperforms existing models, achieving average C-index scores of 0.6349 and 0.5805 on the UKB-HYP and UKB-MI test sets, respectively. This performance demonstrates our approach's effectiveness in managing complex clinical ECG data and its potential to improve HF risk assessment across various populations.</description>

      <title>Inference of Monosynaptic Connections from Parallel Spike Trains: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a mini-review about the progress in inferring monosynaptic connections from spike trains of multiple neurons over the past twenty years. First, we explain a variety of meanings of ``neuronal connectivity'' in different research areas of neuroscience, such as structural connectivity, monosynaptic connectivity, and functional connectivity. Among these, we focus on the methods used to infer the monosynaptic connectivity from spike data. We then summarize the inference methods based on two main approaches, i.e., correlation-based and model-based approaches. Finally, we describe available source codes for connectivity inference and future challenges. Although inference will never be perfect, the accuracy of identifying the monosynaptic connections has improved dramatically in recent years due to continuous efforts.</description>

      <title>Trajectory inference for a branching SDE model of cell differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A core challenge for modern biology is how to infer the trajectories of individual cells from population-level time courses of high-dimensional gene expression data. Birth and death of cells present a particular difficulty: existing trajectory inference methods cannot distinguish variability in net proliferation from cell differentiation dynamics, and hence require accurate prior knowledge of the proliferation rate. Building on Global Waddington-OT (gWOT), which performs trajectory inference with rigorous theoretical guarantees when birth and death can be neglected, we show how to use lineage trees available with recently developed CRISPR-based measurement technologies to disentangle proliferation and differentiation. In particular, when there is neither death nor subsampling of cells, we show that we extend gWOT to the case with proliferation with similar theoretical guarantees and computational cost, without requiring any prior information. In the case of death and/or subsampling, our method introduces a bias, that we describe explicitly and argue to be inherent to these lineage tracing data. We demonstrate in both cases the ability of this method to reliably reconstruct the landscape of a branching SDE from time-courses of simulated datasets with lineage tracing, outperforming even a benchmark using the experimentally unavailable true branching rates.</description>

      <title>Interpretable statistical representations of neural population dynamics and geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of neuron populations during many behavioural tasks evolve on low-dimensional manifolds. However, it remains challenging to discover latent representations from neural recordings that are interpretable and consistently decodable across individuals and conditions without explicitly relying on behavioural information. Here, we introduce MARBLE, a fully unsupervised geometric deep learning framework for the data-driven representation of non-linear dynamics based on statistical distributions of local dynamical features. Using both in silico examples from non-linear dynamical systems and recurrent neural networks and in vivo recordings from primates and rodents, we demonstrate that MARBLE can infer latent representations that are highly interpretable in terms of global system variables such as decision-thresholds, kinematics or internal states. We also show that MARBLE representations are consistent across neural networks and animals so that they can be used to compare cognitive computations or train universal decoders. Through extensive benchmarking, we show that unsupervised MARBLE provides best-in-class within- and across-animal decoding accuracy, comparable to or significantly better than current supervised approaches, yet without the need for behavioural labels. Our results suggest that using the manifold structure in conjunction with the temporal information of neural dynamics provides a common framework to develop better decoding algorithms and assimilate data across experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the biomimicry gap in biohybrid robot-fish pairs</title>

Abstract: Biohybrid systems in which robotic lures interact with animals have become compelling tools for probing and identifying the mechanisms underlying collective animal behavior. One key challenge lies in the transfer of social interaction models from simulations to reality, using robotics to validate the modeling hypotheses. This challenge arises in bridging what we term the "biomimicry gap", which is caused by imperfect robotic replicas, communication cues and physics constraints not incorporated in the simulations, that may elicit unrealistic behavioral responses in animals. In this work, we used a biomimetic lure of a rummy-nose tetra fish (Hemigrammus rhodostomus) and a neural network (NN) model for generating biomimetic social interactions. Through experiments with a biohybrid pair comprising a fish and the robotic lure, a pair of real fish, and simulations of pairs of fish, we demonstrate that our biohybrid system generates social interactions mirroring those of genuine fish pairs. Our analyses highlight that: 1) the lure and NN maintain minimal deviation in real-world interactions compared to simulations and fish-only experiments, 2) our NN controls the robot efficiently in real-time, and 3) a comprehensive validation is crucial to bridge the biomimicry gap, ensuring realistic biohybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Sweetwater: An interpretable and adaptive autoencoder for efficient tissue deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) stands as a powerful tool for deciphering cellular heterogeneity and exploring gene expression profiles at high resolution. However, its high cost renders it impractical for extensive sample cohorts within routine clinical care, hindering its broader applicability. Hence, many methodologies have recently arised to estimate cell type proportions from bulk RNA-seq samples (known as deconvolution methods). However, they have several limitations: Many depend on selecting a robust scRNA-seq reference dataset, which is often challenging. Secondly, building reliable pseudobulk samples requires determining the optimal number of genes or cells involved in the simulated data generation process, which has not been studied in depth. Moreover, pseudobulk and bulk RNA-seq samples often exhibit distribution shifts. Finally, most modern deconvolution approaches behave as a black box, and the underlying mechanisms of the deconvolution task are still unknown, which can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we present Sweetwater, an adaptive and interpretable autoencoder able to efficiently deconvolve bulk RNA-seq and microarray samples leveraging multiple classes of reference data, such as scRNA-seq and single-nuclei RNA-seq. Moreover, it can be trained on a mixture of FACS-sorted FASTQ files, which we newly propose to use as this reduces platform-specific biases and may potentially outperform single-cell-based references. Also, we demonstrate that Sweetwater effectively uncovers biologically meaningful patterns during the training process, increasing the reliability of the results. Sweetwater is available at https://github.com/ubioinformat/Sweetwater, and we anticipate will facilitate and expedite the accurate examination of high-throughput clinical data across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Molecular Identification and Peak Assignment: Leveraging Multi-Level Multimodal Alignment on NMR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays an essential role in deciphering molecular structure and dynamic behaviors. While AI-enhanced NMR prediction models hold promise, challenges still persist in tasks such as molecular retrieval, isomer recognition, and peak assignment. In response, this paper introduces a novel solution, Multi-Level Multimodal Alignment with Knowledge-Guided Instance-Wise Discrimination (K-M3AID), which establishes correspondences between two heterogeneous modalities: molecular graphs and NMR spectra. K-M3AID employs a dual-coordinated contrastive learning architecture with three key modules: a graph-level alignment module, a node-level alignment module, and a communication channel. Notably, K-M3AID introduces knowledge-guided instance-wise discrimination into contrastive learning within the node-level alignment module. In addition, K-M3AID demonstrates that skills acquired during node-level alignment have a positive impact on graph-level alignment, acknowledging meta-learning as an inherent property. Empirical validation underscores K-M3AID's effectiveness in multiple zero-shot tasks.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Augmentations for Robust OOD Self-Supervised Contrastive Phonocardiogram Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent increase in research activity, deep-learning models have not yet been widely accepted in several real-world settings, such as medicine. The shortage of high-quality annotated data often hinders the development of robust and generalizable models, which do not suffer from degraded effectiveness when presented with newly-collected, out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a potential solution to labeled data scarcity, as it takes advantage of unlabeled data to increase model effectiveness and robustness. In this research, we propose applying contrastive SSL for detecting abnormalities in 1D phonocardiogram (PCG) samples by learning a generalized representation of the signal. Specifically, we perform an extensive comparative evaluation of a wide range of audio-based augmentations, evaluate trained classifiers on multiple datasets across different downstream tasks, and finally report on the impact of each augmentation in model training. We experimentally demonstrate that, depending on its training distribution, the effectiveness of a fully-supervised model can degrade up to 32% when evaluated on unseen data, while SSL models only lose up to 10% or even improve in some cases. We argue and experimentally demonstrate that, contrastive SSL pretraining can assist in providing robust classifiers which can generalize to unseen, OOD data, without relying on time- and labor-intensive annotation processes by medical experts. Furthermore, the proposed extensive evaluation protocol sheds light on the most promising and appropriate augmentations for robust PCG signal processing, by calculating their effect size on model training. Finally, we provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap towards producing robust models for PCG classification, in addition to an open-source codebase for developing novel approaches.</description>

      <title>DeepCRE: Transforming Drug R&amp;D via AI-Driven Cross-drug Response Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fields of therapeutic application and drug research and development (R&amp;D) both face substantial challenges, i.e., the therapeutic domain calls for more treatment alternatives, while numerous promising pre-clinical drugs have failed in clinical trials. One of the reasons is the inadequacy of Cross-drug Response Evaluation (CRE) during the late stages of drug R&amp;D. Although in-silico CRE models bring a promising solution, existing methodologies are restricted to early stages of drug R&amp;D, such as target and cell-line levels, offering limited improvement to clinical success rates. Herein, we introduce DeepCRE, a pioneering AI model designed to predict CRE effectively in the late stages of drug R&amp;D. DeepCRE outperforms the existing best models by achieving an average performance improvement of 17.7% in patient-level CRE, and a 5-fold increase in indication-level CRE, facilitating more accurate personalized treatment predictions and better pharmaceutical value assessment for indications, respectively. Furthermore, DeepCRE has identified a set of six drug candidates that show significantly greater effectiveness than a comparator set of two approved drugs in 5/8 colorectal cancer organoids. This demonstrates the capability of DeepCRE to systematically uncover a spectrum of drug candidates with enhanced therapeutic effects, highlighting its potential to transform drug R&amp;D.</description>
