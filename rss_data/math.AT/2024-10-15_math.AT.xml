      <title>Splitting rational incomplete Mackey functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by equivariant homotopy theory, equivariant algebra studies generalisations of G-Mackey functors that do not have all transfer maps (also known as induction maps), for G a finite group. These incomplete Mackey functors have interesting and subtle properties that are more complicated than classical algebra. The levels of incompleteness that occur are indexed by simple combinatorial data known as transfers systems for G, which are refinements of the subgroup relation satisfying certain axioms. The aim of this paper is to generalise the Greenlees-May and Thevenaz-Webb splitting result of rational G-Mackey functors to the incomplete case.
  By calculating idempotents of the rational incomplete Burnside ring of G, we find maximal splitting of the category of rational incomplete G-Mackey functors. These splittings are determined by maps of the form (H to G) in the transfer system. We give an intrinsic definition of the split pieces beyond the idempotent description in order to understand what is the minimal information needed to determine an arbitrary rational incomplete G-Mackey functor. We end the paper with a series of examples of possible splittings and illustrate how simpler transfer systems have fewer terms in the splitting but the split pieces are more complicated.</description>

      <title>Operators on symmetric polynomials and applications in computing the cohomology of $BPU_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the integral cohomology ring of the classifying space $BPU_n$ of the projective unitary group $PU_n$. By calculating a Serre spectral sequence, we determine the ring stucture of $H^*(BPU_n;\mathbb{Z})$ in dimensions $\leq 11$. For any odd prime $p$, we also determine the $p$-primary subgroups of $H^i(BPU_n;\mathbb{Z})$ in the range $i\leq 2p+13$ for $i$ odd and $i\leq 4p+8$ for $i$ even. The main technique used in the calculation is applying the theory of Young diagrams and Schur polynomials to certain linear operators on symmetric polynomials.</description>

      <title>Algebras for enriched $\infty$-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.10042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the description of enriched $\infty$-operads as associative algebras in symmetric sequences, we define algebras for enriched $\infty$-operads as certain modules in symmetric sequences. For $\mathbf{V}$ a symmetric monoidal model category and $\mathbf{O}$ a $\Sigma$-cofibrant operad in $\mathbf{V}$ for which the model structure on $\mathbf{V}$ can be lifted to one on $\mathbf{O}$-algebras, we then prove that strict algebras in $\mathbf{V}$ are equivalent to $\infty$-categorical algebras in the symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category associated to $\mathbf{V}$. We also show that for an $\infty$-operad $\mathcal{O}$ enriched in a suitable closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$, we can equivalently describe $\mathcal{O}$-algebras in $\mathcal{V}$ as morphisms of $\infty$-operads from $\mathcal{O}$ to a self-enrichment of $\mathcal{V}$.</description>

      <title>Additive Partial Matchings Induced by Persistence Morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.11100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a morphism of persistence modules (a.k.a. persistence morphism) $f\colon V \rightarrow U$, we introduce a novel operator that determines a partial matching between the barcodes of $V$ and $U$ induced by $f$. We show that the proposed operator is additive with respect to the direct sum of persistence morphisms and contains more information than the image persistence module $f V$ and the rank invariant. We also illustrate some advantages of using our induced partial matching over the Bauer-Lesnick partial matching $\chi_f$. Lastly, we provide a family of persistence morphisms that contain modules built from Morse filtrations, for which $\chi_f$, $f V$, the rank invariant and our proposed induced partial matching are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Computing the Dimension of a Bipartition Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05799v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dimension of a bipartition matrix (BPM) is the sum of the dimensions of its indecomposable factors. The dimension of an indecomposable BPM is the sum of its row, column, and entry dimensions. To compute these dimensions, we apply four routines of independent interest: (1) Factor a bipartition as a product of indecomposables; (2) recover a bipartition from its indecomposable factorization; (3) factor a BPM as a product of indecomposables; and (4) compute the ``transpose-rotation'' (the column dimension of a BPM is the row dimension of its transpose-rotation).</description>

      <title>Generalized Simplicial Attention Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph machine learning methods excel at leveraging pairwise relations present in the data. However, graphs are unable to fully capture the multi-way interactions inherent in many complex systems. An effective way to incorporate them is to model the data on higher-order combinatorial topological spaces, such as Simplicial Complexes (SCs) or Cell Complexes. For this reason, we introduce Generalized Simplicial Attention Neural Networks (GSANs), novel neural network architectures designed to process data living on simplicial complexes using masked self-attentional layers. Hinging on topological signal processing principles, we devise a series of principled self-attention mechanisms able to process data associated with simplices of various order, such as nodes, edges, triangles, and beyond. These schemes learn how to combine data associated with neighbor simplices of consecutive order in a task-oriented fashion, leveraging on the simplicial Dirac operator and its Dirac decomposition. We also prove that GSAN satisfies two fundamental properties: permutation equivariance and simplicial-awareness. Finally, we illustrate how our approach compares favorably with other simplicial and graph models when applied to several (inductive and transductive) tasks such as trajectory prediction, missing data imputation, graph classification, and simplex prediction.</description>
