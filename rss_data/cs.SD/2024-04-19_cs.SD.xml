      <title>Large Language Models: From Notes to Musical Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many topics of the learning-based approach to automated music generation are under active research, musical form is under-researched. In particular, recent methods based on deep learning models generate music that, at the largest time scale, lacks any structure. In practice, music longer than one minute generated by such models is either unpleasantly repetitive or directionless. Adapting a recent music generation model, this paper proposes a novel method to generate music with form. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate 2.5-minute-long music that is considered as pleasant as the music used to train the model. The paper first reviews a recent music generation method based on language models (transformer architecture). We discuss why learning musical form by such models is infeasible. Then we discuss our proposed method and the experiments.</description>

      <title>MIDGET: Music Conditioned 3D Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a MusIc conditioned 3D Dance GEneraTion model, named MIDGET based on Dance motion Vector Quantised Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) model and Motion Generative Pre-Training (GPT) model to generate vibrant and highquality dances that match the music rhythm. To tackle challenges in the field, we introduce three new components: 1) a pre-trained memory codebook based on the Motion VQ-VAE model to store different human pose codes, 2) employing Motion GPT model to generate pose codes with music and motion Encoders, 3) a simple framework for music feature extraction. We compare with existing state-of-the-art models and perform ablation experiments on AIST++, the largest publicly available music-dance dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on motion quality and its alignment with the music.</description>

      <title>TIMIT Speaker Profiling: A Comparison of Multi-task learning and Single-task learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs deep learning techniques to explore four speaker profiling tasks on the TIMIT dataset, namely gender classification, accent classification, age estimation, and speaker identification, highlighting the potential and challenges of multi-task learning versus single-task models. The motivation for this research is twofold: firstly, to empirically assess the advantages and drawbacks of multi-task learning over single-task models in the context of speaker profiling; secondly, to emphasize the undiminished significance of skillful feature engineering for speaker recognition tasks. The findings reveal challenges in accent classification, and multi-task learning is found advantageous for tasks of similar complexity. Non-sequential features are favored for speaker recognition, but sequential ones can serve as starting points for complex models. The study underscores the necessity of meticulous experimentation and parameter tuning for deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Suicide Risk Assessment: A Speech-Based Automated Approach in Emergency Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delayed access to specialized psychiatric assessments and care for patients at risk of suicidal tendencies in emergency departments creates a notable gap in timely intervention, hindering the provision of adequate mental health support during critical situations. To address this, we present a non-invasive, speech-based approach for automatic suicide risk assessment. For our study, we have collected a novel dataset of speech recordings from $20$ patients from which we extract three sets of features, including wav2vec, interpretable speech and acoustic features, and deep learning-based spectral representations. We proceed by conducting a binary classification to assess suicide risk in a leave-one-subject-out fashion. Our most effective speech model achieves a balanced accuracy of $66.2\,\%$. Moreover, we show that integrating our speech model with a series of patients' metadata, such as the history of suicide attempts or access to firearms, improves the overall result. The metadata integration yields a balanced accuracy of $94.4\,\%$, marking an absolute improvement of $28.2\,\%$, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approaches for automatic suicide risk assessment in emergency medicine.</description>

      <title>Advancing Speech Translation: A Corpus of Mandarin-English Conversational Telephone Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a set of English translations for a 123-hour subset of the CallHome Mandarin Chinese data and the HKUST Mandarin Telephone Speech data for the task of speech translation. Paired source-language speech and target-language text is essential for training end-to-end speech translation systems and can provide substantial performance improvements for cascaded systems as well, relative to training on more widely available text data sets. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a general-purpose translation model to our Mandarin-English conversational telephone speech training set improves target-domain BLEU by more than 8 points, highlighting the importance of matched training data.</description>

      <title>HyDiscGAN: A Hybrid Distributed cGAN for Audio-Visual Privacy Preservation in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify speakers' sentiment tendencies in multimodal video content, raising serious concerns about privacy risks associated with multimodal data, such as voiceprints and facial images. Recent distributed collaborative learning has been verified as an effective paradigm for privacy preservation in multimodal tasks. However, they often overlook the privacy distinctions among different modalities, struggling to strike a balance between performance and privacy preservation. Consequently, it poses an intriguing question of maximizing multimodal utilization to improve performance while simultaneously protecting necessary modalities. This paper forms the first attempt at modality-specified (i.e., audio and visual) privacy preservation in MSA tasks. We propose a novel Hybrid Distributed cross-modality cGAN framework (HyDiscGAN), which learns multimodality alignment to generate fake audio and visual features conditioned on shareable de-identified textual data. The objective is to leverage the fake features to approximate real audio and visual content to guarantee privacy preservation while effectively enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show that compared with the state-of-the-art MSA model, HyDiscGAN can achieve superior or competitive performance while preserving privacy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modality and View Selection for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of human emotions, traditionally a cornerstone in fields like psychology and neuroscience, has been profoundly impacted by the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Multiple channels, such as speech (voice) and facial expressions (image), are crucial in understanding human emotions. However, AI's journey in multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is marked by substantial technical challenges. One significant hurdle is how AI models manage the absence of a particular modality - a frequent occurrence in real-world situations. This study's central focus is assessing the performance and resilience of two strategies when confronted with the lack of one modality: a novel multimodal dynamic modality and view selection and a cross-attention mechanism. Results on the RECOLA dataset show that dynamic selection-based methods are a promising approach for MER. In the missing modalities scenarios, all dynamic selection-based methods outperformed the baseline. The study concludes by emphasizing the intricate interplay between audio and video modalities in emotion prediction, showcasing the adaptability of dynamic selection methods in handling missing modalities.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Interpretation Corpus Construction by Large Language Models in Distant Language Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) systems, training with a simultaneous interpretation (SI) corpus is an effective method for achieving high-quality yet low-latency systems. However, it is very challenging to curate such a corpus due to limitations in the abilities of annotators, and hence, existing SI corpora are limited. Therefore, we propose a method to convert existing speech translation corpora into interpretation-style data, maintaining the original word order and preserving the entire source content using Large Language Models (LLM-SI-Corpus). We demonstrate that fine-tuning SiMT models in text-to-text and speech-to-text settings with the LLM-SI-Corpus reduces latencies while maintaining the same level of quality as the models trained with offline datasets. The LLM-SI-Corpus is available at \url{https://github.com/yusuke1997/LLM-SI-Corpus}.</description>

      <title>Vesper: A Compact and Effective Pretrained Model for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a paradigm that adapts general large-scale pretrained models (PTMs) to speech emotion recognition task. Although PTMs shed new light on artificial general intelligence, they are constructed with general tasks in mind, and thus, their efficacy for specific tasks can be further improved. Additionally, employing PTMs in practical applications can be challenging due to their considerable size. Above limitations spawn another research direction, namely, optimizing large-scale PTMs for specific tasks to generate task-specific PTMs that are both compact and effective. In this paper, we focus on the speech emotion recognition task and propose an improved emotion-specific pretrained encoder called Vesper. Vesper is pretrained on a speech dataset based on WavLM and takes into account emotional characteristics. To enhance sensitivity to emotional information, Vesper employs an emotion-guided masking strategy to identify the regions that need masking. Subsequently, Vesper employs hierarchical and cross-layer self-supervision to improve its ability to capture acoustic and semantic representations, both of which are crucial for emotion recognition. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP, MELD, and CREMA-D datasets demonstrate that Vesper with 4 layers outperforms WavLM Base with 12 layers, and the performance of Vesper with 12 layers surpasses that of WavLM Large with 24 layers.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition using Advanced Deep Learning Approaches: A survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have posed a significant challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR). ASR relies on extensive training datasets, including confidential ones, and demands substantial computational and storage resources. Enabling adaptive systems improves ASR performance in dynamic environments. DL techniques assume training and testing data originate from the same domain, which is not always true. Advanced DL techniques like deep transfer learning (DTL), federated learning (FL), and reinforcement learning (RL) address these issues. DTL allows high-performance models using small yet related datasets, FL enables training on confidential data without dataset possession, and RL optimizes decision-making in dynamic environments, reducing computation costs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of DTL, FL, and RL-based ASR frameworks, aiming to provide insights into the latest developments and aid researchers and professionals in understanding the current challenges. Additionally, transformers, which are advanced DL techniques heavily used in proposed ASR frameworks, are considered in this survey for their ability to capture extensive dependencies in the input ASR sequence. The paper starts by presenting the background of DTL, FL, RL, and Transformers and then adopts a well-designed taxonomy to outline the state-of-the-art approaches. Subsequently, a critical analysis is conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each framework. Additionally, a comparative study is presented to highlight the existing challenges, paving the way for future research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Wav2code: Restore Clean Speech Representations via Codebook Lookup for Noise-Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has gained remarkable successes thanks to recent advances of deep learning, but it usually degrades significantly under real-world noisy conditions. Recent works introduce speech enhancement (SE) as front-end to improve speech quality, which is proved effective but may not be optimal for downstream ASR due to speech distortion problem. Based on that, latest works combine SE and currently popular self-supervised learning (SSL) to alleviate distortion and improve noise robustness. Despite the effectiveness, the speech distortion caused by conventional SE still cannot be cleared out. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework named Wav2code to implement a feature-level SE with reduced distortions for noise-robust ASR. First, in pre-training stage the clean speech representations from SSL model are sent to lookup a discrete codebook via nearest-neighbor feature matching, the resulted code sequence are then exploited to reconstruct the original clean representations, in order to store them in codebook as prior. Second, during finetuning we propose a Transformer-based code predictor to accurately predict clean codes by modeling the global dependency of input noisy representations, which enables discovery and restoration of high-quality clean representations with reduced distortions. Furthermore, we propose an interactive feature fusion network to combine original noisy and the restored clean representations to consider both fidelity and quality, resulting in more informative features for downstream ASR. Finally, experiments on both synthetic and real noisy datasets demonstrate that Wav2code can solve the speech distortion and improve ASR performance under various noisy conditions, resulting in stronger robustness.</description>

Abstract: This paper summarizes the cinematic demixing (CDX) track of the Sound Demixing Challenge 2023 (SDX'23). We provide a comprehensive summary of the challenge setup, detailing the structure of the competition and the datasets used. Especially, we detail CDXDB23, a new hidden dataset constructed from real movies that was used to rank the submissions. The paper also offers insights into the most successful approaches employed by participants. Compared to the cocktail-fork baseline, the best-performing system trained exclusively on the simulated Divide and Remaster (DnR) dataset achieved an improvement of 1.8 dB in SDR, whereas the top-performing system on the open leaderboard, where any data could be used for training, saw a significant improvement of 5.7 dB. A significant source of this improvement was making the simulated data better match real cinematic audio, which we further investigate in detail.</description>

      <title>Open vocabulary keyword spotting through transfer learning from speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying keywords in an open-vocabulary context is crucial for personalizing interactions with smart devices. Previous approaches to open vocabulary keyword spotting dependon a shared embedding space created by audio and text encoders. However, these approaches suffer from heterogeneous modality representations (i.e., audio-text mismatch). To address this issue, our proposed framework leverages knowledge acquired from a pre-trained text-to-speech (TTS) system. This knowledge transfer allows for the incorporation of awareness of audio projections into the text representations derived from the text encoder. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with various baseline methods across four different datasets. The robustness of our proposed model is evaluated by assessing its performance across different word lengths and in an Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) scenario. Additionally, the effectiveness of transfer learning from the TTS system is investigated by analyzing its different intermediate representations. The experimental results indicate that, in the challenging LibriPhrase Hard dataset, the proposed approach outperformed the cross-modality correspondence detector (CMCD) method by a significant improvement of 8.22% in area under the curve (AUC) and 12.56% in equal error rate (EER).</description>

      <title>Llama-VITS: Enhancing TTS Synthesis with Semantic Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have seen Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing high-quality text for various purposes. Notably, in Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems, the integration of BERT for semantic token generation has underscored the importance of semantic content in producing coherent speech outputs. Despite this, the specific utility of LLMs in enhancing TTS synthesis remains considerably limited. This research introduces an innovative approach, Llama-VITS, which enhances TTS synthesis by enriching the semantic content of text using LLM. Llama-VITS integrates semantic embeddings from Llama2 with the VITS model, a leading end-to-end TTS framework. By leveraging Llama2 for the primary speech synthesis process, our experiments demonstrate that Llama-VITS matches the naturalness of the original VITS (ORI-VITS) and those incorporate BERT (BERT-VITS), on the LJSpeech dataset, a substantial collection of neutral, clear speech. Moreover, our method significantly enhances emotive expressiveness on the EmoV_DB_bea_sem dataset, a curated selection of emotionally consistent speech from the EmoV_DB dataset, highlighting its potential to generate emotive speech.</description>
