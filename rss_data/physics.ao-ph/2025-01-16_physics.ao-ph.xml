      <title>Physically Interpretable Emulation of a Moist Convecting Atmosphere with a Recurrent Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven convective parameterization aims to accurately represent convective adjustments to large-scale forcings in a computationally economic manner. While previous studies have demonstrated success using various model architectures, challenges persist in developing physically interpretable models and assessing generalizability and confidence level. In this study, we develop a recurrent neural network to predict time series of temperature, moisture, and precipitation of a cumulus ensemble in response to large-scale forcings. The recurrent cell combines a linear component, pre-identified as a time-invariant state-space model within the linear limit of the problem, and a multilayer neural network for the nonlinear component. Trained on ensembles of limited-domain cloud-resolving model simulation data, the model exhibits stable and realistic performance in long-term emulations, both with prescribed large-scale forcings and when coupled with two-dimensional gravity waves. We further calculate linear responses to perturbations for the coupled emulation, revealing physically interpretable, state-dependent properties of the convectively coupled gravity wave system.</description>

      <title>The Turbulent Plume from Wildland Fire in Sheared Boundary Layer Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background. Smoke plumes from wildland fires are significant hazards, impacting public health and facilitating fire spotting. In crossflow conditions, typically characterized by vertical shear within the planetary boundary layer, smoke plumes bend downstream of the fire. This bending confines the plume within the boundary layer, delaying its dispersion and increasing fire spotting risks. Aims. This study aims to investigate the bending height of smoke plumes influenced by a sheared crossflow and stratified atmospheric conditions, providing insights into smoke dispersion and fire behavior. Methods. Radar observations from a prescribed fire experiment reveal a large-scale billow-like vorticity pair associated with plume bending. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) in the CM1 model are used to replicate these observations. Key Results. A scaling analysis estimates the plume bending height by incorporating a modified Byram's convective number to account for sheared crossflow. The bending height increases with higher fire intensity, more unstable stratification, and weaker crossflow shear. Simulated results align well with the scaling analysis, highlighting the significance of shear and stratification in plume dynamics. Conclusions. Plume bending height is strongly influenced by fire intensity, atmospheric stratification, and crossflow shear. Incorporating these factors improves our understanding of smoke plume behavior. Implications. The findings enhance smoke dispersion modeling and risk assessment for fire spotting, aiding in the development of strategies to mitigate wildfire impacts.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for phase-resolved data assimilation and prediction of nonlinear ocean waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assimilation and prediction of phase-resolved surface gravity waves are critical challenges in ocean science and engineering. Potential flow theory (PFT) has been widely employed to develop wave models and numerical techniques for wave prediction. However, traditional wave prediction methods are often limited. For example, most simplified wave models have a limited ability to capture strong wave nonlinearity, while fully nonlinear PFT solvers often fail to meet the speed requirements of engineering applications. This computational inefficiency also hinders the development of effective data assimilation techniques, which are required to reconstruct spatial wave information from sparse measurements to initialize the wave prediction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solver method that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that parameterize PFT solutions as neural networks. This provides a computationally inexpensive way to assimilate and predict wave data. The proposed PINN framework is validated through comparisons with analytical linear PFT solutions and experimental data collected in a laboratory wave flume. The results demonstrate that our approach accurately captures and predicts irregular, nonlinear, and dispersive wave surface dynamics. Moreover, the PINN can infer the fully nonlinear velocity potential throughout the entire fluid volume solely from surface elevation measurements, enabling the calculation of fluid velocities that are difficult to measure experimentally.</description>

      <title>On idealized models of turbulent condensation in clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various microphysical models attempt to explain the occurrence of broad droplet size distributions (DSD) in clouds through approximate representations of the stochastic droplet growth by condensation in a turbulent environment. This work analyzes specific idealized models, where the variability of droplet growth conditions arises primarily from variability in the turbulent vertical velocity of the air carrying these droplets. Examples are the stochastic eddy hopping model operating in adiabatic parcels and certain types of DNS-like models. We show that such models produce droplet size statistics that are spatially inhomogeneous along the vertical direction, causing the predicted DSD to depend on the DSD spatial sampling scale $\Delta$. In these models, $\Delta$ is implicitly related to the spatial extent of the droplets turbulent diffusion (approximated by Brownian-like excursions) and thus grows like $t^{1/2}$. This leads to spurious continuous DSD broadening, as the growth in time (also like $t^{1/2}$) of the standard deviation of droplet squared radius arises essentially from the growth of the sampling scale $\Delta$. Also, the DSDs predicted by the models discussed here are not necessarily locally broad (in the sense that large and small droplets might not be well-mixed in sufficiently small volumes) and thus do not necessarily indicate enhanced probabilities of gravity-induced droplet coagulation. In the effort to build a firm physical basis for subgrid parametrizations, this study presents a framework to explain the merits and limitations of idealized models, indicating how to assess and use them wisely as a subgrid representation of turbulent condensation in large-eddy simulations of clouds.</description>

      <title>A stochastic model for the turbulent ocean heat flux under Arctic sea ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.11815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of planetary climate features a variety of complex systems that are challenging to model as they feature turbulent flows. A key example is the heat flux from the upper ocean to the underside of sea ice which provides a key contribution to the evolution of the Arctic sea ice cover. Here, we develop a model of the turbulent ice-ocean heat flux using coupled ordinary stochastic differential equations to model fluctuations in the vertical velocity and temperature in the Arctic mixed layer. All the parameters in the model are determined from observational data. A detailed comparison between the model results and measurements made during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) project reveals that the model is able to capture the probability density functions (PDFs) of velocity, temperature and heat flux fluctuations. Furthermore, we show that the temperature in the upper layer of the Arctic ocean can be treated as a passive scalar during the whole year of SHEBA measurements. The stochastic model developed here provides a computationally inexpensive way to compute an observationally consistent PDF of this heat flux, and has implications for its parametrization in regional and global climate models.</description>

      <title>Removing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Using Large Land Or Ocean Areas Will Change Earth Albedo And Force Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When large surface areas of the Earth are altered, radiative forcing due to changes in surface reflectance can drive climate change. Yet to achieve the necessary scale to remove the substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere relevant for ameliorating climate change, enhanced rock weathering (ERW) will need to be applied to very large land areas. Likewise, marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) must alter a large fraction of the ocean surface waters to have a significant impact upon climate. We show that surface albedo modification (SAM) associated with ERW or mCDR can easily overwhelm the radiative forcing from the decrease of atmospheric CO2 over years or even decades. A change in albedo as small as parts per thousand has a radiative impact comparable to the removal of 10 tons of carbon per hectare. SAM via ERW can be either cooling or warming. We identify some of the many questions raised by radiative forcing due to these forms of CDR.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Emulator for Atmospheric Chemical ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling atmospheric chemistry is complex and computationally intense. Given the recent success of Deep neural networks in digital signal processing, we propose a Neural Network Emulator for fast chemical concentration modeling. We consider atmospheric chemistry as a time-dependent Ordinary Differential Equation. To extract the hidden correlations between initial states and future time evolution, we propose ChemNNE, an Attention based Neural Network Emulator (NNE) that can model the atmospheric chemistry as a neural ODE process. To efficiently simulate the chemical changes, we propose the sinusoidal time embedding to estimate the oscillating tendency over time. More importantly, we use the Fourier neural operator to model the ODE process for efficient computation. We also propose three physical-informed losses to supervise the training optimization. To evaluate our model, we propose a large-scale chemical dataset that can be used for neural network training and evaluation. The extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling accuracy and computational speed.</description>
