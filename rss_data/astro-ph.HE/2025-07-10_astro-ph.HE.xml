      <title>IXPE view of the Sco-like source GX 349+2 in the normal branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed spectropolarimetric study of the Sco-like Z-source GX 349+2, simultaneously observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). During the observations GX 349+2 was found mainly in the normal branch. A model-independent polarimetric analysis yields a polarisation degree of $1.1\% \pm 0.3\%$ at a polarisation angle of $29{\deg} \pm 7{\deg}$ in the 2--8 keV band, with ${\sim}4.1\sigma$ confidence level significance. No variability of polarisation in time and flux has been observed, while an energy-resolved analysis shows a complex dependence of polarisation on energy, as confirmed by a spectropolarimetric analysis. Spectral modeling reveals a dominant disc blackbody component and a Comptonising emitting region, with evidence of a broad iron line associated with a reflection component. Spectropolarimetric fits suggest differing polarisation properties for the disc and Comptonised components, slightly favouring a spreading layer geometry. The polarisation of the Comptonised component exceeds the theoretical expectations, but is in line with the results for other Z-sources with similar inclination. A study of the reflection's polarisation is also reported, with polarisation degree ranging around 10% depending on the assumptions. Despite GX 349+2's classification as a Sco-like source, these polarimetric results align more closely with the Cyg-like system GX 340+0 of similar inclination. This indicates that polarisation is governed primarily by accretion state and orbital inclination, rather than by the subclass to which the source belongs.</description>

      <title>Mass Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers from Young and Old Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense star clusters are thought to contribute significantly to the merger rates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic dense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger rate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in these environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably old globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses $M_p\approx30\,M_{\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower redshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce lower-mass BBH mergers. We find that cluster BBH mergers span a wide range of primary mass, from about $6\,M_{\odot}$ to above $100\,M_{\odot}$, with a peak near $8\,M_{\odot}$, reproducing the overall merger rate distribution inferred from gravitational wave detections. Our results show that most low-mass BBH mergers (about $95\%$ with $M_p\lesssim 20\,M_{\odot}$) originate in metal-rich ($Z \sim Z_{\odot}$) dense star clusters, while more massive BBH mergers form predominately in metal-poor globular clusters. We also discuss the role of hierarchical mergers in shaping the BBH mass distribution. Gravitational wave detection of dynamically-formed low-mass BBH mergers -- potentially identifiable by features such as isotropic spin distributions -- may serve as probes of cluster formation histories in metal-rich environments at low redshifts.</description>

      <title>20 GeV halo-like excess of the Galactic diffuse emission and implications for dark matter annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60$ deg, $10 \le |b| \le 60$ deg) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a sharp peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which does not depend on GALPROP or other model templates. The halo excess can be fitted by the annihilation spectrum with a mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Three-Flavor Composition of Astrophysical Neutrinos with Contained IceCube Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole detects neutrinos from the entire sky, both of astrophysical and atmospheric origin, via the Cherenkov light emitted when these neutrinos interact in the ice, giving rise to rapidly moving charged particles. Neutrino events with vertices contained within the detector volume are useful for studying the neutrino flavor ratio, as they allow for a better reconstruction of the event morphology. The Medium Energy Starting Events (MESE) data sample is a selection of such events with energies of at least 1 TeV. This sample includes electron-, muon-, and tau-neutrino events, processed consistently. We use it to constrain the flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos at Earth, which in turn informs us of the flavor composition at the source itself. In this talk, we will present the results of this study, based on 11.4 years of IceCube data.</description>

      <title>Machine learning driven reconstruction of cosmic-ray air showers for next generation radio arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface radio antenna-based measurements of cosmic-ray air showers present significant computational challenges in accurately reconstructing physics observables, in particular, the depth of shower maximum, X$_{max}$. State-of-the-art template fitting methods rely on extensive simulation libraries, limiting scalability. This work introduces a technique utilizing graph neural networks to reconstruct key air-shower parameters, in particular, direction and shower-core, energy, and X$_{max}$. For training and testing of the networks, we use a CoREAS simulation library made for a future enhancement of IceCube's surface array with radio antennas. The neural networks provide a scalable framework for large-scale data analysis for next-generation astroparticle observatories, such as IceCube-Gen2.</description>

      <title>Determining the orientation of radio antennas at the South Pole using Galactic noise measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a multi-messenger observatory at the South Pole. As preparation for an enhancement of its surface array, IceTop, a prototype station consisting of elevated scintillation panels and radio antennas has been installed and is operating since 2020. The radio antennas detect emissions from cosmic-ray-induced air showers, and their precise orientation is essential for an accurate reconstruction of the air-shower properties. This work presents a novel method to determine the orientation by analyzing periodic variations of the Galactic background noise recorded by the antennas. In particular, we examine noise level variations correlated with the Earth's rotation and the apparent position of the Galactic Center. The method can provide a potential alternative or augment GPS-based measurements of the alignment of radio antennas at the South Pole.</description>

      <title>IXPE Observations of the Blazar Mrk 501 in 2022: A Multiwavelength View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blazar Markarian 501 (Mrk 501) was observed on three occasions over a 4-month period between 2022 March and 2022 July with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In this paper, we report for the first time on the third IXPE observation, performed between 2022 July 9 and 12, during which IXPE detected a linear polarization degree of $\Pi_X=6\pm2$ per cent at a polarization angle, measured east of north, of $\Psi_X=143^\circ\pm11^\circ$ within the 2-8 keV X-ray band. The X-ray polarization angle and degree during this observation are consistent with those obtained during the first two observations. The chromaticity of the polarization across radio, optical, and X-ray bands is likewise consistent with the result from the simultaneous campaigns during the first two observations. Furthermore, we present two types of models to explain the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and energy-resolved polarization: a synchrotron self-Compton model with an anisotropic magnetic field probability distribution in the emitting volume, as well as an energy-stratified shock model. Our results support both the shock scenario as well as support that small levels of magnetic field anisotropy can explain the observed polarization.</description>

      <title>Status and performance of mass-produced IceCube Upgrade mDOMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceCube Upgrade, starting in the Antarctic summer season 2025/2026, will enhance the sensitivity of the current IceCube in the GeV range and improve understanding of the ice properties. Around 700 new modules will be deployed deep in the ice along seven strings, spaced $3\,\mathrm{m}$ vertically within a horizontal region of $100\,\mathrm{m}$. IceCube Upgrade mainly consists of two types of Cherenkov photon detectors, $\sim280$ Dual optical sensors in an Ellipsoid Glass for Gen2 (D-Eggs) and $\sim400$ multi-PMT Digital Optical Modules (mDOMs). Here, we present the status of mDOM production and acceptance testing for mass-produced mDOMs. The majority of the modules have already been produced, and all 128 modules on the first 2 strings have been successfully shipped to the South Pole after multiple steps of testing. Each mDOM contains 24 photomultipliers nearly isotropically distributed on the surface to achieve uniform photon sensitivity, making the integration and testing complicated. To reduce the amount of testing time, we have developed parallelized and automated software.</description>

      <title>All-sky neutrino point-source search with IceCube combined track and cascade data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive efforts, discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources remains elusive. We present an event-level simultaneous maximum likelihood analysis of tracks and cascades using IceCube data collected from April 6, 2008 to May 23, 2022 to search the whole sky for neutrino sources and, using a source catalog, for coincidence of neutrino emission with gamma-ray emission. This is the first time a simultaneous fit of different detection channels is used to conduct a time-integrated all-sky scan with IceCube. Combining all-sky tracks, with superior pointing-power and sensitivity in the northern sky, with all-sky cascades, with good energy-resolution and sensitivity in the southern sky, we have developed the most sensitive point-source search to date by IceCube which targets the entire sky. The most significant point in the northern sky aligns with NGC 1068, a Seyfert II galaxy, which shows a 3.5$\sigma$ excess over background after accounting for trials. The most significant point in the southern sky does not align with any source in the catalog and is not significant after accounting for trials. A search for the single most significant Gaussian flare at the locations of NGC 1068, PKS 1424+240, and the southern highest significance point shows results consistent with expectations for steady emission. Notably, this is the first time that a flare shorter than four years has been excluded as being responsible for NGC 1068's emergence as a neutrino source. Our results show that combining tracks and cascades when conducting neutrino source searches improves sensitivity and can lead to new discoveries.</description>

      <title>AT2019cmw: A highly luminous, cooling featureless TDE candidate from the disruption of a high mass star in an early-type galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical/UV photometric and spectroscopic observations, as well as X-ray and radio follow-up, of the extraordinary event AT2019cmw. With a peak bolometric luminosity of ~$\mathrm{10^{45.6}\,erg\,s^{-1}}$, it is one of the most luminous thermal transients ever discovered. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up post-peak showed only a featureless continuum throughout its evolution. This, combined with its nuclear location, blue colour at peak and lack of prior evidence of an AGN in its host lead us to interpret this event as a `featureless' tidal disruption event (TDE). It displays photometric evolution atypical of most TDEs, cooling from ~30 kK to ~10 kK in the first ~300 days post-peak, with potential implications for future photometric selection of candidate TDEs. No X-ray or radio emission is detected, placing constraints on the presence of on-axis jetted emission or a visible inner-accretion disk. Modelling the optical light curve with existing theoretical prescriptions, we find that AT2019cmw may be the result of the disruption of a star in the tens of solar masses by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Combined with a lack of detectable star formation in its host galaxy, it could imply the existence of a localised region of star formation around the SMBH. This could provide a new window to probe nuclear star formation and the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) in close proximity to SMBHs out to relatively high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Classification of high energy muon bundles and single muons from the southern sky in IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the geographic South Pole, uses the glacial ice volume to detect astrophysical neutrinos. Detection of the neutrinos from the northern sky provides the opportunity to use a large effective volume. However, as the cross-section increases with energy, most high-energy neutrinos are absorbed by the Earth. On the other hand, probing down-going PeV neutrinos from the southern sky becomes challenging because of the large cosmic ray induced muon backgrounds. This contribution presents a method for classifying atmospheric muon bundles and single muons by analyzing the lateral and longitudinal characteristics of through-going track-like events from the southern sky. Muons generated in cosmic ray air showers form muon bundles, exhibiting a lateral spread spanning tens of meters within IceCube. We explore the time residual feature for the observed Cherenkov light to separate bundles from single muons. We also utilize energy losses along the track, which lead to fluctuations in the light intensity: bundles follow a smooth pattern, whereas single muons are more stochastic. A Boosted Decision Tree algorithm is trained on simulated, well-reconstructed cosmic ray and neutrino events to classify neutrino-induced single muons and cosmic ray bundles.</description>

      <title>Investigating non-Keplerian motion in flare events with astrometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GRAVITY interferometer has achieved microarcsecond precision in near-infrared interferometry, enabling tracking of flare centroid motion in the strong gravitational field near the Sgr A*. It might be promising to serve as a unique laboratory for exploring the accretion matter near black holes or testing Einstein's gravity. Recent studies debated whether there is a non-Keplerian motion of the flares in the GRAVITY dataset. It motivates us to present a comprehensive analysis based on error estimation under the Bayesian framework. This study uses asctrometric flare data to investigate the possibility that the flares exhibit deviations from the circular Keplerian motion. By fixing the black hole mass of Sgr A* and using the averaged astrometric data from the four flares, our results find that the super-Keplerian orbit is favored at the near $1\sigma$ confidence level, where the non-Keperian parameter is $\omega/\omega_k=1.45^{+0.35}_{-0.38}$. By treating the black hole mass as a free parameter, both the averaged and individual data exhibit no significant evidence in favor of non-Keplerian motions, where the non-Keplerian parameter is close to $1$ within $1\sigma$ confidence level. We further analyze flares undergoing planar geodesic motion, where the orbital circularity parameter is $\gamma = 0.99_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$. This indicates that the astrometric data favor the circular orbits. Future improvements in astrometry precision might enable stronger constraints on the kinematical behavior of the flares, potentially offering insights into black hole physics or accretion matter in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Imaging-Spectroscopic diagnosis of the Giant Sloshing Spiral in the Virgo Cluster with the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed deep X-ray observations of the Virgo cluster using the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT) with a total exposure of 295 ks. Leveraging the large field of view (FoV) and low particle background of EP-FXT, the image reveals a giant spiral feature connecting the cold fronts in the northwest and southeast, forming a coherent structure consistent with earlier results from XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also present two-dimensional maps of temperature, metallicity, and entropy across the Virgo Cluster, covering a FoV of approximately 28.5 arcmin. These maps clearly show a spiral structure with high density, low temperature, high metallicity, and low entropy. The results support a scenario where the spiral morphology arises from gas sloshing driven by a minor merger. Additionally, EP-FXT temperature measurements agree well with XMM-Newton data within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Advanced Northern Tracks Selection using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer detector located in the Antarctic ice at the geographic South Pole. It reads out over 5,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect Cherenkov light produced by secondary particles, enabling IceCube to identify both atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. One of the main challenges in this effort is effectively distinguishing between muons induced by neutrinos and those generated by cosmic-ray air showers. To address this challenge, the Advanced Northern Tracks Selection (ANTS) employs a graph convolutional neural network. This network is designed to utilize both the sensor data and the geometric arrangement of the detector's photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). By representing each module as a node in a graph and extracting features from each module, the network can capture and integrate both local and global features. This work details the implementation of the network architecture and highlights the improvements in background rejection efficiency compared to existing methods for selecting muon tracks.</description>

      <title>New Public Neutrino Alerts for Clusters of IceCube Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory searches for the origins of astrophysical neutrinos using various techniques to overcome the significant backgrounds produced by cosmic-ray air showers. One such technique involves combining the neutrino data with other cosmic messengers to identify spatial and temporal correlations. IceCube contributes to multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA) by providing alerts for interesting events observed in the detector. The Gamma-ray Follow-Up (GFU) cluster alert system is one stream that identifies potential neutrino flares in realtime, producing around 20 alerts per year. GFU-cluster alerts have been privately shared with Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) through memoranda of understanding since IceCube's predecessor, AMANDA. To preserve blindness to the full behavior of our data, the current system mutes updates from sources following the initial GFU-cluster alert sent, preventing further updates until the activity drops below the alert threshold. With growing knowledge of the potential environments that produce astrophysical neutrinos and to foster open collaboration, the GFU-cluster alerts will shift to be publicly shared. Additionally, the new alert platform will provide all above-threshold information such that the source behavior after the initial alert is not obscured. The above threshold data will be distributed through an interactive website that will update the community on the status of active GFU-cluster alerts. This presentation will introduce the new GFU-cluster platform and the accompanying website, soon to be accessible to the MMA community.</description>

      <title>A search for extremely-high-energy neutrinos with IceCube and implications for the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray proton fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) interact with ambient photon backgrounds, a flux of extremely-high-energy (EHE), so-called cosmogenic, neutrinos is produced. The observation of these neutrinos with IceCube can probe the nature of UHECRs. We present a search for EHE neutrinos using $12.6 \, \mathrm{years}$ of IceCube data. The non-observation of neutrinos with energies $\gtrsim 10 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at $1 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be below $E^2 \Phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} \simeq 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. This constrains the proton fraction in UHECRs of energy above $30 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\lesssim 70\%$ if the evolution of the UHECR sources is similar to the star formation rate. Our analysis circumvents uncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models in studies of UHECR air showers, which also suggest a heavy composition at such energies.</description>

      <title>Circular polarization of fast radio bursts by asymmetric erosion in longitudinally magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are likely to be the origin of all fast radio bursts. The recent detection of circularly polarized bursts suggests that they might be generated deep inside magnetar magnetospheres. However, the mechanism behind the circular polarization remains uncertain. Here, we study the propagation of an intense radio pulse in a longitudinally magnetized electron-dominant plasma by particle-in-cell simulations. When the field strength of the radio pulse exceeds the background magnetic field, it can excite a nonlinear plasma wakefield and continually erodes due to energy transfer to the wake. Along the magnetic field, the plasma wakefield launched by the right-circularly polarized pulse is much stronger and more nonlinear than that by the left-circularly polarized pulse. Hence, the erosion rates of the two circularly polarized modes are significantly different. We discover that this asymmetric erosion can generate circularly polarized modes from a linearly polarized pulse at relativistic intensities, even when the cyclotron frequency is much higher than the radio frequency. Finally, we present a proof-of-principle simulation to demonstrate the generation of circularly polarization by this magneto-induced asymmetric erosion in the nonuniform environment of magnetar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous stellar mixing in the final hours before the Cassiopeia A supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding stars and their evolution is a key goal of astronomical research and has long been a focus of human interest. In recent years, theorists have paid much attention to the final interior processes within massive stars, as they can be essential for revealing neutrino-driven supernova mechanisms and other potential transients of massive star collapse. However, it is challenging to observe directly the last hours of a massive star before explosion, since it is the supernova event that triggers the start of intense observational study. Here we report evidence for a final phase of stellar activity known as a ``shell merger'', an intense shell burning in which the O-burning shell swallows its outer C-/Ne-burning shell, deep within the progenitor's interior moments before the supernova explosion. In the violent convective layer created by the shell merger, Ne, which is abundant in the stellar O-rich layer, is burned as it is pulled inward, and Si, which is synthesized inside, is transported outward. The remnant still preserves some traces of such Ne-rich downflows and Si-rich upflows in the O-rich layer, suggesting that inhomogeneous shell-merger mixing began just hours ($\lesssim 10^4$ s) before its gravitational collapse. Our results provide the first observational evidence that the final stellar burning process rapidly alters the internal structure, leaving a pre-supernova asymmetry. This breaking of spherical symmetry facilitates the explosion of massive stars and influences various supernova and remnant characteristics, including explosion asymmetries and the neutron star's kick and spin.</description>

      <title>MHD Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for shock waves in van der Waals gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we have presented non-relativistic boundary conditions across a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shock front propagating in van der Waals gases. The expression for the strength of the non-relativistic MHD shock wave has been obtained, and the Rankine-Hugoniot (R-H) shock jump relations, or boundary conditions, for the pressure, the density, and the particle velocity across an MHD shock front have been derived in terms of a shock compression ratio. The simplified forms of shock jump relations have been written simultaneously for the weak and strong MHD shock waves in terms of the magnetic field strength, the non-idealness parameter, and the ratio of specific heats of the gas. Further, the case of weak shocks has been explored under two distinct conditions, viz., (i) when the applied magnetic field is weak and (ii) when the field is strong, respectively. The case of strong shocks has also been investigated under two distinct ways: (i) as in the purely non-magnetic case, when the ratio of densities on either side of the shock nearly equals $(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)$ or (ii) when the applied magnetic field is large. This is when the ambient magnetic pressure is large as compared with the ambient gas pressure. Finally, the effects on the shock strength and the pressure across the MHD shock front are studied due to the magnetic field strength and the non-idealness parameter of the gases. This study presents an overview of the influence of the magnetic field strength and the non-idealness parameter on the shock strength, the pressure, the density, and the particle velocity across the MHD shock front in van der Waals gases.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Natal Kicks on Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter the orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are predicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and no baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released via neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their emission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH) formation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the gravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low natal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate natal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a decrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For large natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain bound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence. For binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to reconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario. This suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only arise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work. Consequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries within the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind complete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete collapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help shed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be needed to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar collapse in BH formation.</description>

Abstract: FRB 20180916B is a repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) which produces bursts in a 5.1 day active window which repeats with a 16.34 day period. Models have been proposed to explain the periodicity using dynamical phenomena such as rotation, precession or orbital motion. Polarization Position Angle (PA) of the bursts can be used to distinguish and constraint the origin of the long term periodicity of the FRB. We aim to study the PA variability on short (within an observation) and long timescales (from observation to observation). We aim to compare the observed PA variability with the predictions of various dynamical progenitor models for the FRB. We use the calibrated burst dataset detected by uGMRT in Band 4 (650 MHz) which have been published in arXiv:2409.12584 . We transform the PA measured at 650 MHz to infinite frequency such that PAs measured in different observations are consistent, and finally measure the changes within and across active windows. We find that PA of the bursts vary according to the periodicity of the source. We constrain the PA variability to be within seven degrees on timescales less than four hours for all MJDs. In addition, we also tentatively note the PA measured at the same phase in the active window varies from one cycle to another. Using the findings, we constrain rotational, precession and binary progenitor models. Rotational model partially agrees with observed PA variability but requires further study to fully constrain. We robustly rule out all flavors of precessional models where either precession explains the periodicity of the FRB or the variability from one cycle to another. Lastly, we draw similarities between FRB 20180916B and a X-ray binary system, Her X 1, and explicitly note that both the sources exhibit a similar form of PA variability.</description>

      <title>Generative Neural Network for Simulating Radio Emission from Extensive Air Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray shower detection using large radio arrays has gained significant traction in recent years. With massive improvements in signal modelling and microscopic simulations, the analysis of incoming events is still severely limited by the simulation cost of radio emission to interpret the data. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used for simulating such radio pulses. We also demonstrate how such a neural network can be used for $X_\mathrm{max}$ reconstruction, while retaining comparable resolution to using full Monte-Carlo CORSIKA/CoREAS simulations for radio emission.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disks II: Merger Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.</description>

      <title>The Scintillator Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data collected so far by the Pierre Auger Observatory have enabled major advances in ultra-high energy cosmic ray physics and demonstrated that improved determination of masses of primary cosmic-ray particles, preferably on an event-by-event basis, is necessary for understanding their origin and nature. Improvement in primary mass measurements was the main motivation for the upgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory, called AugerPrime. As part of this upgrade, scintillator detectors are added to the existing water-Cherenkov surface detector stations. By making use of the differences in detector response to the electromagnetic particles and muons between scintillator and water-Cherenkov detectors, the electromagnetic and muonic components of cosmic-ray air showers can be disentangled. Since the muonic component is sensitive to the primary mass, such combination of detectors provides a powerful way to improve primary mass composition measurements over the original Auger surface detector design. In this paper, the so-called Scintillator Surface Detectors are discussed, including their design characteristics, production process, testing procedure and deployment in the field.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Lanthanide Atomic Data for Kilonova Radiative Transfer. I. Atomic Structure and Opacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early spectra of the kilonova (KN) AT2017gfo following the binary neutron star merger GW170817 exhibit numerous features shaped by r-process nucleosynthesis products. Although a few species were tentatively detected, no third-peak elements were unambiguously identified, as the amount of atomic data required for radiative transfer modeling is immense. Although comprehensive atomic data, including atomic opacities, is now available for many elements, wavelength-calibrated data remains limited to a select few ions. To examine the atomic opacities of all singly and doubly ionized lanthanides, from La (Z = 57) to Yb (Z = 70), we perform atomic structure calculations using the FAC code. Our calculations incorporate an innovative optimization of the local central potential and the number of configurations considered, alongside a calibration technique aimed at enhancing agreement between theoretical and experimental atomic energy levels. We assess the accuracy of the computed data, including energy levels and electric dipole (E1) transition strengths, as well as their impact on KN opacities. We find that strong transitions ($\log(gf)&gt;-1$) are in good agreement with both experiments and semi-empirical calculations. For ions with substantial experimental data, the computed opacities exhibit good agreement with prior calculations. By calibrating low-lying energy levels with experimental data, we have identified 66,591 transitions with experimentally calibrated wavelength information, rendering future lanthanide line identifications through radiative transfer modeling feasible. In total, our calculations encompass 28 ions, yielding 146,856 energy levels below the ionization threshold and 28,690,443 transitions among these levels.</description>

      <title>Probing ultra-high-energy neutrinos with the IceCube-Gen2 in-ice radio array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation neutrino telescope, IceCube-Gen2, will be sensitive to the astrophysical and cosmogenic flux of neutrinos across a broad energy range, from the TeV to the EeV scale. The planned design includes 8 cubic kilometers of ice instrumented with approximately 10,000 optical sensors, a surface array, and a radio array of antennas embedded in the ice laid out sparsely over 500 km^2. The radio array provides sensitivity to ultra-high energy neutrinos using independent radio stations that can trigger on Askaryan emission from neutrino interactions in the ice. In this contribution, we present the design for the radio array along with its planned implementation, which is expected to increase sensitivity to neutrinos with energies beyond 100PeV by at least an order of magnitude over existing arrays. Furthermore, we will quantify the expected science output by presenting measurement forecasts for the main science cases of diffuse flux and point source discovery, as well as cross-section and flavor measurements.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework for UHECR Source Association and Parameter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains challenging due to magnetic deflections and propagation losses, which are particularly strong for nuclei. In previous iterations of this work, we proposed an approach for UHECR astronomy based on Bayesian inference through explicit modelling of propagation and magnetic deflection effects. The event-by-event mass information is expected to provide tighter constraints on these parameters and to help identify unknown sources. However, the measurements of the average mass through observations from the surface detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory already indicate that the UHECR masses are well represented through its statistical average. In this contribution, we present our framework which uses energy and mass moments of $\ln A$ to infer the source parameters of UHECRs, including the mass composition at the source. We demonstrate the performance of our model using simulated datasets based on the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array Project. Our model can be readily applied to currently available data, and we discuss the implications of our results for UHECR source identification.</description>

      <title>A case study of GW190425 for classifying binary neutron star versus binary black hole mergers and constraining asymmetric dark matter with gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO Scientific, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration has identified two binary neutron star merger candidates, GW170817 and GW190425, along with several binary black hole candidates. While GW170817 was confirmed as a BNS merger through its electromagnetic counterparts, GW190425 lacked such observations, leaving its classification uncertain. We examine the possibility that GW190425 originated from black holes that merged after dark matter accretion caused their progenitor neutron stars to implode. Using this event, we place constraints on dark matter parameters, such as its mass and interaction cross section. We simulate GW190425-like events and analyze them using future gravitational wave detector networks, including upcoming upgrades to current detector networks and next-generation observatories. We show that a network with A+ sensitivity can not classify a GW190425-like event with sufficient confidence. Detector networks with A# sensitivity can classify such events only if the neutron stars follow a relatively stiff equation of state, whose stronger tidal imprint differs measurably from a binary black hole waveform. Next-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer recover the tidal signature even for soft, compact stars, enabling confident classification. Finally, we forecast the dark matter constraints that future gravitational wave networks could achieve for similar events.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing rarely produces high-mass outliers to the compact binary population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by intervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a gravitational-wave signal is magnified, it appears to have originated from a closer, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave source population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed events. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population outliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed, nor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers. This is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on observed binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because lensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources, which are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier implies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We additionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical depth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or absence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest gravitational-wave catalog are weak$\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on the optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or more of $\tau(\mu\geq5,z=1)\leq 0.035 \unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs will not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the optical depth. Future work will investigate the ability of the full inferred population of compact binaries to inform the distribution of lenses in the Universe, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and constrain cosmic structures.</description>

Abstract: GRAND (the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) is a proposed next-generation observatory targetting primarily the detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, with energies exceeding about 100 PeV. GRAND is envisioned as a collection of large-scale ground arrays of self-triggered radio antennas that target the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by UHE particles. Three prototype arrays are presently in operation: GRANDProto300 in China, with 65 units running since end of 2024, GRAND@Auger in Argentina with 10 units deployed on the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory, and GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, a 4-unit setup installed at the Nan\c{c}ay radio-observatory and used for test purposes. The main objective of the GRAND prototype phase is to validate the detection principle and technology of GRAND, in preparation for its next phase, GRAND10k. GRAND10k will consist of two arrays of 10'000 antennas each, covering both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, to be deployed from 2030 on. Here we give an overview of the GRAND concept, its science goals, the status of the prototypes, their performances and first detection of cosmic rays, and the technical perspective they open for the future.</description>

      <title>The GRAND@Auger Prototype for the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As of early 2025, the GRAND Collaboration operates three prototype arrays: GRANDProto300 in China, GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, and GRAND@Auger in Argentina. The GRAND@Auger prototype was established through an agreement between the GRAND and Pierre Auger Collaborations, repurposing ten Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) stations as GRAND detection units. This setup provides a unique opportunity for coincident air-shower detection, enabling direct event-by-event comparison between GRAND@Auger and the well-established Pierre Auger detectors. Such comparisons allow for a detailed assessment of the detection principle and reconstruction capabilities of GRAND. In this contribution, we present an overview of the commissioning and preliminary results of GRAND@Auger, including the measurement of the Galactic background noise and the detection of the first self-triggered candidate event in coincidence with the Pierre Auger Observatory. Both results underscore the role of GRAND@Auger in advancing the GRAND project and refining the techniques required for large-scale radio detection of ultra-high-energy particles.</description>

      <title>Probing Axions via Spectroscopic Measurements of S-stars at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions, encompassing both QCD axions and axion-like particles, can generate loop-induced quadratic couplings to electromagnetic field strength tensors, resulting in oscillatory shifts of the fine-structure constant. Near a Kerr black hole, an axion field with a Compton wavelength comparable to the event horizon can exponentially grow through the superradiance mechanism, potentially reaching a maximum amplitude near the decay constant, provided this scale is below approximately $10^{16}$ GeV. The saturated axion cloud formed around the black hole induces characteristic oscillations in the fine-structure constant, with a period of $10$-$40$ minutes determined by the axion mass, and a spatial profile governed by the axion wavefunction and its coupling strength. At lower axion masses, axion dark matter can form a soliton-like core characterized by a nearly constant amplitude, extending measurable variations of the fine-structure constant to greater distances. Precise spectroscopic measurements of S-stars orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^*$ provide a powerful probe of these predictions, potentially excluding substantial regions of parameter space for quadratic scalar couplings to photons, owing to the high boson density near the Galactic Center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hyperonic equation of state within the non-linear derivative model that incorporates a momentum dependence on the interactions, with a special emphasis on properly establishing the conditions for hyperon appearance in neutron star matter. We demonstrate that hyperons can appear at finite momentum, forming a so-called ``moat" region, even when they are absent at lower momenta. Our study shows that this phenomenon significantly alters the composition and equation of state of hyperonic matter as compared to the cases when it is disregarded, highlighting the importance of accurately treating the momentum dependence of the baryon fields in dense matter.</description>

      <title>A forecasting framework for galactic cosmic ray flux in space weather applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intensity and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by the 11-year solar cycle, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. Understanding this effect and its underlying physical mechanisms is essential for assessing radiation exposure and associated risks during space missions. Starting from a previously developed effective predictive model of solar modulation, validated using cosmic ray flux measurements from space-based detectors such as PAMELA and AMS-02, we build a generalizable forecasting strategy for the long-term evolution of cosmic ray fluxes. This strategy is based on identifying delayed cross-correlation relationships between solar proxies and the model's parameters. It integrates recent findings on time lags between cosmic ray fluxes and solar activity, and incorporates advanced time-series signal processing techniques. The framework not only performs well in reproducing observed data, but also shows strong potential for applications in space radiation monitoring and forecasting. By efficiently capturing the long-term variability of galactic cosmic rays, our approach contributes valuable insights for evaluating radiation risks, ultimately supporting safer and more effective space exploration.</description>

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical particles beyond the Standard Model, are considered as promising dark matter candidates. ALPs can convert into photons and vice versa in a magnetic field via the Primakoff effect, potentially generating detectable oscillation in $\gamma$-ray spectra. This study analyzes 16.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) on NGC 1275, the brightest galaxy in the Perseus cluster, to constrain the ALP parameter space. Our results improve the previous 95\% exclusion limits of the photon-ALP coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ by a factor of 2 in the ALP mass range of $4\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Moreover, we investigate the projected sensitivity of the future Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) on searching for ALPs. We find that (i) the expected sensitivity on the ALP-photon coupling can be stronger than that from the upcoming International Axion Observatory (IAXO) in the ALP mass range of $2\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 1\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the best sensitivity of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 7\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ at $m_{a}\sim 2\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}$; (ii) VLAST can extend the sensitivity of the ALP masses below $5\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$, where the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim 1.5\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ will be excluded; (iii) the entire parameter space of ALP accounting for TeV transparency can be fully tested. These results demonstrate that VLAST will offer an excellent opportunity for ALPs searches.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have a great potential for future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2, the planned high-energy extension of the IceCube observatory. IceCube-Gen2 will feature new optical sensors with multiple photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) designed to provide omnidirectional sensitivity. Neural networks excel at handling high-dimensional problems and can naturally incorporate the increased complexity of these new sensors. Additionally, their fast inference time makes them promising candidates for handling the high event rates expected from IceCube-Gen2.
  This contribution presents potential applications of neural networks in the IceCube-Gen2 in-ice optical array. First, we introduce a method to simulate the IceCube-Gen2 optical modules' photon acceptance using a NN that leverages the modules' inherent symmetries. Secondly, we present the status of neutrino NN-based reconstruction efforts, including the adaptation of a novel IceCube technique that combines normalizing flows with transformer NNs. Finally, we describe current progress in noise cleaning applications based on node classification with graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that has already shown promising results for the forthcoming low-energy extension, IceCube-Upgrade.</description>

      <title>Why Jet Power and Star Formation Are Uncorrelated in Active Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet luminosity from active galaxies and the rate of star formation have recently been found to be uncorrelated observationally. We show how to understand this in the context of a model in which powerful AGN jets enhance star formation for up to hundreds of millions of years while jet power decreases in time, followed by a longer phase in which star formation is suppressed but coupled to jet power increasing with time. We also highlight characteristic differences depending on environment richness in a way that is also compatible with the observed SEDs of high redshift radio galaxies. While the absence of a direct correlation between jet power and star formation rate emerges naturally, our framework allows us to also predict the environment richness, range of excitation and redshift values of radio AGN in the jet power-star formation rate plane.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter halo on transonic accretion flow around a galactic black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transonic accretion flow in the spacetime of a supermassive black hole (BH) coupled to an anisotropic dark matter fluid, as proposed by Cardoso {\it et al}. We essentially compare the accretion properties of the Cardoso BH with those of an isolated Schwarzschild BH. The Cardoso BH is described by the halo mass ($M_{\rm H}$) and its characteristic length scale ($a_0$). Various classes of accretion solution topologies (e.g., A and W-types) are obtained by solving the dynamical equations of the flow in a fully general relativistic framework. We find that the global accretion solutions in the identified solution topologies are substantially influenced by the halo parameters ($M_{\rm H}, a_0$) when the halo mass is high or the dark matter distribution is concentrated near the black hole. In this high compactness regime, different observational signatures of the accretion disc, like the spectral energy distribution (SED) and bolometric disc luminosity, are found to exhibit considerable deviations from the known results in the Schwarzschild BH model. Furthermore, we obtain shock-induced accretion solutions, where different shock properties, such as the shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$), flow mass density ($\rho$) compression, and electron temperature ($T_e$) compression across the shock front, are potentially altered from those in the Schwarzschild BH model when the halo compactness is high. Interestingly, the existing shock parameter space, defined by the flow specific angular momentum ($\lambda$) and energy ($E$), is largely reduced for higher halo compactness compared to that of the Schwarzschild BH. These unique features offer a possible valuable tool for characterizing the presence or absence of a dark matter halo around a galactic black hole.</description>

      <title>Spatial dependence of the break in the energy spectrum of cosmic rays in the new anisotropic diffusion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At present, there is no consensus on whether the spectral break in the cosmic-ray flux of all elements around 4 PeV is a general characteristic of the Milky Way or is determined by a combination of factors that significantly affect the energy position of the knee. We argue that considering the anisotropic propagation of cosmic rays within a realistically modeled Galactic magnetic field enables an accurate description of the spectral break without invoking a source-related cutoff energy, and naturally predicts a spatial dependence of this phenomenon. To demonstrate this, we constructed a 3D diffusion propagation model with a diffusion tensor within a two-component magnetic field and determined both the local cosmic-ray spectrum and the spectra for specific regions of the Milky Way. We found that the spectral break is well reproduced by the energy dependence of the diffusion tensor components and appears at different energies in various regions of the Galaxy due to the inclusion of the turbulent component of the magnetic field. Furthermore, the spectral slope is determined by the degree of anisotropy in cosmic-ray diffusion. The model is based on the calculation of the diffusion tensor components using the trajectory method and on the direct solution of the stationary diffusion equation with a fully anisotropic diffusion tensor that includes all nine components in the global Galactic coordinate system, accounting for off-diagonal terms arising from the projection of locally field-aligned diffusion. We calculated the integral flux of diffuse gamma rays in the inner and outer regions of the Galaxy based on the cosmic-ray proton and nuclei spectra obtained within our model, which features a spatially dependent position of the knee. The resulting spectral shape of the diffuse gamma-ray flux is consistent with experimental data from LHAASO and Fermi-LAT.</description>

      <title>On the Binary Nature of the Progenitor of SN2015ap: Insights from Its Light Curve and Spectral Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) display a wide range of photometric and spectroscopic behaviours, often reflecting complex progenitor evolution. SN~2015ap is a type Ib event located in the nearby galaxy IC~1776, previously modelled as powered by radioactive decay and possibly a magnetar engine. In this work, we revisit its multi-band photometry and spectroscopy, {gathering all publicly available observational data for this source}, to investigate the nature of its progenitor and power source. {We use an innovative time analysis method based on Gaussian Process, leveraging its ability to model both noise and periodic components in unevenly sampled data without requiring regular sampling.} We detect significant periodic modulations in the post-peak light curve, with a characteristic timescale of $\sim$8.4 days. These modulations are also seen in the $H_{\alpha}$ line velocity, suggesting a structured circumstellar medium (CSM) shaped by binary interaction. We model the light curve with semi-analytical prescriptions (MOSFiT), including CSM and central engine components, and derive an ejecta mass of $\sim$2.2--2.4~$M_\odot$, explosion energy of $\sim$3.4$\times$10$^{51}$~erg, and a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim$0.11~$M_\odot$. The colour evolution indicates an additional energy injection, consistent with either prolonged breakout or delayed central powering. While the data are compatible with a weak magnetar contribution, the overall evidence favours a binary progenitor system, with non-conservative mass transfer shaping the observed CSM. SN~2015ap thus adds to the growing sample of SESNe where binarity plays a central role in driving both the explosion and its observables.</description>

      <title>Are FRBs emitted from rotating magnetospheres? Searching for periodicity in polarized bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the potential sources of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is a rotating magnetosphere of a compact object, as suggested by the similarities in the polarization properties of FRBs and radio pulsars. Attempts to measure an underlying period in the times of arrival of repeating FRBs have nevertheless been unsuccessful. To explain this lack of observed periodicity, it is often suggested that the line of sight towards the source must be sampling active parts of the emitting magnetosphere throughout the rotation of the compact object, i.e. has a large duty cycle, as can be the case in a neutron star with near-aligned magnetic and rotation axes. This may lead to apparently aperiodic bursts, however the polarization angle of the bursts should be tied to the rotational phase from which they occur. This is true for radio pulsars. We therefore propose a new test to identify a possible stable rotation period under the assumptions above, based on a periodogram of the measured polarization angle timeseries for repeating FRBs. We show that this test is highly sensitive when the duty cycle is large, where standard time-of-arrival periodicity searches fail. Therefore, we can directly test the hypothesis of repeating FRBs of magnetospheric origin with a stable rotation period. Both positive and negative results of the test applied to FRB data will provide important information.</description>

      <title>On the difficulty of capturing the distribution function of neutrinos in neutron star merger simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about nuclear physics. In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help us elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about the properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of neutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions for these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of neutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\nu$ for the number of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing neutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\nu)$. Recent simulations focused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve neutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\nu$ over momentum space, preventing direct calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an attractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos. Their current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\nu$: in our most recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst cases, estimates of $f_\nu$ to jump from $f_\nu=0$ to $f_\nu\sim 10^5$. While this is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos has been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid direct calculations of $f_\nu$. We are however reaching a level of modeling at which this problem can no longer be ignored. Here, we discuss the relatively simple origin of this issue. We then show that very rough estimates of $f_\nu$ can in theory be obtained in merger simulations, but that they will require a combination of unintuitive weighting schemes for Monte Carlo packets and smoothing of the neutrino distribution at coarser resolution than what the merger simulation uses.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $\gamma$-parameter for the vacuum solution of Cotton gravity with geodesics and shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced extension of General Relativity dubbed as Cotton gravity (CG), based on the use of the Cotton tensor, to estimate the size of a new constant $\gamma$ appearing within a spherically symmetric, vacuum solution of the theory. Taking into account its non-asymptotically flat character, we use the inferred size of the central brightness depression of the supermassive object at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy (Sgr A*) by the Event Horizon Telescope to constrain at $2\sigma$ the CG parameter as $\gamma M \approx 3.5 \times 10^{-12}$. We study the potential observational consequences from the smallness of such a value using exact and numerical expressions for the deflection angle, optical images from optically and geometrically thin accretion disks, isoradials, and instability scales (Lyapunov index) of nearly bound geodesics associated to photon rings. Our results point towards the impossibility to distinguish between these two geometries using current and foreseeable techniques in the field of interferometric detection of optical sources.</description>

      <title>Near-Horizon Polarization as a Diagnostic of Black Hole Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in imaging supermassive black holes is disentangling gravitational effects from plasma physics in order to accurately determine spacetime properties, particularly black hole spin. In this Letter, we present a fully covariant and rigorous analysis of the synchrotron emission from accreting plasma in the equatorial plane in the stationary, axisymmetric, high-conductivity regime, and identify--for the first time--a distinctive near-horizon polarization pattern that remains robust across different flow structures. This pattern arises from strong frame dragging near the event horizon, which induces a degeneracy among plasma flow and magnetic field configurations, yielding a polarization signature determined solely by the spacetime geometry and the observer's inclination. The near-horizon polarization thus offers a clean and precise probe of black hole spin and other fundamental parameters. If future space-based millimeter VLBI observations can resolve synchrotron emission originating within approximately 1$\%$ of the event horizon radius in M87* or Sgr A*, this universal polarization pattern may become observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CubeSat technology is an emerging alternative to large-scale space telescopes due to its short development time and cost-effectiveness. MeVCube is a proposed CubeSat mission to study the least explored MeV gamma-ray sky, also known as the `MeV gap'. Besides being sensitive to a plethora of astrophysical phenomena, MeVCube can also be important in the hunt for dark matter. If dark matter is made up of evaporating primordial black holes, then it can produce photons in the sensitivity range of MeVCube. Besides, particle dark matter can also decay or annihilate to produce final state gamma-ray photons. We perform the first comprehensive study of dark matter discovery potential of a near-future MeVCube CubeSat mission. In all cases, we find that MeVCube will have much better discovery reach compared to existing limits in the parameter space. This may be an important step towards discovering dark matter through its non-gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Fermi acceleration with cold atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are deemed to be generated by a process known as ``Fermi acceleration", in which charged particles scatter against magnetic fluctuations in astrophysical plasmas. The process itself is however universal, has both classical and quantum formulations, and is at the basis of dynamical systems with interesting mathematical properties, such as the celebrated Fermi-Ulam model. Despite its effectiveness in accelerating particles, Fermi acceleration has so far eluded unambiguous verifications in laboratory settings. Here, we realize the first fully controllable Fermi accelerator by colliding ultracold atoms against engineered movable potential barriers. We demonstrate that our Fermi accelerator, which is only 100 um in size, can produce ultracold atomic jets with velocities above half a meter per second. Adding dissipation, we also experimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra, which is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand, our work effectively opens the window to the study of high energy astrophysics with cold atoms, offering new capabilities for the understanding of phenomena such as diffusive acceleration at collisionless shocks. On the other, the performance of our Fermi accelerator is competitive with those of best-in-class accelerating methods used in quantum technology and quantum colliders, but with substantially simpler implementation and virtually no upper limit.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Reconstruction for Radio Detection of Inclined Air Showers in Three Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of the electric field produced by extensive air showers is essential for the radio-detection technique, as the key parameters of interest of the primary particles that generated the showers are the amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum, and energy fluence carried by the electric field at each receiving radio antenna. Conventional electric-field reconstruction methods primarily focus on antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this work, we introduce an analytic $\chi^2$ minimization method that is applicable to both two and three polarizations. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves standard deviations better than 4\% and 6\% for the estimation of the Hilbert peak envelope amplitude of the electric field and the energy fluence, respectively, with an antenna-response-dependent bias. Additionally, we have studied the dependence of the method with arrival direction showing that it has a good performance in the zenith range from 63$^\circ$ up to 80$^\circ$. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of the reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric-field estimation for inclined air showers.</description>
