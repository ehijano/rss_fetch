      <title>Ferrimagnetism induced by thermal vibrations in oxygen-deficient manganite heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-exchange most often leads to antiferromagnetim in transition-metal perovskite oxides, yet ferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism would be preferred for many applications, for example in data storage. While alloying, epitaxial strain and defects were shown to lead to ferromagnetism, engineering this magnetic order remains a challenge. We propose, based on density functional theory calculations, a novel route to defect-engineer ferrimagnetism, which is based on preferential displacements of oxygen vacancies due to finite temperature vibrations. This mechanism has an unusual temperature dependence, as it is absent at 0K, strengthens with increasing temperature before vanishing once oxygen vacancies disorder, giving it a unique experimentally detectable signature.</description>

      <title>The structure and migration of heavily irradiated grain boundaries and dislocations in Ni in the athermal limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microstructural evolution at and near pre-existing grain boundaries (GBs) and dislocations in materials under high radiation doses is still poorly understood. In this work, we use the creation relaxation algorithm (CRA) developed for atomistic modeling of high-dose irradiation in bulk materials to probe the athermal limit of saturation of GB and dislocation core regions under irradiation in FCC Ni. We find that, upon continuously subjecting a single dislocation or GB to Frenkel pair creation in the athermal limit, a local steady state disordered defect structure is reached with excess properties that fluctuate around constant values. Case studies are given for a straight screw dislocation which elongates into a helix under irradiation and several types of low and high angle GBs, which exhibit coupled responses such as absorption of extrinsic dislocations, roughening and migration. A positive correlation is found between initial GB energy and the local steady state GB energy under irradiation across a wide variety of GB types. Metastable GB structures with similar density in the defect core region but different initial configurations are found to converge to the same limiting structure under CRA. The mechanical responses of pristine and irradiated dislocations and GB structures are compared under an applied shear stress. Irradiated screw and edge dislocations are found to exhibit a hardening response, migrating at larger flow stresses than their pristine counterparts. Mobile GBs are found to exhibit softening or hardening responses depending on GB character. Although some GBs recover their initial pristine structures upon migration outside of the radiation zone, many GBs sustain different flow stresses corresponding to altered mobile core structures.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dimensionality on the Magnetocaloric Effect in Two-dimensional Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetocaloric materials, which exploit reversible temperature changes induced by magnetic field variations, are promising for advancing energy-efficient cooling technologies. The potential integration of two-dimensional materials into magnetocaloric systems represents an emerging opportunity to enhance the magnetocaloric cooling efficiency. In this study, we use atomistic spin dynamics simulations based on first-principles parameters to systematically evaluate how magnetocaloric properties transition from three-dimensional (3D) to two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials. We find that 2D features such as reduced Curie temperature, sharper magnetic transition, and higher magnetic susceptibility are beneficial for magnetocaloric applications, while the relatively higher lattice heat capacity in 2D can compromise achievable adiabatic temperature changes. We further propose GdSi$_2$ as a promising 2D magnetocaloric material near hydrogen liquefaction temperature. Our analysis offers valuable theoretical insights into the magnetocaloric effect in 2D ferromagnets and demonstrates that 2D ferromagnets hold promise for cooling and thermal management applications in compact and miniaturized nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Machine learning aided parameter analysis in Perovskite X-ray Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many factors in perovskite X-ray detectors, such as crystal lattice and carrier dynamics, determine the final device performance (e.g., sensitivity and detection limit). However, the relationship between these factors remains unknown due to the complexity of the material. In this study, we employ machine learning to reveal the relationship between 15 intrinsic properties of halide perovskite materials and their device performance. We construct a database of X-ray detectors for the training of machine learning. The results show that the band gap is mainly influenced by the atomic number of the B-site metal, and the lattice length parameter b has the greatest impact on the carrier mobility-lifetime product ({\mu}{\tau}). An X-ray detector (m-F-PEA)2PbI4 were generated in the experiment and it further verified the accuracy of our ML models. We suggest further study on random forest regression for X-ray detector applications.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarized light irradiated ferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$: the long-sought ideal Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between light and non-trivial energy band topology allows for the precise manipulation of topological quantum states, which has attracted intensive interest in condensed matter physics. In this work, using first-principles calculations, we studied the topological transition of ferromagnetic (FM) MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ upon irradiation with circularly polarized light (CPL). We revealed that the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ can be driven from an FM insulator to a Weyl semimetal with a minimum number of Weyl points, i.e., two Weyl points in systems without time-reversal symmetry. More importantly, in FM MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with out-of-plane easy magnetization axis, we found that the band dispersion of the WP evolves from Type-II to Type-III and finally to Type-I when the light intensity increases. Moreover, we show that the profile of the characteristic Fermi arc of Weyl semimetal phase is sensitive to changes in light intensity, which enables efficient manipulation of the Fermi arc length of FM MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ in experiments. In addition, for FM MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with in-plane easy magnetization axis, the system becomes a type I Weyl semimetal under CPL irradiation. With controllable band dispersion, length of Fermi arc, and minimum number of WPs, our results indicate that CPL-irradiated FM MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is an ideal platform to study novel transport phenomena in Weyl semimetals with distinct band dispersion.</description>

      <title>Influence of Ga-Ge Doping on the Structural and Electrical Properties of Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolytes For Li ion Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to replace the conventional liquid electrolytes by solid electrolytes, high room temperature ionic conductivity is required. To achieve such high ionic conductivity, the series Li7-3xGaxLa3Zr1.9Ge0.1O12 was prepared by solid-state reaction method. The content of Ge was kept constant at 0.10 a.p.f.u, and the Ga has been varied from 0 to 0.40 a.p.f.u. The conducting cubic phase was identified using X-ray diffraction study, whereas the physical and structural studies were perfomed using density measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, respectively. Electrical conductivity results reveal that the 0.20 Ga ceramic sample possessed the highest room temperature Li ion conductivity of 5.09 x 10-4 S/cm and minimum activation energy of 0.25 eV. Predominant ionic conduction in 0.20 Ga ceramic sample was confirmed by the DC polarization method. The high room temperature ionic conductivity makes the 0.20 Ga ceramic sample a suitable candidate as a solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLIBs).</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Characterization of Thermoelectric Performance in Copper-Based Chalcogenide CsCu$_3$S$_2$: Unveiling the role of Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental understanding of anharmonic lattice dynamics and heat conductance physics in crystalline compounds is critical for the development of thermoelectric energy conversion devices. Herein, we thoroughly investigate the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in CsCu$_3$S$_2$ by coupling the self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory with the linearized Wigner transport equation (LWTE). We explicitly consider both phonon energy shifts and broadening arising from both cubic and quartic anharmonicities, as well as diagonal/non-diagonal terms of heat flux operators in thermal conductivity. Our findings show that the strong anharmonicity of CsCu$_3$S$_2$ primarily arises from the presence of $p$-$d$ anti-bonding hybridization between Cu and S atoms, coupled with the random oscillations of Cs atoms. Notably, the competition between phonon hardening described by the loop diagram and softening induced by the bubble diagram significantly influences particle-like propagation, predominantly reflected in group velocity and energy-conservation rule. Additionally, the electrical transport properties are determined by employing the precise momentum relaxation-time approximation (MRTA). At high temperatures, the thermoelectric performance of $p$-type CsCu$_3$S$_2$ reaches its optimum theoretical value of 0.94 along the in-plane direction based on advanced phonon renormalization theory. In striking contrast, the harmonic approximation theory significantly overestimates the thermoelectric efficiency at the same temperatures, rendering it an impractical expectation. Conversely, the first-order renormalization approach leads to a serious underestimation of the thermoelectric properties due to the over-correction of phonon energy. Our study not only reveals the pivotal role of anharmonic lattice dynamics in accurately assessing thermoelectric properties but also underscores the potential thermoelectric applications for novel copper-based chalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional higher-order saddle points induced flat bands in Co-based kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saddle point (van Hove singularity) exhibits a divergent density of states in 2D systems, leading to fascinating phenomena like strong correlations and unconventional superconductivity, yet it is seldom observed in 3D systems. In this work, we have found two types of 3D higher-order saddle points (HOSPs) in emerging 3D kagome metals, YbCo$_6$Ge$_6$ and MgCo$_6$Ge$_6$. Both HOSPs exhibit a singularity in their density of states, which is significantly enhanced compared to the ordinary saddle point. The HOSP near the Fermi energy generates a flat band extending a large area in the Brillouin zone, potentially amplifying the correlation effect and fostering electronic instabilities. Two types of HOSPs exhibit distinct robustness upon element substitution and lattice distortions in these kagome compounds. Our work paves the way for engineering exotic band structures, such as saddle points and flat bands, and exploring interesting phenomena in Co-based kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the prediction of stacking fault energy by combining ab initio calculations and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking fault energies (SFEs) are vital parameters for understanding the deformation mechanisms in metals and alloys, with prior knowledge of SFEs from ab initio calculations being crucial for alloy design. Machine learning (ML) algorithms employed in the present work demonstrate approximately 80 times acceleration in predicting generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE), which is otherwise computationally expensive to obtain directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, particularly for alloys. The features used to train the ML algorithms stem from the physics-based Friedel model, revealing a connection between the physics of d-electrons and the deformation behavior of transition metals and alloys. Predictions based on the ML model are consistent with experimental data. This model could aid in accelerating alloy design by offering a rapid method for screening materials based on stacking fault energies.</description>

      <title>Third Harmonic Enhancement Harnessing Photoexcitation Unveils New Nonlinearities in Zinc Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical phenomena are at the heart of various technological domains such as high-speed data transfer, optical logic applications, and emerging fields such as non-reciprocal optics and photonic time crystal design. However, conventional nonlinear materials exhibit inherent limitations in the post-fabrication tailoring of their nonlinear optical properties. Achieving real-time control over optical nonlinearities remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a method to switch third harmonic generation (THG), a commonly occurring nonlinear optical response. Third harmonic generation enhancements up to 50 times are demonstrated in zinc oxide films via the photoexcited state generation and tunable electric field enhancement. More interestingly, the enhanced third harmonic generation follows a quadratic scaling with incident power, as opposed to the conventional cubic scaling, which demonstrates a previously unreported mechanism of third harmonic generation. The THG can also be suppressed by modulating the optical losses in the film. This work shows that the photoexcitation of states can not only enhance nonlinearities, but can create new processes for third harmonic generation. Importantly, the proposed method enables real-time manipulation of the nonlinear response of a medium. The process is switchable and reversible, with the modulations occurring at picosecond timescale. Our study paves the way to boost or suppress the nonlinearities of solid-state media, enabling robust, switchable sources for nonlinear optical applications.</description>

      <title>Mapping reaction mechanism during overcharge of a LiNiO2/Graphite-silicon lithium-ion battery: a correlative operando approach by simultaneous gas analysis and synchrotron scattering techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li-ion battery degradation processes are multi-scale, heterogeneous, dynamic and involve multiple cell components through cross talk mechanisms. Correlated operando characterization capable of measuring several key parameters are needed to accelerate understanding on these complex degradation processes. In particular, degradation mechanisms during overcharge of LiNiO2/Graphite-Silicon is well known at the material level featuring O2 gas release and concomitant surface reconstruction of LiNiO2. However, there are still debates regarding the role of high voltage O1 phase formation on gas production and no information on the effect of produced gases on the cell components (anode or sensors), or effect of overcharge on electrode level behavior. In this work, we simultaneously measured the gas produced using operando mass spectrometry while spatially resolving nanostructure and lattice changes using operando micro SAXS/WAXS mapping during the formation and over charge of a LiNiO2/Gr-Si pouch cell. This new correlated operando characterization experiment allowed to (1) confirm the absence of O1 phase even with substantial gas produced at end of charge, (2) unveil the effect of gases on reference and negative electrodes, (3) show that overcharge increases in-plane reaction heterogeneities by creating local degraded spots lagging behind the ensemble electrochemistry. These findings will be important to optimize ageing of devices based on similar chemistries, in particular Ni-rich NMC, while showing the strength of correlated characterization leading to more efficient and robust information on complex mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Phases Transition Mechanism in the Growth of WS2 and MoS2 Layers: Ab Initio Data Driving Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and large-scale atomic simulation is crucial for understanding growth mechanism and precise synthesis control of crystals. However, it is beyond the capacities of both ab initio and classical molecular dynamics (MD). This study takes a feasible way by developing ab initio data to accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to explore the complex growth processes. It successfully simulated the growth of monolayer, bilayer MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ heterostructures under variable conditions. Importantly, a SMMS (M is Mo/W atom) is disclosed as a new 2D structure with high stability during the growth. The two-step vapor-deposition can be regarded as the alternating between MS$_2$ and SMMS structures. Besides, the intermediate SMMS structure easy forms alloys can result in production of Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloy. Furthermore, metallic SMMS is an ideal self-intercalating electrode for transition metal dichalcogenides based FET. This research provides a mode that ab initio data driving MLIPs to efficient and accurate atomic growth simulation and design of materials.</description>

      <title>MatterSim: A Deep Learning Atomistic Model Across Elements, Temperatures and Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and fast prediction of materials properties is central to the digital transformation of materials design. However, the vast design space and diverse operating conditions pose significant challenges for accurately modeling arbitrary material candidates and forecasting their properties. We present MatterSim, a deep learning model actively learned from large-scale first-principles computations, for efficient atomistic simulations at first-principles level and accurate prediction of broad material properties across the periodic table, spanning temperatures from 0 to 5000 K and pressures up to 1000 GPa. Out-of-the-box, the model serves as a machine learning force field, and shows remarkable capabilities not only in predicting ground-state material structures and energetics, but also in simulating their behavior under realistic temperatures and pressures, signifying an up to ten-fold enhancement in precision compared to the prior best-in-class. This enables MatterSim to compute materials' lattice dynamics, mechanical and thermodynamic properties, and beyond, to an accuracy comparable with first-principles methods. Specifically, MatterSim predicts Gibbs free energies for a wide range of inorganic solids with near-first-principles accuracy and achieves a 15 meV/atom resolution for temperatures up to 1000K compared with experiments. This opens an opportunity to predict experimental phase diagrams of materials at minimal computational cost. Moreover, MatterSim also serves as a platform for continuous learning and customization by integrating domain-specific data. The model can be fine-tuned for atomistic simulations at a desired level of theory or for direct structure-to-property predictions, achieving high data efficiency with a reduction in data requirements by up to 97%.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution of local elastic moduli in nanocrystalline metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastoplastic properties of nanocrystalline metals are non-uniform on the scale of the grain size, and this non-uniformity affects macroscopic quantities as, in these systems, a significant part of the material is at or adjacent to a grain boundary.
  We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the spatial distributions of local elastic moduli in nano-grained pure metals and analyze their dependence on grain size.
  Calculations are performed for copper and tantalum with grain sizes ranging from 5-20nm. Shear modulus distributions for grain and grain-boundary atoms were calculated. It is shown that the non-crystalline grain boundary has a wide shear-modulus distribution, which is grain-size independent, while grains have a peaked distribution, which becomes sharper with increasing grain size. Average elastic moduli of the bulk, grains, and grain boundary are calculated as a function of grain size. The atomistic simulations show that the reduction of total elastic moduli with decreasing grain size is mainly due to a resulting larger grain-boundary atoms fraction, and that the total elastic moduli can be approximated by a simple weighted average of larger grains elastic moduli and a lower grain-boundary elastic moduli.</description>

Abstract: We perform first-principles density functional calculations to elucidate structural, electronic and magnetic properties at the interface of \ce{(0001)Cr2O3-(111)Pt} bilayers. This investigation is motivated by the fact that, despite the promise of \ce{Cr2O3-Pt} heterostructures in a variety of antiferromagnetic spintronic applications, many key structural, electronic, and magnetic properties at the \ce{Cr2O3-Pt} interface are poorly understood. We first analyze all inequivalent lateral interface alignments to determine the lowest energy interfacial structure. For all lateral alignments including the lowest-energy one, we observe an accumulation of electrons at the interface between \ce{Cr2O3} and Pt. We find an unexpected reversal of the magnetic moments of the interface Cr ions in the presence of Pt compared to surface Cr moments in vacuum-terminated \ce{(0001)Cr2O3}. We also find that the heterostructure exhibits a magnetic proximity effect in the first three Pt layers at the interface with \ce{Cr2O3}, providing a mechanism by which the anomalous Hall effect can occur in \ce{(0001)Cr2O3-(111)Pt} bilayers. Our results provide the basis for a more nuanced interpretation of magnetotransport experiments on \ce{(0001)Cr2O3-(111)Pt} bilayers and should inform future development of improved antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on the \ce{Cr2O3-Pt} material system.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice-coupled helical magnetic order in breathing pyrochlore magnets, CuAlCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ and CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report low-temperature powder X-ray and neutron diffraction studies on breathing pyrochlore magnets Cu$M$Cr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ ($M$ = Al, Ga), which undergo a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm N} \approx$ 21 and 31 K for {$M$ = Al and Ga, respectively. X-ray diffraction reveals that the magnetic transition accompanies a structural transition from cubic $F{\overline 4}3m$ to polar orthorhombic $Imm2$ symmetry for both the compounds, with larger distortion observed for $M$ = Ga at low temperatures. Neutron diffraction reveals incommensurate magnetic modulation ${\mathbf Q} = (q_{\rm IC}, 0.5, 0)$ in the orthorhombic setting, where $q_{\rm IC} \approx$ 0.39 and 0.31 for $M$ = Al and Ga, respectively. Our magnetic-structure analysis suggests cycloid-type magnetic order but not proper-screw type for both the compounds. We find strong correlation between the local spin configuration and Cr-Cr bond lengths, indicating that the spin-lattice coupling as well as the magnetic frustration play an important role in determining the ground state. Cu$M$Cr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ potentially offers a platform to explore magnetoelectric effects arising from the helimagnet driven electric polarity.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic phonons with Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a method for calculating anharmonic lattice dynamics, by building a surrogate model based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Due to the underlying Gaussian form of a GP, the model is infinitely differentiable. This allows us to train the model trained directly on forces (the derivative of PESs) reducing the evaluations required for a given accuracy. We can extend this differentiation to directly calculate second and third order force-constants using automatic differentiation (AD). For the five model materials we study, we find that the force-constants are in close agreement with a standard finite-displacement approach. Our method appears to be linear scaling in the number of atoms at predicting both second and third-order (anharmonic) force-constants.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient, reliable and easy-to-use structure recognition of atomic environments is essential for the analysis of atomic scale computer simulations. In this work, we train two neuronal network (NN) architectures, namely PointNet and dynamic graph convolutional NN (DG-CNN) using different hyperparameters and training regimes to assess their performance in structure identification tasks of atomistic structure data. We show benchmarks on simple crystal structures, where we can compare against established methods. The approach is subsequently extended to structurally more complex SiO$_2$ phases. By making use of this structure recognition tool, we are able to achieve a deeper understanding of the crystallization process in amorphous SiO$_2$ under shock compression. Lastly, we show how the NN based structure identification workflows can be integrated into OVITO using its python interface.</description>

      <title>Discovery of T center-like quantum defects in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies would benefit from the development of high performance quantum defects acting as single-photon emitters or spin-photon interface. Finding such a quantum defect in silicon is especially appealing in view of its favorable spin bath and high processability. While some color centers in silicon have been emerging in quantum applications, there is still a need to search and develop new high performance quantum emitters. Searching a high-throughput computational database of more than 22,000 charged complex defects in silicon, we identify a series of defects formed by a group III element combined with carbon ((A-C)$\rm _{Si}$ with A=B,Al,Ga,In,Tl) and substituting on a silicon site. These defects are analogous structurally, electronically and chemically to the well-known T center in silicon ((C-C-H)$\rm_{Si}$) and their optical properties are mainly driven by an unpaired electron in a carbon $p$ orbital. They all emit in the telecom and some of these color centers show improved properties compared to the T center in terms of computed radiative lifetime or emission efficiency. We also show that the synthesis of hydrogenated T center-like defects followed by a dehydrogenation annealing step could be an efficient way of synthesis. All the T center-like defects show a higher symmetry than the T center making them easier to align with magnetic fields. Our work motivates further studies on the synthesis and control of this new family of quantum defects, and also demonstrates the use of high-throughput computational screening to detect new complex quantum defects.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced metallization and loss of surface magnetism in FeSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single crystalline FeSi samples with a conducting surface state (CSS) were studied under high pressure ($\textit{P}$) and magnetic field ($\textit{B}$) by means of electrical resistance ($\textit{R}$) measurements to explore how the bulk semiconducting state and the surface state are tuned by the application of pressure. We found that the energy gap ($\Delta$) associated with the semiconducting bulk phase begins to close abruptly at a critical pressure ($P_{cr}$) of ~10 GPa and the bulk material becomes metallic with no obvious sign of any emergent phases or non-Fermi liquid behavior in $\textit{R}$($\textit{T}$) in the neighborhood of $P_{cr}$ above 3 K. Moreover, the metallic phase appears to remain at near-ambient pressure upon release of the pressure. Interestingly, the hysteresis in the $\textit{R}$($\textit{T}$) curve associated with the magnetically ordered CSS decreases with pressure and vanishes at $P_{cr}$, while the slope of the $\textit{R}$($\textit{B}$) curve, d$\textit{R}$/d$\textit{B}$, which has a negative value for $\textit{P}$ &lt; $P_{cr}$, decreases in magnitude with $\textit{P}$ and changes sign at $P_{cr}$. Thus, the CSS and the corresponding two-dimensional magnetic order collapse at $P_{cr}$ where the energy gap $\Delta$ of the bulk material starts to close abruptly, revealing the connection between the CSS and the semiconducting bulk state in FeSi.</description>

      <title>Observation of an unconventional giant negative exchange bias effect in La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.85}$Nb$_{0.15}$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find an unconventional giant negative exchange bias (EB) of $H_{\rm EB}$ = --14.1~kOe at 2~K (cooling field of 50~kOe) in the cluster spin-glass (CSG) La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.85}$Nb$_{0.15}$O$_3$ perovsikte cobaltites. The magnetic memory effect, aging measurements, and nonlineraity in specific heat capacity reveal the glassy magnetic state at low temperatures. Further, the detailed analysis of {\it ac-}magnetic susceptibility confirms the glassy state below $\sim$58~K and the obtained characteristic spin-relaxation time-scale of $\tau_0$ = 8.4$\times$10$^{-10}$~s indicates the presence of CSG. Moreover, the analysis of magnetic training effect using the classical EB relaxation model reveals that the frozen spins relax slowly as compared to the rotatable spins at the interface of antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic (AFM/FM) regions in CSG. Interestingly, the dependence of EB parameters is found to be unconventional for cooling field $&gt;$50~kOe as the $H\rm_{EB}$ and $M\rm_{EB}$ show decreasing trend instead of expected saturation at higher fields. This unusual nature emerges due to large negative values of intrinsic interface exchange coupling ($J_i$), i.e., --10.24$\pm$0.22~meV and --12.55$\pm$0.49~meV for the measuring fields of $\pm$50~kOe and $\pm$90~kOe, respectively, whereas the number of spins in the FM cluster ($N_{\rm FM}$) are found to be small in the range of 2.4--3.1. These obtained values of $J_i $ and $N_{\rm FM}$ indicate the dominant AFM interactions and the presence of FM clusters in the AFM matrix, respectively, which correlate well with the observed unconventional behavior of giant negative exchange bias in the present sample.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Crystal Thermal Hall Effect in Insulating Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that magnetic insulators with a collinear and compensated order can exhibit a thermal Hall effect even at zero magnetic field if they have altermagnetic symmetries. We predict a finite thermal Hall conductivity vector $\boldsymbol{\kappa}_\text{H}$ for a rutile-inspired effective spin model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Within the linear spin-wave theory, we identify two magnon branches that carry identical Berry curvature and give rise to a finite $\boldsymbol{\kappa}_\text{H}$, which can be controlled by the N\'eel vector orientation and by strain. The thermal Hall response is further complemented with a spin Nernst response to contrast spin and heat transport in altermagnetic insulators with those in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Our results establish the crystal thermal Hall effect of magnons and we discuss material candidates for experimental realization, such as MnF$_2$, CoF$_2$, and NiF$_2$.</description>

      <title>Understanding solid nitrogen through machine learning simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a fast, transferable, general purpose, machine-learning interatomic potential suitable for large-scale simulations of $N_2$. The potential is trained only on high quality quantum chemical molecule-molecule interactions, no condensed phase information is used. The potential reproduces the experimental phase diagram including the melt curve and the molecular solid phases of nitrogen up to 10 GPa. This demonstrates that many-molecule interactions are unnecessary to explain the condensed phases of $N_2$. With increased pressure, transitions are observed from cubic ($\alpha-N_2$), which optimises quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, through tetragonal ($\gamma-N_2$) which allows more efficient packing, through to monoclinic ($\lambda-N_2$) which packs still more efficiently. On heating, we obtain the hcp 3D rotor phase ($\beta-N_2$) and, at pressure, the cubic $\delta-N_2$ phase which contains both 3D and 2D rotors, tetragonal $\delta^\star-N_2$ phase with 2D rotors and the rhombohedral $\epsilon-N_2$. Molecular dynamics demonstrates where these phases are indeed rotors, rather than frustrated order. The model does not support the existence of the wide range of bondlengths reported for the complex $\iota-N_2$ phase. The thermodynamic transitions involve both shifts of molecular centres and rotations of molecules. We simulate these phase transitions between finding that the onset of rotation is rapid whereas motion of molecular centres is inhibited and the cause of the observed sluggishness of transitions. Routine density functional theory calculations give a similar picture to the potential.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>

Abstract: Cavity quantum materials combine the rich many-body physics of condensed matter systems with strong coupling to the surrounding electromagnetic field, which presents both novel prospects and intricate challenges. One is often interested in the properties of one specific aspect of the material, e.g. the electronic many-body dynamics, subject to a structured bath of phononic and photonic modes. Open quantum systems featuring non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) but their usage of the system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to reach a consistent and rigorous description of open many-body systems and their quantum dynamics. We demonstrate first the strength and limitations of this stacked hierarchy for superradiant emission and spin-squeezing of established quantum optical models before presenting its full potential for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we explicitly simulate the impact of charge noise on the dynamic of the Fermi-Hubbard model subject to a structured bath comprising cavity and vibro-phononic environment. Strong optical coupling not only modifies the dynamic of the many-body system but serves furthermore as measurement channel providing information about the correlated motion imprinted by charge noise. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>

Abstract: To accelerate the process of materials design, materials science has increasingly used data driven techniques to extract information from collected data. Specially, machine learning (ML) algorithms, which span the ML discipline, have demonstrated ability to predict various properties of materials with the level of accuracy similar to explicit calculation of quantum mechanical theories, but with significantly reduced run time and computational resources. Within ML, graph neural networks have emerged as an important algorithm within the field of machine learning, since they are capable of predicting accurately a wide range of important physical, chemical and electronic properties due to their higher learning ability based on the graph representation of material and molecular descriptors through the aggregation of information embedded within the graph. In parallel with the development of state of the art classical machine learning applications, the fusion of quantum computing and machine learning have created a new paradigm where classical machine learning model can be augmented with quantum layers which are able to encode high dimensional data more efficiently. Leveraging the structure of existing algorithms, we developed a unique and novel gradient free hybrid quantum classical convoluted graph neural network (HyQCGNN) to predict formation energies of perovskite materials. The performance of our hybrid statistical model is competitive with the results obtained purely from a classical convoluted graph neural network, and other classical machine learning algorithms, such as XGBoost. Consequently, our study suggests a new pathway to explore how quantum feature encoding and parametric quantum circuits can yield drastic improvements of complex ML algorithm like graph neural network.</description>

      <title>DFT-Assisted Investigation of the Electric Field and Charge Density Distribution of Pristine and Defective 2D WSe$_2$ by Differential Phase Contrast Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most properties of solid materials are defined by their internal electric field and charge density distributions which so far are difficult to measure with high spatial resolution. Especially for 2D materials, the atomic electric fields influence the optoelectronic properties. In this study, the atomic-scale electric field and charge density distribution of WSe$_2$ bi- and trilayers are revealed by using an emerging microscopy technique, differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). For pristine material, a higher positive charge density located at the selenium atomic columns compared to the tungsten atomic columns is obtained and tentatively explained by a coherent scattering effect. Furthermore, the change in the electric field distribution induced by a missing selenium atomic column is investigated. A characteristic electric field distribution in the vicinity of the defect with locally reduced magnitudes compared to the pristine lattice is observed. This effect is accompanied by a considerable inward relaxation of the surrounding lattice, which according to first principles DFT calculation is fully compatible with a missing column of Se atoms. This shows that DPC imaging, as an electric field sensitive technique, provides additional and remarkable information to the otherwise only structural analysis obtained with conventional STEM imaging.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Instability in Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By systematic theoretical calculations, we have revealed an excitonic insulator (EI) in a van der Waals (vdW) layered compound Ta2Pd3Te5. The interlayer binding energy in the vdW layered compound is 19.6 meV/$\unicode{x212B}$$^2$. The computed phonon spectrum suggests that the monolayer is dynamically stable without lattice distortion. The monolayer can be obtained by exfoliation or molecular-beam epitaxy. First-principles calculations show that the monolayer is a nearly zero-gap semiconductor with the modified Becke-Johnson functional. Due to the like symmetry of the band-edge states, the 2D polarization $\alpha_{2D}$ would be finite as the band gap goes to zero, allowing for the EI state in the compound. Using the first-principles many-body perturbation theory, the $GW$-BSE calculation reveals that the exciton binding energy $E_b$ is larger than the single-particle band gap $E_g$, indicating the excitonic instability. Our findings suggest that the Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator without structural distortion.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets (AM) is a recently discovered class of collinear magnets that share some properties (anomalous transport, etc) with ferromagnets, some (zero net magnetization) with antiferromagnets, while also exhibiting unique properties (spin-splitting of electronic bands and resulting spin-splitter current). Since the moment compensation in AM is driven by symmetry, it must be possible to identify them by analyzing the crystal structure directly, without computing the electronic structure. Given the significant potential of AM for spintronics, it is very useful to have a tool for such an analysis. This work presents an open-access code implementing such a direct check.</description>

      <title>Effect of the atomic structure of complexions on the active disconnection mode during shear-coupled grain boundary motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The migration of grain boundaries leads to grain growth in polycrystals and is one mechanism of grain-boundary-mediated plasticity, especially in nanocrystalline metals. This migration is due to the movement of dislocation-like defects, called disconnections, which couple to externally applied shear stresses. While this has been studied in detail in recent years, the active disconnection mode was typically associated with specific macroscopic grain boundary parameters. We know, however, that varying microscopic degrees of freedom can lead to different atomic structures without changing the macroscopic parameters. These structures can transition into each other and are called complexions. Here, we investigate $[11\overline{1}]$ symmetric tilt boundaries in fcc metals, where two complexions -- dubbed domino and pearl -- were observed before. We compare these two complexions for two different misorientations: In $\Sigma19$b $[11\overline{1}]$ $(178)$ boundaries, both complexions exhibit the same disconnection mode. The critical stress for nucleation and propagation of disconnections is nevertheless different for domino and pearl. At low temperatures, the Peierls-like barrier for disconnection propagation dominates, while at higher temperatures the nucleation is the limiting factor. For $\Sigma$7 $[11\overline{1}]$ $(145)$ boundaries, we observed a larger difference. The domino and pearl complexions migrate in different directions under the same boundary conditions. While both migration directions are possible crystallographically, an analysis of the complexions' structural motifs and the disconnection core structures reveals that the choice of disconnection mode and therefore migration direction is directly due to the atomic structure of the grain boundary.</description>

      <title>CatTSunami: Accelerating Transition State Energy Calculations with Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Direct access to transition state energies at low computational cost unlocks the possibility of accelerating catalyst discovery. We show that the top performing graph neural network potential trained on the OC20 dataset, a related but different task, is able to find transition states energetically similar (within 0.1 eV) to density functional theory (DFT) 91% of the time with a 28x speedup. This speaks to the generalizability of the models, having never been explicitly trained on reactions, the machine learned potential approximates the potential energy surface well enough to be performant for this auxiliary task. We introduce the Open Catalyst 2020 Nudged Elastic Band (OC20NEB) dataset, which is made of 932 DFT nudged elastic band calculations, to benchmark machine learned model performance on transition state energies. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we replicated a well-known, large reaction network with 61 intermediates and 174 dissociation reactions at DFT resolution (40 meV). In this case of dense NEB enumeration, we realize even more computational cost savings and used just 12 GPU days of compute, where DFT would have taken 52 GPU years, a 1500x speedup. Similar searches for complete reaction networks could become routine using the approach presented here. Finally, we replicated an ammonia synthesis activity volcano and systematically found lower energy configurations of the transition states and intermediates on six stepped unary surfaces. This scalable approach offers a more complete treatment of configurational space to improve and accelerate catalyst discovery.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification and Propagation in Atomistic Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers promising new approaches to tackle complex problems and has been increasingly adopted in chemical and materials sciences. Broadly speaking, ML models employ generic mathematical functions and attempt to learn essential physics and chemistry from a large amount of data. Consequently, because of the lack of physical or chemical principles in the functional form, the reliability of the predictions is oftentimes not guaranteed, particularly for data far out of distribution. It is critical to quantify the uncertainty in model predictions and understand how the uncertainty propagates to downstream chemical and materials applications. Herein, we review and categorize existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for atomistic ML under a united framework of probabilistic modeling with the aim of elucidating the similarities and differences between them. We also discuss performance metrics to evaluate the calibration, precision, accuracy, and efficiency of the UQ methods and techniques for model recalibration. In addition, we discuss uncertainty propagation (UP) in widely used simulation techniques in chemical and materials science, such as molecular dynamics and microkinetic modeling. We also provide remarks on the challenges and future opportunities of UQ and UP in atomistic ML.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical observations on the topological nature of strained III-V semiconductors. By $k \cdot p$ perturbation, it can be shown that the strain-engineered conduction band hosts a Kramers-Weyl node at the $\Gamma$ point. It is theoretically shown a curated strain can create and then tune the sign of the topological charge. Furthermore, we outline experimental methods for both the realization and detection of strain-induced topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Geometry dependence of TLS noise and loss in a-SiC:H parallel plate capacitors for superconducting microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel plate capacitors (PPC) significantly reduce the size of superconducting microwave resonators, reducing the pixel pitch for arrays of single photon energy-resolving kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The frequency noise of KIDs is typically limited by tunneling Two-Level Systems (TLS), which originate from lattice defects in the dielectric materials required for PPCs. How the frequency noise level depends on the PPC's dimensions has not been experimentally addressed. We measure the frequency noise of 56 resonators with a-SiC:H PPCs, which cover a factor 44 in PPC area and a factor 4 in dielectric thickness. To support the noise analysis, we measure the TLS-induced, power-dependent, intrinsic loss and temperature-dependent resonance frequency shift of the resonators. From the TLS models, we expect a geometry-independent microwave loss and resonance frequency shift, set by the TLS properties of the dielectric. However, we observe a thickness-dependent microwave loss and resonance frequency shift, explained by surface layers that limit the performance of PPC-based resonators. For a uniform dielectric, the frequency noise level should scale directly inversely with the PPC area and thickness. We observe that an increase in PPC size reduces the frequency noise, but the exact scaling is, in some cases, weaker than expected. Finally, we derive an engineering guideline for the design of KIDs based on PPC-based resonators.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry dictated topology in periodic gauge fields and realization in strained and twisted 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) of Hamiltonian dictates double degeneracy between a pair of superpartners (SPs) transformed by supercharge, except at zero energy where modes remain unpaired in many cases. Here we explore a SUSY of complete isospectrum between SPs -- with paired zero modes -- realized by 2D electrons in zero-flux periodic gauge fields, which can describe twisted or periodically strained 2D materials. We find their low-energy sector containing zero (or threshold) modes must be topologically non-trivial, by proving that Chern numbers of the two SPs have a finite difference dictated by the number of zero modes and energy dispersion in their vicinity. In $30^\circ$ twisted bilayer (double bilayer) transition metal dichalcogenides subject to periodic strain, we find one SP is topologically trivial in its lowest miniband, while the twin SP of identical dispersion has a Chern number of $1$ ($2$), in stark contrast to time-reversal partners that have to be simultaneously trivial or nontrivial. For systems whose physical Hamiltonian corresponds to the square root of a SUSY Hamiltonian, such as twisted or strained bilayer graphene, we reveal that topological properties of the two SUSY SPs are transferred respectively to the conduction and valence bands, including the contrasted topology in the low-energy sector and identical topology in the high-energy sector. This offers a unified perspective for understanding topological properties in many flat-band systems described by such square-root models. Both types of SUSY systems provide unique opportunities for exploring correlated and topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing of Antiferromagnetic Magnon Two-Mode Squeezed Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: N\'eel ordered antiferromagnets exhibit two-mode squeezing such that their ground state is a nonclassical superposition of magnon Fock states. Here we theoretically demonstrate that antiferromagnets can couple to spin qubits via direct dispersive interaction stemming from, e.g., interfacial exchange. We demonstrate that this kind of coupling induces a magnon number dependent level splitting of the excited state resulting in multiple system excitation energies. This series of level splittings manifests itself as nontrivial excitation peaks in qubit spectroscopy thereby revealing the underlying nonclassical magnon composition of the antiferromagnetic quantum state. By appropriately choosing the drive or excitation energy, the magnonic state can be controlled via the qubit, suggesting that Fock states of magnon pairs can be generated deterministically. This enables achieving states useful for quantum computing and quantum information science protocols.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of Disorder Driven Electronic Liquid Crystal Phases in Dirac Nodal Line Semimetal GdSbTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic liquid crystal (ELC) phases are spontaneous symmetry breaking states believed to arise from strong electron correlation in quantum materials such as cuprates and iron pnictides. Here, we report a direct observation of ELC phases in a Dirac nodal line (DNL) semimetal GdSbxTe2-x. Electronic nanostructures consisting of incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local nematic order are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As topological materials with symmetry protected Dirac or Weyl fermions are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such ELC phases are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave - orthorhombic structural transition. We further show how dopants can induce nematicity via quasiparticle scattering interference. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, topology and electron correlation.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Heating Induced Suppression of $d$-band Dominance in the Electronic Excitation Spectrum of Cuprum</title>

Abstract: The combination of isochoric heating of solids by free electron lasers (FEL) and in situ diagnostics by X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) allows for measurements of material properties at warm dense matter (WDM) conditions relevant for astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and material science. In the case of metals, the FEL beam pumps energy directly into electrons with the lattice structure of ions being nearly unaffected. This leads to a unique transient state that gives rise to a set of interesting physical effects, which can serve as a reliable testing platform for WDM theories. In this work, we present extensive linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) results for the electronic dynamic structure factor of isochorically heated copper with a face-centered cubic lattice. At ambient conditions, the plasmon is heavily damped due to the presence of $d$-band excitations, and its position is independent of the wavenumber. In contrast, the plasmon feature starts to dominate the excitation spectrum and has a Bohm-Gross type plasmon dispersion for temperatures $T \geq 4~{\rm eV}$, where the quasi-free electrons in the interstitial region are in the WDM regime. In addition, we analyze the thermal changes in the $d$-band excitations and outline the possibility to use future XRTS measurements of isochorically heated copper as a controlled testbed for WDM theories.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Modelling of High-Entropy Layered Anodes and Their Electrolyte Interface</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have attracted intense interest worldwide as they offer several routes to design materials with novel features wide-ranging applications. Unfortunately, at present, vdW heterostructures are restricted to a small number of stackable layers, due to the weak vdW forces holding adjacent layers together. In this work, we report on computational studies of a bulk vdW material consisting of alternating TiS2 and TiSe2 (TSS) vertically arranged layers as a potential candidate for anode applications. We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to explore the effect of high entropy on several electrochemically relevant properties of the bulk heterostructure (TSS-HS) by substituting Mo6+ and Al3+ at the transition metal site (Ti4+). We also study the solvation shell formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) using AIMD to determine Li-coordination. Based on the properties computed using DFT and AIMD we propose that high entropy TSS-HS (TSS-HE) might possess improved electrochemical performance over standard TSS-HS. Factors that could improve the performance of TSS-HE are 1) Less structural deformation, 2) Strong bonding (Metal-O), 3) Better electron mobility, 4) Higher theoretical specific capacity, 5) Wider operational voltage window, and 6) Faster Li-ion diffusion. Our observations suggests that 'high entropy' can be an effective strategy to design new anode materials for improving electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries.</description>
