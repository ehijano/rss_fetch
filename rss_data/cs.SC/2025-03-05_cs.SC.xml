      <title>PANTHER: Pluginizable Testing Environment for Network Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PANTHER, a modular framework for testing network protocols and formally verifying their specification. The framework incorporates a plugin architecture to enhance flexibility and extensibility for diverse testing scenarios, facilitate reproducible and scalable experiments leveraging Ivy and Shadow, and improve testing efficiency by enabling automated workflows through YAML-based configuration management. Its modular design validates complex protocol properties, adapts to dynamic behaviors, and facilitates seamless plugin integration for scalability. Moreover, the framework enables a stateful fuzzer plugin to enhance implementation robustness checks.</description>

      <title>LTL Verification of Memoryful Neural Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for verifying Memoryful Neural Multi-Agent Systems (MN-MAS) against full Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications. In MN-MAS, agents interact with a non-deterministic, partially observable environment. Examples of MN-MAS include multi-agent systems based on feed-forward and recurrent neural networks or state-space models. Different from previous approaches, we support the verification of both bounded and unbounded LTL specifications. We leverage well-established bounded model checking techniques, including lasso search and invariant synthesis, to reduce the verification problem to that of constraint solving. To solve these constraints, we develop efficient methods based on bound propagation, mixed-integer linear programming, and adaptive splitting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms in single and multi-agent environments from the Gymnasium and PettingZoo libraries, verifying unbounded specifications for the first time and improving the verification time for bounded specifications by an order of magnitude compared to the SoA.</description>

      <title>Projecting dynamical systems via a support bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a polynomial dynamical system, we study the problem of computing the minimal differential equation satisfied by a chosen coordinate (in other words, projecting the system on the coordinate). This problem can be viewed as a special case of the general elimination problem for systems of differential equations and appears in applications to modeling and control.
  We give a bound for the Newton polytope of such minimal equation and show that our bound is sharp in "more than half of the cases". We further use this bound to design an algorithm for computing the minimal equation following the evaluation-interpolation paradigm. We demonstrate that our implementation of the algorithm can tackle problems which are out of reach for the state-of-the-art software for differential elimination.</description>

      <title>What Kind of Morphisms Induces Covering Maps over a Real Closed Field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we show that a flat morphism of $k$-varieties ($\mathop{\mathrm{char}} k=0$) with locally constant geometric fibers becomes finite \'etale after reduction. When $k$ is a real closed field, we prove that such a morphism induces a covering map on the rational points. We further give a triviality result different from Hardt's and a new interpretation of the construction of cylindrical algebraic decomposition as applications.</description>
