      <title>Boundary spectral estimates for semiclassical Gevrey operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the spectral and resolvent estimates for semiclassical pseudodifferential operators with symbol of Gevrey-$s$ regularity, near the boundary of the range of the principal symbol. We prove that the boundary spectrum free region is of size ${\mathcal O}(h^{1-\frac{1}{s}})$ where the resolvent is at most fractional exponentially large in $h$, as the semiclassical parameter $h\to 0^+$. This is a natural Gevrey analogue of a result by N. Dencker, J. Sj{\"o}strand, and M. Zworski in the $C^{\infty}$ and analytic cases.</description>

      <title>Silent Orbits and Cancellations in the Wave Trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that the wave trace of a bounded and strictly convex planar domain may be arbitrarily smooth in a neighborhood of some point in the length spectrum. In other words, the Poisson relation, which asserts that the singular support of the wave trace is contained in the closure of $\pm$ the length spectrum, can almost be made into a strict inclusion. To do so, we construct large families of domains for which there exist multiple periodic billiard orbits having the same length but different Maslov indices. Using the microlocal Balian-Bloch-Zelditch parametrix for wave invariants developed in our previous paper, we solve a large system of equations for the boundary curvature jets, which leads to the required cancellations. We call such periodic orbits silent, since they are undetectable from the ostensibly audible wave trace. Such cancellations show that there are potential limitations in using the wave trace for inverse spectral problems and more fundamentally, that the Laplace spectrum and length spectrum are inherently different mathematical objects, at least insofar as the wave trace is concerned.</description>

      <title>Spectral Approximation for substitution systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study periodic approximations of aperiodic Schr\"odinger operators on lattices in Lie groups with dilation structure. The potentials arise through symbolic substitution systems that have been recently introduced in this setting. We characterize convergence of spectra of associated Schr\"odinger operators in the Hausdorff distance via properties of finite graphs. As a consequence, new examples of periodic approximations are obtained. We further prove that there are substitution systems that do not admit periodic approximations in higher dimensions, in contrast to the one-dimensional case. On the other hand, if the spectra converge, then we show that the rate of convergence is necessarily exponentially fast. These results are new even for substitutions over $\mathbb{Z}^d$.</description>

      <title>Uniform ergodic theorems for semigroup representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a bounded representation $T$ of a commutative semigroup $S$ on a Banach space and analyse the relation between three concepts: (i) properties of the unitary spectrum of $T$, which is defined in terms of semigroup characters on $S$; (ii) uniform mean ergodic properties of $T$; and (iii) quasi-compactness of $T$.
  We use our results to generalize the celebrated Niiro-Sawashima theorem to semigroup representations and, as a consequence, obtain the following: if a positive and bounded semigroup representation on a Banach lattice is uniformly mean ergodic and has finite-dimensional fixed space, then it is quasi-compact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper Behrndt, Holzmann, and Stenzel introduced a new class of two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with oblique transmissions along smooth curves. We extend most components of this analysis to the case of Lipschitz curves.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansion of the Eigenvalues of a Bathtub Potential with Quadratic Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalues of a one-dimensional semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator, where the potential consist of two quadratic ends (that is, looks like a harmonic oscillator at each infinite end), possibly with a flat region in the middle. Such a potential notably has a discontinuity in the second derivative. We derive an asymptotic expansion, valid either in the high energy regime or the semiclassical regime, with a leading order term given by the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition, and an asymptotic expansion consisting of negative powers of the leading order term, with coefficients that are oscillatory in the leading order term. We apply this expansion to study the results of the Gutzwiller Trace formula and the heat kernel asymptotic for this class of potentials, giving an idea into what results to expect for such trace formulas for non-smooth potentials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement bounds for single-excitation energy eigenstates of quantum oscillator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an analytic method for estimating the entanglement of the non-gaussian energy eigenstates of disordered harmonic oscillator systems. We invoke the explicit formulas of the eigenstates of the oscillator systems to establish bounds for their $\epsilon$-R\'enyi entanglement entropy $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. Our methods result in a logarithmically corrected area law for the entanglement of eigenstates, corresponding to one excitation, of the disordered harmonic oscillator systems.</description>
