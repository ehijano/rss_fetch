      <title>Social learning with complex contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical model that combines the concepts of complex contagion with payoff-biased imitation, to describe how social behaviors spread through a population. Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion -- where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. Our framework generalizes this process to incorporate complex contagion, which requires multiple exposures before an individual considers adopting a different behavior. We formulate this as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, the most widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, our social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner's Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria. The long-term outcome depends on the balance between the complexity of the contagion process and the strength of selection that biases imitation towards more successful types. Our analysis intercalates the fields of evolutionary game theory with complex contagions, and it provides a synthetic framework that describes more realistic forms of behavioral change in social systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay of Intrinsic Fluctuation and Complexity in Intracellular Calcium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>

      <title>Controller to eliminate the first harmonic in periodic signal with uncertain delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plant (system to be controlled) produces a periodic signal containing a broad spectrum of the Fourier harmonics. The first Fourier harmonic (sine-type signal) is assumed to be undesirable and should be removed by an external force, while other harmonics should be preserved. Because the measured plant data has an unknown amount of time delay and the sensitivity of the plant to external force is unknown, thus the amplitude and the phase of an anti-sine control force are unknown as well. We developed an adaptive controller described as a linear time-invariant system that can remove the first harmonic from the plant's output by constantly adjusting its parameters of control force. That type of controller was requested to further extend the capabilities of a newly developed high-speed large-area rotational scanning atomic force microscopy technique where the sample is rotated and a tilt angle between the normal of the sample surface and the axis of rotation produces the parasitic first Fourier harmonic which significantly limits the scanning area.</description>
