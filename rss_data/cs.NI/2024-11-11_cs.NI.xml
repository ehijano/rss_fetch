      <title>TraDE: Network and Traffic-aware Adaptive Scheduling for Microservices Under Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic architecture to microservices has enhanced flexibility in application design and its scalable execution. This approach often involves using a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform, which supports the deployment of microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we introduce a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE. This framework can adaptively redeploy microservice containers to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3\%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.4x while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36\% and showing robust adaptive capability under sustained workloads.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of MAC Protocols for Wireless Mesh Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless networking is encouraged by the constant enhancement of sensors' ability and wireless communication. To provide service quality support for multimedia viz. audio and video streams, the IEEE 802.11e MAC (Media Access Control) improves basic 802.11 MAC. IEEE 802.11 standard series such as IEEE 802.11a, b, g, n, p, and ac have been promoted and specified in the current communications and connection development. Each standard has functionality that matches the kind of applications for which the standard is intended. IEEE 802.11ac has better performance with fewer interferences and achieves gigabits per second capacity transfer rates. This paper discusses the comparative examination of the IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11p, and IEEE 802.11ac standards which increase accuracy and performance pertaining to the IEEE 802.11 standard. In this paper, we investigate the design requirements for numerous simultaneous peer-to-peer connections. Further, this study offers a systematic review and analysis of the MAC layer in WMN (Wireless Mesh Network) and also highlights their open research issues and challenges. Finally, this paper discusses various potential directions for future research in this area with an emphasis on their strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight QoS-Aware Resource Allocation Method for NR-V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, which includes Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), and Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) networks, is gaining significant attention due to the rise of connected and autonomous vehicles. V2X systems require diverse Quality of Service (QoS) provisions, with V2V communication demanding stricter latency and reliability compared to V2I. The 5G New Radio-V2X (NR-V2X) standard addresses these needs using multi-numerology Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), which allows for flexible allocation of radio resources. However, V2I and V2V users sharing the same radio resources leads to interference, necessitating efficient power and resource allocation. In this work, we propose a novel resource allocation and sharing algorithm for 5G-based V2X systems. Our approach first groups Resource Blocks (RBs) into Resource Chunks (RCs) and allocates them to V2I users using the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm. Power is then allocated to RCs to facilitate efficient resource sharing between V2I and V2V users through a bisection search method. Finally, the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to pair V2I and V2V users, maintaining low computational complexity while ensuring high performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed Gale-Shapley Resource Allocation with Gale-Shapley Sharing (GSRAGS) achieves competitive performance with lower complexity compared to existing works while effectively meeting the QoS demands of V2X communication systems.</description>

      <title>Joint Age and Coverage-Optimal Satellite Constellation Relaying in Cislunar Communications with Hybrid Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing lunar missions, a growing interest develops in designing data relay satellite constellations for cislunar communications, which is challenged by the constrained visibility and huge distance between the earth and moon in pursuit of establishing real-time communication links. In this work, therefore, we propose an age and coverage optimal relay satellite constellation for cislunar communication by considering the self-rotation of the earth as well as the orbital motion of the moon, which consists of hybrid Earth-Moon Libration 1/2 (EML1/L2) points Halo orbits, ordinary lunar orbits, and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites. In particular, by minimizing both the number of satellites and the average per-device Age of Information (AoI) while maximizing the coverage ratio of specific lunar surface regions, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and solved by using a well-designed Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed hybrid constellation significantly outperforms traditional Walker Star and Delta constellations in terms of both AoI and the coverage of communication.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Backed Closed-Loops for Energy-Aware and Open RAN-based Fixed Wireless Access Serving Rural Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet access in rural areas should be improved to support digital inclusion and 5G services. Due to the high deployment costs of fiber optics in these areas, Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) has become a preferable alternative. Additionally, the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) can facilitate the interoperability of FWA elements, allowing some FWA functions to be deployed at the edge cloud. However, deploying edge clouds in rural areas can increase network and energy costs. To address these challenges, we propose a closed-loop system assisted by a Digital Twin (DT) to automate energy-aware O-RAN based FWA resource management in rural areas. We consider the FWA and edge cloud as the Physical Twin (PT) and design a closed-loop that distributes radio resources to edge cloud instances for scheduling. We develop another closed-loop for intra-slice resource allocation to houses. We design an energy model that integrates radio resource allocation and formulate ultra-small and small-timescale optimizations for the PT to maximize slice requirement satisfaction while minimizing energy costs. We then design a reinforcement learning approach and successive convex approximation to address the formulated problems. We present a DT that replicates the PT by incorporating solution experiences into future states. The results show that our approach efficiently uses radio and energy resources.</description>

      <title>Renewable Energy Powered and Open RAN-based Architecture for 5G Fixed Wireless Access Provisioning in Rural Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high costs of optical fiber deployment in Low-Density and Rural Areas (LDRAs), 5G Fixed Wireless Access (5G FWA) recently emerged as an affordable solution. A widely adopted deployment scenario of 5G FWA includes edge cloud that supports computing services and Radio Access Network (RAN) functions. Such edge cloud requires network and energy resources for 5G FWA. This paper proposes renewable energy powered and Open RAN-based architecture for 5G FWA serving LDRAs using three-level closed-loops. Open RAN is a new 5G RAN architecture allowing Open Central Unit and Open Distributed Unit to be distributed in virtualized environment. The first closed-loop distributes radio resources to Open RAN instances and slices at the edge cloud. The second closed-loop allocates radio resources to houses. We design a new energy model that leverages renewable energy. We jointly optimize radio and energy resource allocation in closed-loop 3. We formulate ultra-small and small-time scale optimization problems that link closed-loops to maximize communication utility while minimizing energy costs. We propose reinforcement learning and successive convex approximation to solve the formulated problems. Then, we use solution data and continual learning to improve resource allocation on a large timescale. Our proposal satisfies 97.14% slice delay budget.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC) on Website Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern web traffic relies on 2048-bit RSA encryption to secure our data in transit. Rapid advances in Quantum Computing pose a grave challenge by allowing hackers to break this encryption in hours. In August of 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC) standards, including CRYSTALS-Kyber for general encryption and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+ for digital signatures. Despite this proactive approach, the slow adoption of encryption protocols remains a concern, leaving a significant portion of data vulnerable to interception. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the impact of NIST's Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithms on website response times, particularly focusing on SSL handshake time and total download time under varying network conditions. By assessing the performance of these algorithms, this research seeks to provide empirical evidence and a reusable framework for validating the efficacy of QSC in real-world scenarios. It was found that the QSC algorithms outperformed the classical algorithm under normal and congested network conditions. There was also found to be an improvement in the total download time for larger file sizes, and a better performance by QSC under higher latency and packet loss conditions. Therefore, this study recommends that websites switch to QSC when the standards are ratified. These insights are crucial for accelerating the adoption of QSC and ensuring the security of data in the face of quantum computing threats.</description>

      <title>Maximizing User Connectivity in AI-Enabled Multi-UAV Networks: A Distributed Strategy Generalized to Arbitrary User Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been extensively applied to Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) network (MUN) to effectively enable real-time adaptation to complex, time-varying environments. Nevertheless, most of the existing works assume a stationary user distribution (UD) or a dynamic one with predicted patterns. Such considerations may make the UD-specific strategies insufficient when a MUN is deployed in unknown environments. To this end, this paper investigates distributed user connectivity maximization problem in a MUN with generalization to arbitrary UDs. Specifically, the problem is first formulated into a time-coupled combinatorial nonlinear non-convex optimization with arbitrary underlying UDs. To make the optimization tractable, a multi-agent CNN-enhanced deep Q learning (MA-CDQL) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm integrates a ResNet-based CNN to the policy network to analyze the input UD in real time and obtain optimal decisions based on the extracted high-level UD features. To improve the learning efficiency and avoid local optimums, a heatmap algorithm is developed to transform the raw UD to a continuous density map. The map will be part of the true input to the policy network. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of UD heatmaps and the proposed algorithm in maximizing user connectivity as compared to K-means methods.</description>

      <title>A Wireless AI-Generated Content (AIGC) Provisioning Framework Empowered by Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the significant advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) and the proliferation of mobile devices, providing high-quality AIGC services via wireless networks is becoming the future direction. However, the primary challenges of AIGC services provisioning in wireless networks lie in unstable channels, limited bandwidth resources, and unevenly distributed computational resources. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication (SemCom)-empowered AIGC (SemAIGC) generation and transmission framework, where only semantic information of the content rather than all the binary bits should be generated and transmitted by using SemCom. Specifically, SemAIGC integrates diffusion models within the semantic encoder and decoder to design a workload-adjustable transceiver thereby allowing adjustment of computational resource utilization in edge and local. In addition, a Resource-aware wOrklOad Trade-off (ROOT) scheme is devised to intelligently make workload adaptation decisions for the transceiver, thus efficiently generating, transmitting, and fine-tuning content as per dynamic wireless channel conditions and service requirements. Simulations verify the superiority of our proposed SemAIGC framework in terms of latency and content quality compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>TwiNet: Connecting Real World Networks to their Digital Twins Through a Live Bidirectional Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wireless spectrum's increasing complexity poses challenges and opportunities, highlighting the necessity for real-time solutions and robust data processing capabilities. Digital Twin (DT), virtual replicas of physical systems, integrate real-time data to mirror their real-world counterparts, enabling precise monitoring and optimization. Incorporating DTs into wireless communication enhances predictive maintenance, resource allocation, and troubleshooting, thus bolstering network reliability. Our paper introduces TwiNet, enabling bidirectional, near-realtime links between real-world wireless spectrum scenarios and DT replicas. Utilizing the protocol, MQTT, we can achieve data transfer times with an average latency of 14 ms, suitable for real-time communication. This is confirmed by monitoring real-world traffic and mirroring it in real-time within the DT's wireless environment. We evaluate TwiNet's performance in two use cases: (i) assessing risky traffic configurations of UEs in a Safe Adaptive Data Rate (SADR) system, improving network performance by approximately 15% compared to original network selections; and (ii) deploying new CNNs in response to jammed pilots, achieving up to 97% accuracy training on artificial data and deploying a new model in as low as 2 minutes to counter persistent adversaries. TwiNet enables swift deployment and adaptation of DTs, addressing crucial challenges in modern wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Secured Smart Grid 2.0: Exploring Security Threats, Protection Models, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many nations are promoting the green transition in the energy sector to attain neutral carbon emissions by 2050. Smart Grid 2.0 (SG2) is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2's stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research.</description>

      <title>Towards the limits: Sensing Capability Measurement for ISAC Through Channel Encoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 6G technology offers a broader range of possibilities for communication systems to perform ubiquitous sensing tasks, including health monitoring, object recognition, and autonomous driving. Since even minor environmental changes can significantly degrade system performance, and conducting long-term posterior experimental evaluations in all scenarios is often infeasible, it is crucial to perform a priori performance assessments to design robust and reliable systems. In this paper, we consider a discrete ubiquitous sensing system where the sensing target has \(m\) different states \(W\), which can be characterized by \(n\)-dimensional independent features \(X^n\). This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the sensing systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities and more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).</description>
