      <title>DTInsight: A Tool for Explicit, Interactive, and Continuous Digital Twin Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With Digital Twin (DT) construction and evolution occurring over time, stakeholders require tools to understand the current characteristics and conceptual architecture of the system at any time. We introduce DTInsight, a systematic and automated tool and methodology for producing continuous reporting for DTs. DTInsight offers three key features: (a) an interactive conceptual architecture visualization of DTs; (b) generation of summaries of DT characteristics based on ontological data; and (c) integration of these outputs into a reporting page within a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Given a modeled description of the DT aligning to our DT Description Framework (DTDF), DTInsight enables up-to-date and detailed reports for enhanced stakeholder understanding.</description>

      <title>Architecting Distributed Quantum Computers: Design Insights from Resource Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable practically useful quantum computing, we require hundreds to thousands of logical qubits (collections of physical qubits with error correction). Current monolithic device architectures have scaling limits beyond few tens of logical qubits. To scale up, we require architectures that orchestrate several monolithic devices into a distributed quantum computing system. Currently, resource estimation, which is crucial for determining hardware needs and bottlenecks, focuses exclusively on monolithic systems. Our work fills this gap and answers key architectural design questions about distributed systems, including the impact of distribution on application resource needs, the organization of qubits across nodes and the requirements of entanglement distillation (quantum network). To answer these questions, we develop a novel resource estimation framework that models the key components of the distributed execution stack. We analyse the performance of practical quantum algorithms on various hardware configurations, spanning different qubit speeds, entanglement generation rates and distillation protocols. We show that distributed architectures have practically feasible resource requirements; for a node size of 45K qubits, distributed systems need on average 1.4X higher number of physical qubits and 4X higher execution time compared to monolithic architectures, but with more favourable hardware implementation prospects. Our insights on entanglement generation rates, node sizes and architecture have the potential to inform system designs in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Extending Cislunar Communication Network Reach Using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to enhance communication networks in the Cislunar space by leveraging Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). Using the ability of RIS to dynamically control electromagnetic waves, this paper tackles the challenges of signal attenuation, directivity, and divergence in Cislunar missions, primarily caused by immense distances and that Earth-based station transmitters do not always face the Moon. A new optimization problem is formulated, whose objective is to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for Earth-to-Moon communications. We derive a closed-form solution to the problem of determining the optimal RIS phase shift configuration based on the effective area of the RIS. Through extensive simulations, this paper demonstrates how optimal adjustments in RIS phase shifts can significantly enhance signal integrity, hinting at the substantial potential of RIS technology to revolutionize long-distance Cislunar communication.</description>

      <title>Local Learning Rules for Out-of-Equilibrium Physical Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>

      <title>$AutoGuardX$: A Comprehensive Cybersecurity Framework for Connected Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected systems in modern vehicles not only introduced a new era of convenience, automation, and connected vehicles but also elevated their exposure to sophisticated cyber threats. This is especially evident in US and Canada, where cyber-enabled auto theft has surged in recent years, revealing the limitations of existing security measures for connected vehicles. In response, this paper proposes $AutoGuardX$, a comprehensive cybersecurity framework designed specifically for connected vehicles. $AutoGuardX$ combines key elements from existing recognized standards for vehicle security, such as ISO/SAE 21434 and ISO 26262, with advanced technologies, including machine learning-based anomaly detection, IoT security protocols, and encrypted communication channels. The framework addresses major attack vectors like relay attacks, controller area network (CAN) bus intrusions, and vulnerabilities introduced by emerging technologies such as 5G and quantum computing. $AutoGuardX$ is extensively evaluated through security simulations across a mix of Sedans and SUVs from four major vehicle brands manufactured between 2019 and 2023. The results demonstrate the framework's adaptability, scalability, and practical effectiveness against existing and emerging threats.</description>
