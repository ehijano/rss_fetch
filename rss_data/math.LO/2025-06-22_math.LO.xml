      <title>Diamonds and Dominoes: Impossibility Results for Associative Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any class of Boolean algebras with an associative operator, if it contains the complex algebra of (P(N), U), its equational theory is undecidable. Equivalently, any associative normal modal logic valid over the frame (P(N), U) is undecidable. This settles a long-open question on the decidability of hyperboolean modal logic (Goranko and Vakarelov, 1999), and addresses several related problems.</description>

      <title>Coinductive well-foundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a coinductive version of the well-foundedness of N that is used in our proof within minimal logic of the constructive counterpart CLNP to the standard least number principle LNP. According to CLNP, an inhabited complemented subset of N has a least element if and only if it is downset located. The use of complemented subsets of N in the formulation of CLNP, instead of subsets of N, allows a positive approach to the subject that avoids negation. Generalising the coinductive well-foundedness of N, we define $\exists$-well-founded sets and we prove their fundamental properties.</description>

      <title>Proofs that Modify Proofs, 1/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a prelude and elaboration on Proofs that Modify Proofs. Here we present an ordinal analysis of a fragment of the $\mu$-calculus around the strength of parameter-free $\Pi^1_2$-comprehension using the same approach as that paper, interpreting functions on proofs as proofs in an expanded system. We build up the ordinal analysis in several stages, beginning by illustrating the method systems at the strength of paremeter-free $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension and full $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted Authority: A Formal Architecture for Truth-Promoting Autonomous Scientific Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential expansion of scientific literature has surpassed the epistemic processing capabilities of both human experts and current artificial intelligence systems. This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient integrity across dynamic scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Locality in Many-Valued Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-valued models generalise the structures from classical model theory by defining truth values for a model with an arbitrary algebra. Just as algebraic varieties provide semantics for many non-classical propositional logics, models defined over algebras in a variety provide the semantics for the corresponding non-classical predicate logics. In particular models defined over varieties of residuated lattices represent the model theory for first-order substructrual logics.
  In this paper we study the extent to which the classical locality theorems from Hanf and Gaifman hold true in the residuated lattice setting. We demonstrate that the answer is sensitive both to how locality is understood in the generalised context and the behaviour of the truth-defining algebra. In the case of Hanf's theorem, we will show that the theorem fails for the natural understanding of local neighbourhoods, but is recoverable in one special case for well-connected residuated lattices. For Gaifman's theorem, rather than consider Gaifman normal forms directly we focus on the main lemma of the theorem from textbook proofs. We prove that for a number of different understandings of locality, provided the algebra is well-behaved enough to express locality in its syntax, this main lemma can be recovered. In each case we will see that importance of an order-interpreting connective which creates a link between the modelling relation between models and formulas and the valuation function from formulas into the algebra.</description>

      <title>New Bounds for the Ideal Proof System in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove upper and lower bounds over fields of positive characteristics for several fragments of the Ideal Proof System (IPS), an algebraic proof system introduced by Grochow and Pitassi (J. ACM 2018). Our results extend the works of Forbes, Shpilka, Tzameret, and Wigderson (Theory of Computing 2021) and also of Govindasamy, Hakoniemi, and Tzameret (FOCS 2022). These works primarily focused on proof systems over fields of characteristic $0$, and we are able to extend these results to positive characteristic.
  The question of proving general IPS lower bounds over positive characteristic is motivated by the important question of proving $AC^{0}[p]$-Frege lower bounds. This connection was observed by Grochow and Pitassi (J. ACM 2018). Additional motivation comes from recent developments in algebraic complexity theory due to Forbes (CCC 2024) who showed how to extend previous lower bounds over characteristic $0$ to positive characteristic.
  In our work, we adapt the functional lower bound method of Forbes et al. (Theory of Computing 2021) to prove exponential-size lower bounds for various subsystems of IPS. Additionally, we derive upper bounds for the instances presented above. We show that they have efficient constant-depth IPS refutations. We also show that constant-depth IPS can efficiently refute a general class of instances, namely all symmetric instances, thereby further uncovering the strength of these algebraic proofs in positive characteristic.
  Notably, our lower bounds hold for fields of arbitrary characteristic but require the field size to be $n^{\omega(1)}$. In a concurrent work, Elbaz, Govindasamy, Lu, and Tzameret have shown lower bounds against restricted classes of IPS over finite fields of any size by considering different hard instances.</description>

      <title>The Proof Analysis Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atserias and M\"uller (JACM, 2020) proved that for every unsatisfiable CNF formula $\varphi$, the formula $\operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$, stating "$\varphi$ has small Resolution refutations", does not have subexponential-size Resolution refutations. Conversely, when $\varphi$ is satisfiable, Pudl\'ak (TCS, 2003) showed how to construct a polynomial-size Resolution refutation of $\operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$ given a satisfying assignment of $\varphi$. A question that remained open is: do all short Resolution refutations of $\operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$ explicitly leak a satisfying assignment of $\varphi$?
  We answer this question affirmatively by giving a polynomial-time algorithm that extracts a satisfying assignment for $\varphi$ given any short Resolution refutation of $\operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$. The algorithm follows from a new feasibly constructive proof of the Atserias-M\"uller lower bound, formalizable in Cook's theory $\mathsf{PV_1}$ of bounded arithmetic.
  Motivated by this, we introduce a computational problem concerning Resolution lower bounds: the Proof Analysis Problem (PAP). For a proof system $Q$, the Proof Analysis Problem for $Q$ asks, given a CNF formula $\varphi$ and a $Q$-proof of a Resolution lower bound for $\varphi$, encoded as $\neg \operatorname{Ref}(\varphi)$, whether $\varphi$ is satisfiable. In contrast to PAP for Resolution, we prove that PAP for Extended Frege (EF) is NP-complete.
  Our results yield new insights into proof complexity: (i) every proof system simulating EF is (weakly) automatable if and only if it is (weakly) automatable on formulas stating Resolution lower bounds; (ii) we provide Ref formulas exponentially hard for bounded-depth Frege systems; and (iii) for every strong enough theory of arithmetic $T$ we construct unsatisfiable CNF formulas exponentially hard for Resolution but for which $T$ cannot prove even a quadratic lower bound.</description>

      <title>A Note on Proper Relational Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we provide an algorithm for translating relational structures into "proper" relational structures, i.e., those such that there is no pair of worlds w and u such that w is accessible from u for every agent. In particular, our method of translation preserves many classical properties of relational structures, such as transitivity and the Euclidean property. As a result, this method of translation has many applications in the literature on Simplicial Semantics for modal logic, where the creation of proper canonical relational structures is a common step in proofs of completeness.</description>

Abstract: We explore the theory of illfounded and cyclic proofs for the propositional modal $\mu$-calculus. A fine analysis of provability for classical and intuitionistic modal logic provides a novel bridge between finitary, cyclic and illfounded conceptions of proof and re-enforces the importance of two normal form theorems for the logic: guardedness and disjunctiveness.</description>

      <title>Conjugating trivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A trivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ is an automorphism induced by the action of some function $\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$. In models of forcing axioms all automorphisms are trivial, and therefore two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have the same (modulo finite) cycle structure. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if there are neither first-order obstructions nor index obstructions for their conjugacy. This is equivalent to given trivial automorphisms being conugate in some forcing extension of the universe.
  To each automorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ we associate the first-order structure $\mathfrak{A}_\alpha=(\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin},\alpha)$ and compute the existential theories of these structures.
  These results are applied to resolve a question of Braga, Farah, and Vignati and prove that there are coarse metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that the isomorphism between their uniform Roe coronas is independent from $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>

      <title>Some results in non-monotonic proof-theoretic semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I explore the relationships between Prawitz's approach to non-monotonic proof-theoretic validity, which I call reducibility semantics, and some later proof-theoretic approaches, which I call standard base semantics and Sandqvist's base semantics respectively. I show that, if suitable conditions are met, reducibility semantics and standard base semantics are equivalent, and that, if Sandqvist's variant is complete over reducibility semantics, then also the inverse holds. Finally, notions of "point-wise" soundness and completeness (called base-soundness and base-completeness) are discussed against some known principles from the proof-theoretic literature, as well as against monotonic proof-theoretic semantics. Intuitionistic logic is proved not to be "point-wise" complete on any kind of non-monotonic proof-theoretic semantics. The way in which this result is proved, as well as the overall behaviour of "point-wise" soundness and completeness, is significantly different in the non-monotonic framework as compared to what happens in the monotonic one - where the notions at issue can be used too to prove the "point-wise" incompleteness of intuitionistic logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an alternative presentation of the ordinal notation at the strength of $\Pi^1_1-CA_0$ which allows the "uncountable" notation $\Omega$ to be interpreted "polymorphically" - that is, we allow the notation to be interpreted as different cardinals depending on their context. This gives us a way to represent functions on ordinals within our ordinal notation system. We then use this idea to present an ordinal notation system for a system a bit weaker than parameter-free $\Pi^1_2-CA_0$.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) hierarchy. This is a Spoiler--Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's hierarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). We actually show that $7$ pebbles and $7$ rounds suffice. In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (\emph{ibid.}), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $7$ variables and quantifier depth $7$.</description>

Abstract: We derive two finiteness properties as consequences of the geometrical non-degeneracy of an algebraic subvariety $W$ of a power of the multiplicative group, concerning the intersections of $W$ with translates of a subtorus $H$ of dimension greater than or equal to the codimension of $W$. The first one is that every translate of $H$ intersects $W$, unless $H$ is contained in one of finitely many proper subtori depending only on $W$. The second one is that every translate of $H$ by a torsion point intersects $W$, unless the translate is contained in one of finitely many proper algebraic subgroups, again depending only on $W$. We use methods from tropical geometry and equidistribution, as well as some very mild model theory.</description>
