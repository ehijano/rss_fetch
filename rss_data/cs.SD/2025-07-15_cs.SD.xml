      <title>Less Stress, More Privacy: Stress Detection on Anonymized Speech of Air Traffic Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air traffic control (ATC) demands multi-tasking under time pressure with high consequences of an error. This can induce stress. Detecting stress is a key point in maintaining the high safety standards of ATC. However, processing ATC voice data entails privacy restrictions, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law. Anonymizing the ATC voice data is one way to comply with these restrictions. In this paper, different architectures for stress detection for anonymized ATCO speech are evaluated. Our best networks reach a stress detection accuracy of 93.6% on an anonymized version of the Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) dataset and an accuracy of 80.1% on our anonymized ATC simulation dataset. This shows that privacy does not have to be an impediment in building well-performing deep-learning-based models.</description>

      <title>Mixture of LoRA Experts with Multi-Modal and Multi-Granularity LLM Generative Error Correction for Accented Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial improvements in ASR, performance tends to degrade when faced with adverse conditions such as speaker accents. Generative error correction (GER) leverages the rich linguistic knowledge and exceptional reasoning ability of LLMs, significantly outperforming typical LM methods. However, it lacks specificity in accented speech scenarios. In this study, we leverage GER to improve the accuracy of transcription predictions by addressing the two primary features of accented speech recognition. To fully leverage pronunciation information, we propose the multi-modal GER, which integrates pronunciation information from the speech modality, and the multi-granularity GER, which incorporates fine-grained phoneme-level information related to pronunciation. These two methods enable the LLM to utilize the pronunciation information of accented speech and the semantic information from word-level hypotheses for accurate transcription predictions through LoRA fine-tuning. On the one hand, we employ a three-stage training strategy to train separate multi-modal GER models for each accent to obtain mono-accent LoRA experts. By adopting our proposed HDMoLE method, which incorporates hierarchical routing and dynamic thresholds within the mixture of LoRA experts, we effectively merge multiple mono-accent LoRA experts within a single multi-modal GER to overcome the challenges posed by accent diversity. On the other hand, multi-granularity GER leverages the N-best word-level and phoneme-level hypotheses generated by the HDMoLE model to predict the final accented speech transcriptions. Experimental results on the multi-accent English dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods. Our methods achieve a remarkable relative WER reduction of 67.35% compared to the Whisper-large-v3 baseline.</description>

      <title>Towards Spatial Audio Understanding via Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for spatial audio understanding of first-order ambisonic (FOA) signals through a question answering (QA) paradigm, aiming to extend the scope of sound event localization and detection (SELD) towards spatial scene understanding and reasoning. First, we curate and release fine-grained spatio-temporal textual descriptions for the STARSS23 dataset using a rule-based approach, and further enhance linguistic diversity using large language model (LLM)-based rephrasing. We also introduce a QA dataset aligned with the STARSS23 scenes, covering various aspects such as event presence, localization, spatial, and temporal relationships. To increase language variety, we again leverage LLMs to generate multiple rephrasings per question. Finally, we develop a baseline spatial audio QA model that takes FOA signals and natural language questions as input and provides answers regarding various occurrences, temporal, and spatial relationships of sound events in the scene formulated as a classification task. Despite being trained solely with scene-level question answering supervision, our model achieves performance that is comparable to a fully supervised sound event localization and detection model trained with frame-level spatiotemporal annotations. The results highlight the potential of language-guided approaches for spatial audio understanding and open new directions for integrating linguistic supervision into spatial scene analysis.</description>

      <title>Voice Conversion for Lombard Speaking Style with Implicit and Explicit Acoustic Feature Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems in Lombard speaking style can improve the overall intelligibility of speech, useful for hearing loss and noisy conditions. However, training those models requires a large amount of data and the Lombard effect is challenging to record due to speaker and noise variability and tiring recording conditions. Voice conversion (VC) has been shown to be a useful augmentation technique to train TTS systems in the absence of recorded data from the target speaker in the target speaking style. In this paper, we are concerned with Lombard speaking style transfer. Our goal is to convert speaker identity while preserving the acoustic attributes that define the Lombard speaking style. We compare voice conversion models with implicit and explicit acoustic feature conditioning. We observe that our proposed implicit conditioning strategy achieves an intelligibility gain comparable to the model conditioned on explicit acoustic features, while also preserving speaker similarity.</description>

      <title>BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1: A Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a major shortage of Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) datasets for high resource-to-low resource language pairs such as English-to-Yoruba. Thus, in this study, we curated the Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Speech-to-Speech Translation Corpus Version 1 (BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1). The corpus is based on a hybrid architecture we developed for large-scale direct S2ST corpus creation at reduced cost. To achieve this, we leveraged non speech-to-speech Standard Yoruba (SY) real-time audios and transcripts in the YORULECT Corpus as well as the corresponding Standard English (SE) transcripts. YORULECT Corpus is small scale(1,504) samples, and it does not have paired English audios. Therefore, we generated the SE audios using pre-trained AI models (i.e. Facebook MMS). We also developed an audio augmentation algorithm named AcoustAug based on three latent acoustic features to generate augmented audios from the raw audios of the two languages. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 has 12,032 audio samples per language, which gives a total of 24,064 sample size. The total audio duration for the two languages is 41.20 hours. This size is quite significant. Beyond building S2ST models, BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 can be used to build pretrained models or improve existing ones. The created corpus and Coqui framework were used to build a pretrained Yoruba TTS model (named YoruTTS-0.5) as a proof of concept. The YoruTTS-0.5 gave a F0 RMSE value of 63.54 after 1,000 epochs, which indicates moderate fundamental pitch similarity with the reference real-time audio. Ultimately, the corpus architecture in this study can be leveraged by researchers and developers to curate datasets for multilingual high-resource-to-low-resource African languages. This will bridge the huge digital divides in translations among high and low-resource language pairs. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 and YoruTTS-0.5 are publicly available at (https://bit.ly/40bGMwi).</description>

      <title>Acoustic Wave Modeling Using 2D FDTD: Applications in Unreal Engine For Dynamic Sound Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate sound propagation simulation is essential for delivering immersive experiences in virtual applications, yet industry methods for acoustic modeling often do not account for the full breadth of acoustic wave phenomena. This paper proposes a novel two-dimensional (2D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework that simulates sound propagation as a wave-based model in Unreal Engine, with an emphasis on capturing lower frequency wave phenomena, embedding occlusion, diffraction, reflection and interference in generated impulse responses. The process begins by discretizing the scene geometry into a 2D grid via a top-down projection from which obstacle masks and boundary conditions are derived. A Python-based FDTD solver injects a sine sweep at a source position, and virtual quadraphonic microphone arrays record pressure field responses at pre-defined listener positions. De-convolution of the pressure responses yields multi-channel impulse responses that retain spatial directionality which are then integrated into Unreal Engine's audio pipeline for dynamic playback. Benchmark tests confirm agreement with analytical expectations, and the paper outlines hybrid extensions aimed at commercial viability.</description>

      <title>SC-TSE: Speaker Consistency-Aware Target Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) uses a reference cue to extract the target speech from a mixture. In TSE systems relying on audio cues, the speaker embedding from the enrolled speech is crucial to performance. However, these embeddings may suffer from speaker identity confusion. Unlike previous studies that focus on improving speaker embedding extraction, we improve TSE performance from the perspective of speaker consistency. In this paper, we propose a speaker consistency-aware target speaker extraction method that incorporates a centroid-based speaker consistency loss. This approach enhances TSE performance by ensuring speaker consistency between the enrolled and extracted speech. In addition, we integrate conditional loss suppression into the training process. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in advancing the TSE performance. A speech demo is available online.\footnote{https://sc-tse.netlify.app/</description>

      <title>Ensemble Confidence Calibration for Sound Event Detection in Open-environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound event detection (SED) has made strong progress in controlled environments with clear event categories. However, real-world applications often take place in open environments. In such cases, current methods often produce predictions with too much confidence and lack proper ways to measure uncertainty. This limits their ability to adapt and perform well in new situations. To solve this problem, we are the first to use ensemble methods in SED to improve robustness against out-of-domain (OOD) inputs. We propose a confidence calibration method called Energy-based Open-World Softmax (EOW-Softmax), which helps the system better handle uncertainty in unknown scenes. We further apply EOW-Softmax to sound occurrence and overlap detection (SOD) by adjusting the prediction. In this way, the model becomes more adaptable while keeping its ability to detect overlapping events. Experiments show that our method improves performance in open environments. It reduces overconfidence and increases the ability to handle OOD situations.</description>

      <title>THAI Speech Emotion Recognition (THAI-SER) corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first sizeable corpus of Thai speech emotion recognition, THAI-SER, containing 41 hours and 36 minutes (27,854 utterances) from 100 recordings made in different recording environments: Zoom and two studio setups. The recordings contain both scripted and improvised sessions, acted by 200 professional actors (112 females and 88 males, aged 18 to 55) and were directed by professional directors. There are five primary emotions: neutral, angry, happy, sad, and frustrated, assigned to the actors when recording utterances. The utterances are annotated with an emotional category using crowdsourcing. To control the annotation process's quality, we also design an extensive filtering and quality control scheme to ensure that the majority agreement score remains above 0.71. We evaluate our annotated corpus using two metrics: inter-annotator reliability and human recognition accuracy. Inter-annotator reliability score was calculated using Krippendorff's alpha, where our corpus, after filtering, achieved an alpha score of 0.692, higher than a recommendation of 0.667. For human recognition accuracy, our corpus scored up to 0.772 post-filtering. We also provide the results of the model trained on the corpus evaluated on both in-corpus and cross-corpus setups. The corpus is publicly available under a Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0, as well as our codes for the experiments.</description>

      <title>MB-RIRs: a Synthetic Room Impulse Response Dataset with Frequency-Dependent Absorption Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of four strategies for improving the ecological validity of synthetic room impulse response (RIR) datasets for monoaural Speech Enhancement (SE). We implement three features on top of the traditional image source method-based (ISM) shoebox RIRs: multiband absorption coefficients, source directivity and receiver directivity. We additionally consider mesh-based RIRs from the SoundSpaces dataset. We then train a DeepFilternet3 model for each RIR dataset and evaluate the performance on a test set of real RIRs both objectively and subjectively. We find that RIRs which use frequency-dependent acoustic absorption coefficients (MB-RIRs) can obtain +0.51dB of SDR and a +8.9 MUSHRA score when evaluated on real RIRs. The MB-RIRs dataset is publicly available for free download.</description>

      <title>ASTAR-NTU solution to AudioMOS Challenge 2025 Track1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation of text-to-music systems is constrained by the cost and availability of collecting experts for assessment. AudioMOS 2025 Challenge track 1 is created to automatically predict music impression (MI) as well as text alignment (TA) between the prompt and the generated musical piece. This paper reports our winning system, which uses a dual-branch architecture with pre-trained MuQ and RoBERTa models as audio and text encoders. A cross-attention mechanism fuses the audio and text representations. For training, we reframe the MI and TA prediction as a classification task. To incorporate the ordinal nature of MOS scores, one-hot labels are converted to a soft distribution using a Gaussian kernel. On the official test set, a single model trained with this method achieves a system-level Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) of 0.991 for MI and 0.952 for TA, corresponding to a relative improvement of 21.21\% in MI SRCC and 31.47\% in TA SRCC over the challenge baseline.</description>

Abstract: We present a demo of DQLoRA, an Adapter-Guided Distillation framework for robust speech recognition under low-resource and noisy conditions. Our method employs a frozen Whisper model as the teacher to provide semantic supervision, and a lightweight Wav2Vec2 student equipped with QLoRA-based Adapters. Training is conducted on the FLEURS dataset augmented with DNS-style noise. The student is optimized by jointly minimizing CTC loss and KL-based distillation loss, enabling efficient adaptation while preserving recognition accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative audio models, distinguishing between human-composed and generated music is becoming increasingly challenging. As a response, models for detecting fake music have been proposed. In this work, we explore the robustness of such systems under audio augmentations. To evaluate model generalization, we constructed a dataset consisting of both real and synthetic music generated using several systems. We then apply a range of audio transformations and analyze how they affect classification accuracy. We test the performance of a recent state-of-the-art musical deepfake detection model in the presence of audio augmentations. The performance of the model decreases significantly even with the introduction of light augmentations.</description>

      <title>Radif corpus: a symbolic dataset for non-metric iranian classical music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-metric music forms the core of the repertoire in Iranian classical music. Dastgahi music serves as the underlying theoretical system for both Iranian art music and certain folk traditions. At the heart of Iranian classical music lies the radif, a foundational repertoire that organizes melodic material central to performance and pedagogy.
  In this study, we introduce the first digital corpus representing the complete non-metrical radif repertoire, covering all 13 existing components of this repertoire. We provide MIDI files (about 281 minutes in total) and data spreadsheets describing notes, note durations, intervals, and hierarchical structures for 228 pieces of music. We faithfully represent the tonality including quarter-tones, and the non-metric aspect. Furthermore, we provide supporting basic statistics, and measures of complexity and similarity over the corpus.
  Our corpus provides a platform for computational studies of Iranian classical music. Researchers might employ it in studying melodic patterns, investigating improvisational styles, or for other tasks in music information retrieval, music theory, and computational (ethno)musicology.</description>

      <title>AudioMAE++: learning better masked audio representations with SwiGLU FFNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) trained on audio spectrogram patches have emerged as a prominent approach for learning self-supervised audio representations. While several recent papers have evaluated key aspects of training MAEs on audio data, the majority of these approaches still leverage vanilla transformer building blocks, whereas the transformer community has seen steady integration of newer architectural advancements. In this work, we propose AudioMAE++, a revamped audio masked autoencoder with two such enhancements, namely macaron-style transformer blocks with gated linear units. When pretrained on the AudioSet dataset, the proposed AudioMAE++ models outperform existing MAE based approaches on 10 diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating excellent performance on audio classification and speech-based benchmarks. The proposed AudioMAE++ models also demonstrate excellent scaling characteristics, outperforming directly comparable standard MAE baselines with up to 4x more parameters.</description>

      <title>WildFX: A DAW-Powered Pipeline for In-the-Wild Audio FX Graph Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in end-to-end AI music generation, AI-driven modeling of professional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) workflows remains challenging. In particular, while there is growing interest in neural black-box modeling of audio effect graphs (e.g. reverb, compression, equalization), AI-based approaches struggle to replicate the nuanced signal flow and parameter interactions used in professional workflows. Existing differentiable plugin approaches often diverge from real-world tools, exhibiting inferior performance relative to simplified neural controllers under equivalent computational constraints. We introduce WildFX, a pipeline containerized with Docker for generating multi-track audio mixing datasets with rich effect graphs, powered by a professional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) backend. WildFX supports seamless integration of cross-platform commercial plugins or any plugins in the wild, in VST/VST3/LV2/CLAP formats, enabling structural complexity (e.g., sidechains, crossovers) and achieving efficient parallelized processing. A minimalist metadata interface simplifies project/plugin configuration. Experiments demonstrate the pipeline's validity through blind estimation of mixing graphs, plugin/gain parameters, and its ability to bridge AI research with practical DSP demands. The code is available on: https://github.com/IsaacYQH/WildFX.</description>

      <title>SemAlignVC: Enhancing zero-shot timbre conversion using semantic alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) synthesizes speech in a target speaker's voice while preserving linguistic and paralinguistic content. However, timbre leakage-where source speaker traits persist-remains a challenge, especially in neural codec and LLM-based VC, where quantized representations entangle speaker identity with content. We introduce SemAlignVC, an architecture designed to prevent timbre leakage using SemAlign, a novel method that aligns text and audio representations to ensure speaker-independent semantic encoding. This disentangled representation conditions an autoregressive transformer for high-fidelity conversion without explicit speaker embeddings. Experiments show SemAlignVC significantly reduces timbre leakage, outperforming baselines in speaker timbre similarity, intelligibility, and naturalness, making it a robust, privacy-preserving, and generalizable VC solution. Audio samples can be accessed at https://shivammehta25.github.io/SemAlignVC/</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Bioacoustic Signal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have shown a remarkable ability to extract meaning from unstructured data, offering new ways to interpret biomedical signals beyond traditional numerical methods. In this study, we present a matrix factorization framework for bioacoustic signal analysis which is enhanced by large language models. The focus is on separating bioacoustic signals that commonly overlap in clinical recordings, using matrix factorization to decompose the mixture into interpretable components. A large language model is then applied to the separated signals to associate distinct acoustic patterns with potential medical conditions such as cardiac rhythm disturbances or respiratory abnormalities. Recordings were obtained from a digital stethoscope applied to a clinical manikin to ensure a controlled and high-fidelity acquisition environment. This hybrid approach does not require labeled data or prior knowledge of source types, and it provides a more interpretable and accessible framework for clinical decision support. The method demonstrates promise for integration into future intelligent diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>Can We Really Repurpose Multi-Speaker ASR Corpus for Speaker Diarization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural speaker diarization is widely used for overlap-aware speaker diarization, but it requires large multi-speaker datasets for training. To meet this data requirement, large datasets are often constructed by combining multiple corpora, including those originally designed for multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, ASR datasets often feature loosely defined segment boundaries that do not align with the stricter conventions of diarization benchmarks. In this work, we show that such boundary looseness significantly impacts the diarization error rate, reducing evaluation reliability. We also reveal that models trained on data with varying boundary precision tend to learn dataset-specific looseness, leading to poor generalization across out-of-domain datasets. Training with standardized tight boundaries via forced alignment improves not only diarization performance, especially in streaming scenarios, but also ASR performance when combined with simple post-processing.</description>

Abstract: Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease, alters speech patterns, creating communication barriers and raising privacy concerns. Current speech technologies, such as automatic speech transcription (ASR), struggle with dementia and atypical speech, further challenging accessibility. This paper presents a novel dementia obfuscation in speech framework, ClaritySpeech, integrating ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data environments without fine-tuning. Results show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1 score across various adversarial settings and modalities (audio, text, fusion) for ADReSS and ADReSSo, respectively, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. We also find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15 for ADReSSo) and speech quality from 1.65 to ~2.15, enhancing privacy and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Controllable joint noise reduction and hearing loss compensation using a differentiable auditory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based hearing loss compensation (HLC) seeks to enhance speech intelligibility and quality for hearing impaired listeners using neural networks. One major challenge of HLC is the lack of a ground-truth target. Recent works have used neural networks to emulate non-differentiable auditory peripheral models in closed-loop frameworks, but this approach lacks flexibility. Alternatively, differentiable auditory models allow direct optimization, yet previous studies focused on individual listener profiles, or joint noise reduction (NR) and HLC without balancing each task. This work formulates NR and HLC as a multi-task learning problem, training a system to simultaneously predict denoised and compensated signals from noisy speech and audiograms using a differentiable auditory model. Results show the system achieves similar objective metric performance to systems trained for each task separately, while being able to adjust the balance between NR and HLC during inference.</description>

Abstract: We present the DKU system for Task 2 of the MLC-SLM Challenge, which aims to perform multi-speaker automatic speech recognition directly from raw audio without Oracle speaker labels or time boundaries. Our approach builds upon a diarization-aware framework integrating speaker embeddings and temporal utterance boundaries into a Qwen2.5-based large language model (LLM). Then, we enhance the system's multilingual performance by fine-tuning language-specific adapters and LoRA modules within the LLM decoder. Finally, our system achieves the tcpWER of 23.56\% and 18.08\% on the development and test sets of the MLC-SLM dataset, substantially outperforming the official baseline.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Stereo Sound Event Detection with BiMamba and Pretrained PSELDnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training methods have greatly improved the performance of sound event localization and detection (SELD). However, existing Transformer-based models still face high computational cost. To solve this problem, we present a stereo SELD system using a pre-trained PSELDnet and a bidirectional Mamba sequence model. Specifically, we replace the Conformer module with a BiMamba module. We also use asymmetric convolutions to better capture the time and frequency relationships in the audio signal. Test results on the DCASE2025 Task 3 development dataset show that our method performs better than both the baseline and the original PSELDnet with a Conformer decoder. In addition, the proposed model costs fewer computing resources than the baselines. These results show that the BiMamba architecture is effective for solving key challenges in SELD tasks. The source code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/ alexandergwm/DCASE2025 TASK3 Stereo PSELD Mamba.</description>

      <title>Knowing When to Quit: Probabilistic Early Exits for Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based single-channel speech separation has improved considerably, in large part driven by increasingly compute- and parameter-efficient neural network architectures. Most such architectures are, however, designed with a fixed compute and parameter budget, and consequently cannot scale to varying compute demands or resources, which limits their use in embedded and heterogeneous devices such as mobile phones and hearables. To enable such use-cases we design a neural network architecture for speech separation capable of early-exit, and we propose an uncertainty-aware probabilistic framework to jointly model the clean speech signal and error variance which we use to derive probabilistic early-exit conditions in terms of desired signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate our methods on both speech separation and enhancement tasks, and we show that a single early-exit model can be competitive with state-of-the-art models trained at many compute and parameter budgets. Our framework enables fine-grained dynamic compute-scaling of speech separation networks while achieving state-of-the-art performance and interpretable exit conditions.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Adaptation of Deep Prior Neural Networks For Room Impulse Response Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep Prior framework has emerged as a powerful generative tool which can be used for reconstructing sound fields in an environment from few sparse pressure measurements. It employs a neural network that is trained solely on a limited set of available data and acts as an implicit prior which guides the solution of the underlying optimization problem. However, a significant limitation of the Deep Prior approach is its inability to generalize to new acoustic configurations, such as changes in the position of a sound source. As a consequence, the network must be retrained from scratch for every new setup, which is both computationally intensive and time-consuming. To address this, we investigate transfer learning in Deep Prior via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which enables efficient fine-tuning of a pre-trained neural network by introducing a low-rank decomposition of trainable parameters, thus allowing the network to adapt to new measurement sets with minimal computational overhead. We embed LoRA into a MultiResUNet-based Deep Prior model and compare its adaptation performance against full fine-tuning of all parameters as well as classical retraining, particularly in scenarios where only a limited number of microphones are used. The results indicate that fine-tuning, whether done completely or via LoRA, is especially advantageous when the source location is the sole changing parameter, preserving high physical fidelity, and highlighting the value of transfer learning for acoustics applications.</description>

      <title>Generative Audio Language Modeling with Continuous-valued Tokens and Masked Next-Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive next-token prediction with the Transformer decoder has become a de facto standard in large language models (LLMs), achieving remarkable success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at scale. Extending this paradigm to audio poses unique challenges due to its inherently continuous nature. We research audio generation with a causal language model (LM) without discrete tokens. We leverage token-wise diffusion to model the continuous distribution of the next continuous-valued token. Our approach delivers significant improvements over previous discrete solution, AudioGen, achieving 20% and 40% relative gains on AudioCaps in Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, respectively. Additionally, we propose a novel masked next-token prediction task that incorporates masked prediction into the causal LM framework. On AudioCaps, the innovation yields 41% and 33% relative FAD improvements over AudioGen Base (285M) and AudioGen Large (1B) models, respectively, and is on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion models. Furthermore, we achieve these results with significantly fewer parameters -- 193M for our Base and 462M for our Large models.</description>

      <title>The Man Behind the Sound: Demystifying Audio Private Attribute Profiling via Multimodal Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our research uncovers a novel privacy risk associated with multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the ability to infer sensitive personal attributes from audio data -- a technique we term audio private attribute profiling. This capability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured without direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and text, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can be exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in understanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the lack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2) the limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from audio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark dataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world data, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we propose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary strengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in inferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the ALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in generating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts significantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense strategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work validates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs, highlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>DualDub: Video-to-Soundtrack Generation via Joint Speech and Background Audio Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent video-to-audio (V2A) models can generate realistic background audio from visual input, they largely overlook speech, an essential part of many video soundtracks. This paper proposes a new task, video-to-soundtrack (V2ST) generation, which aims to jointly produce synchronized background audio and speech within a unified framework. To tackle V2ST, we introduce DualDub, a unified framework built on a multimodal language model that integrates a multimodal encoder, a cross-modal aligner, and dual decoding heads for simultaneous background audio and speech generation. Specifically, our proposed cross-modal aligner employs causal and non-causal attention mechanisms to improve synchronization and acoustic harmony. Besides, to handle data scarcity, we design a curriculum learning strategy that progressively builds the multimodal capability. Finally, we introduce DualBench, the first benchmark for V2ST evaluation with a carefully curated test set and comprehensive metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that DualDub achieves state-of-the-art performance, generating high-quality and well-synchronized soundtracks with both speech and background audio.</description>

      <title>Tiny-Align: Bridging Automatic Speech Recognition and Large Language Model on the Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13766v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), when deployed on edge devices (called edge ASR-LLM), can serve as a powerful personalized assistant to enable audio-based interaction for users. Compared to text-based interaction, edge ASR-LLM allows accessible and natural audio interactions. Unfortunately, existing ASR-LLM models are mainly trained in high-performance computing environments and produce substantial model weights, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. More importantly, to better serve users' personalized needs, the ASR-LLM must be able to learn from each distinct user, given that audio input often contains highly personalized characteristics that necessitate personalized on-device training. Since individually fine-tuning the ASR or LLM often leads to suboptimal results due to modality-specific limitations, end-to-end training ensures seamless integration of audio features and language understanding (cross-modal alignment), ultimately enabling a more personalized and efficient adaptation on edge devices. However, due to the complex training requirements and substantial computational demands of existing approaches, cross-modal alignment between ASR audio and LLM can be challenging on edge devices. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient cross-modal alignment framework that bridges ASR and LLMs on edge devices to handle personalized audio input. Our framework enables efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained devices like NVIDIA Jetson Orin (8GB RAM), achieving 50x training time speedup while improving the alignment quality by more than 50\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>Robust Localization of Partially Fake Speech: Metrics, Models, and Out-of-Domain Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial audio deepfake localization pose unique challenges and remain underexplored compared to full-utterance spoofing detection. While recent methods report strong in-domain performance, their real-world utility remains unclear. In this analysis, we critically examine the limitations of current evaluation practices, particularly the widespread use of Equal Error Rate (EER), which often obscures generalization and deployment readiness. We propose reframing the localization task as a sequential anomaly detection problem and advocate for the use of threshold-dependent metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which better reflect real-world behavior. Specifically, we analyze the performance of the open-source Coarse-to-Fine Proposal Refinement Framework (CFPRF), which achieves a 20-ms EER of 7.61% on the in-domain PartialSpoof evaluation set, but 43.25% and 27.59% on the LlamaPartialSpoof and Half-Truth out-of-domain test sets. Interestingly, our reproduced version of the same model performs worse on in-domain data (9.84%) but better on the out-of-domain sets (41.72% and 14.98%, respectively). This highlights the risks of over-optimizing for in-domain EER, which can lead to models that perform poorly in real-world scenarios. It also suggests that while deep learning models can be effective on in-domain data, they generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios, failing to detect novel synthetic samples and misclassifying unfamiliar bona fide audio. Finally, we observe that adding more bona fide or fully synthetic utterances to the training data often degrades performance, whereas adding partially fake utterances improves it.</description>

      <title>Token-based Audio Inpainting via Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps, they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset, extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method can be found at https://iftach21.github.io/</description>

      <title>AGAV-Rater: Adapting Large Multimodal Model for AI-Generated Audio-Visual Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many video-to-audio (VTA) methods have been proposed for dubbing silent AI-generated videos. An efficient quality assessment method for AI-generated audio-visual content (AGAV) is crucial for ensuring audio-visual quality. Existing audio-visual quality assessment methods struggle with unique distortions in AGAVs, such as unrealistic and inconsistent elements. To address this, we introduce AGAVQA-3k, the first large-scale AGAV quality assessment dataset, comprising $3,382$ AGAVs from $16$ VTA methods. AGAVQA-3k includes two subsets: AGAVQA-MOS, which provides multi-dimensional scores for audio quality, content consistency, and overall quality, and AGAVQA-Pair, designed for optimal AGAV pair selection. We further propose AGAV-Rater, a LMM-based model that can score AGAVs, as well as audio and music generated from text, across multiple dimensions, and selects the best AGAV generated by VTA methods to present to the user. AGAV-Rater achieves state-of-the-art performance on AGAVQA-3k, Text-to-Audio, and Text-to-Music datasets. Subjective tests also confirm that AGAV-Rater enhances VTA performance and user experience. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/charlotte9524/AGAV-Rater.</description>

      <title>A Noise-Robust Turn-Taking System for Real-World Dialogue Robots: A Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turn-taking is a crucial aspect of human-robot interaction, directly influencing conversational fluidity and user engagement. While previous research has explored turn-taking models in controlled environments, their robustness in real-world settings remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a noise-robust voice activity projection (VAP) model, based on a Transformer architecture, to enhance real-time turn-taking in dialogue robots. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted a field experiment in a shopping mall, comparing the VAP system with a conventional cloud-based speech recognition system. Our analysis covered both subjective user evaluations and objective behavioral analysis. The results showed that the proposed system significantly reduced response latency, leading to a more natural conversation where both the robot and users responded faster. The subjective evaluations suggested that faster responses contribute to a better interaction experience.</description>

      <title>Handling Domain Shifts for Anomalous Sound Detection: A Review of DCASE-Related Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When detecting anomalous sounds in complex environments, one of the main difficulties is that trained models must be sensitive to subtle differences in monitored target signals, while many practical applications also require them to be insensitive to changes in acoustic domains. Examples of such domain shifts include changing the type of microphone or the location of acoustic sensors, which can have a much stronger impact on the acoustic signal than subtle anomalies themselves. Moreover, users typically aim to train a model only on source domain data, which they may have a relatively large collection of, and they hope that such a trained model will be able to generalize well to an unseen target domain by providing only a minimal number of samples to characterize the acoustic signals in that domain. In this work, we review and discuss recent publications focusing on this domain generalization problem for anomalous sound detection in the context of the DCASE challenges on acoustic machine condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>Human-CLAP: Human-perception-based contrastive language-audio pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) is widely used for audio generation and recognition tasks. For example, CLAPScore, which utilizes the similarity of CLAP embeddings, has been a major metric for the evaluation of the relevance between audio and text in text-to-audio. However, the relationship between CLAPScore and human subjective evaluation scores is still unclarified. We show that CLAPScore has a low correlation with human subjective evaluation scores. Additionally, we propose a human-perception-based CLAP called Human-CLAP by training a contrastive language-audio model using the subjective evaluation score. In our experiments, the results indicate that our Human-CLAP improved the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) between the CLAPScore and the subjective evaluation scores by more than 0.25 compared with the conventional CLAP.</description>

      <title>DeepGesture: A conversational gesture synthesis system based on emotions and semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics, the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs.
  In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on multimodal signals - text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to support controllable gesture generation across affective states. To visualize results, we implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic voices - marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware digital humans.

      <title>Hear-Your-Click: Interactive Object-Specific Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods relying on global video information struggle with complex scenes and generating audio tailored to specific objects. To address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A framework enabling users to generate sounds for specific objects by clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with audio. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation strategies, Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation (MLM), to enhance the model's sensitivity to segmented objects. To measure audio-visual correspondence, we designed a new evaluation metric, the CAV score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework offers more precise control and improves generation performance across various metrics.

      <title>StreamUni: Achieving Streaming Speech Translation with a Unified Large Speech-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality. However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.</description>
