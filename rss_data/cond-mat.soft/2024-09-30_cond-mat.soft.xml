      <title>Osmotically-induced rupture of viral capsids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple model is proposed aimed to investigate how the amount of dissociated ions influences the mechanical stability of viral capsids. After an osmotic and mechanical equilibrium is established with the outer solution, a non-adiabatic change in salt concentration at the external environment is considered, which results in a significant solvent inflow across the capsid surface, eventually leading to its rupture. The key assumption behind such an osmotic shock mechanism is that solvent flow takes place at timescales much shorter than the ones typical of ionic diffusion. In order to theoretically describe this effect, we herein propose a thermodynamic model based on the traditional Flory theory. The proposed approach is further combined with a continuum Hookian elastic model of surface stretching and pore-opening along the lines of a Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT), allowing us to establish the conditions under which capsid mechanical instability takes place. Despite its non-local character, the proposed model is able to capture most of the relevant physical mechanisms controlling capsid stability, namely the volume exclusion and entropy of mixing effects among the densely-packed components, the elastic cost for capsid stretching and further pore opening, the Donnan equilibrium across the interface, as well as the large entropy loss resulting from folding the viral genome into close-packed configurations inside the capsid. It is shown that, depending on the particular combination of initial condition and capsid surface strength, the capsid can either become unstable after removal of a prescribed amount of external salt, or be fully stable against osmotic shock, regardless of the amount of ionic dilution.</description>

      <title>Windmill droplets. Optical-induced rotation of biphase oil-in-water droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of microdroplet manipulation, optical tweezers have been used to form and grow droplets, move them to specific locations, or to measure forces between droplet pairs. However, the exploration of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in optically trapped droplets remains largely uncharted. Here, we report the rotation of biphasic droplets fabricated by co-emulsifying two immiscible liquids (i.e., hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon oils) with a refractive index mismatch in water. When trapped, droplets of a specific geometry begin to rotate around the axis of the laser beam, in what appears to be a dissipative, out-of-equilibrium phenomenon. The rotational frequency, obtained from image analysis of the rotating droplets, is stable and proportional to the beam power. Remarkably, droplets that do not interact with the trapping beam can also be rotated indirectly. This is achieved by positioning the droplets at the center of a circular arrangement of multiple, sequentially activated traps. In this case, the droplet orients towards the location of the active trap by a mechanism yet to be understood. Altogether, our results demonstrate out-from-equilibrium phenomenology in optically trapped biphase droplets, which could inspire the development of devices based on them (e.g., optically induced mixing, etc.). In addition, they may shed light on fundamental principles of optical manipulation of asymmetric particles.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained patchy turbulence in shear-thinning active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial suspensions and other active fluids can develop highly dynamical vortex states called mesoscale turbulence. Here, we reveal the pronounced effect of non-Newtonian rheology of the carrier fluid, concentrating on shear thinning. Remarkably, this leads to hysteretic emergence of the turbulent state as a function of activity. A self-sustained heterogeneous state of coexisting turbulent and quiescent areas is identified. We find the signature of a directed percolation transition. Our results are important, for instance, when addressing active objects in biological media.</description>

      <title>Stress Isotropization in Weakly Jammed Granular Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When sheared, granular media experience localized plastic events known as shear transformations which generate anisotropic internal stresses. Under strong confining pressure, the response of granular media to local force multipoles is essentially linear, resulting in quadrupolar propagated stresses. This can lead to additional plastic events along the direction of relative stress increase. Closer to the unjamming transition however, as the confining pressure and the shear modulus vanish, nonlinearities become relevant. Yet, the consequences of these nonlinearities on the stress response to plastic events remains poorly understood. We show with granular dynamics simulations that this brings about an isotropization of the propagated stresses, in agreement with a previously developed continuum elastic model. This could significantly modify the yielding transition of weakly-jammed amorphous media, which has been conceptualized as an avalanche of such plastic events.</description>

      <title>"Faster is slower" in soft/rigid granular mixtures: soft particles induce flow intermittency and avalanches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instabilities and avalanches in granular flows represent hallmarks of failure: they can both disrupt industrial process flows and signal dangerous conditions, like those found in grain silos and snowy mountaintops. We investigate intermittency and avalanches in flows of granular materials through a quasi-2D hopper. Mixtures of rigid polypropylene and soft polyacrylamide particles flow through a hopper constriction, driven by gravity. A combination of high speed imaging, particle identification and tracking analyses enable us to measure quantities including particle velocities, outflow rates, the time intervals between consecutive particle exits, and the geometric properties of any temporary arches that form during a flow test. As the fraction of rigid particles increases in the mixture, the velocity of exiting particles increases. So too, however, does the probability of complete clogging. While soft particles exhibit slower velocities at the hopper exit, they also facilitate greater overall discharge rates. Simultaneously, the presence of soft particles induces both intermittency and avalanches in the flow. In this case, arches that could form to permanently block the flow are more likely to be temporary in nature. Interestingly, the identity of the particle that falls first from a temporary arch correlates linearly with the mixing fraction in the overall sample. That is, soft particles, despite their correlation with flow instabilities, are not significantly more likely to initiate an avalanche by falling first from a temporary arch. Investigating the geometry of these arches suggests that the particle that forms the largest bond angle with its neighbors is the one that causes an arch to fail, regardless of its identity as a soft or rigid particle.</description>

      <title>The ion activated attractive patchy particles model and its application to the liquid-vapour phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patchy particles are an intriguing subject of study and indeed a model system in the field of soft matter physics. In recent years, patchy particle models have been applied to describe a wide variety of systems, including colloidal crystals, macromolecular interactions, liquid crystals, and nanoparticle assemblies. Given the importance of the topic, rationalizing and capturing the basic features of these models is crucial to their correct application in specific systems. In this study, we extend the ion-activated attractive patchy particles model previously employed to elucidate the phase behavior of protein solutions in the presence of trivalent salts. Our extension incorporates the effect of repulsion between unoccupied and occupied binding sites, depicted as patches. Furthermore, we examine the influence of model parameters on the liquid-vapor coexistence region within the phase diagram, employing numerical methods. A deeper understanding of this model will facilitate a better comprehension of the effects observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Connecting anomalous elasticity and sub-Arrhenius structural dynamics in a cell-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structural dynamics of many-particle glassy systems remains a key challenge in statistical physics. Over the last decade, glassy dynamics has also been reported in biological tissues, but is far from being understood. It was recently shown that vertex models of dense biological tissue exhibit very atypical, sub-Arrhenius dynamics, and here we ask whether such atypical structural dynamics of vertex models are related to unusual elastic properties. It is known that at zero temperature these models have an elasticity controlled by their under-constrained or isostatic nature, but little is known about how their elasticity varies with temperature. To address this question we investigate the 2D Voronoi model and measure the temperature dependence of the intermediate-time plateau shear modulus and the bulk modulus. We find that unlike in conventional glassformers, these moduli increase monotonically with temperature until the system fluidizes. We further show that the structural relaxation time can be quantitatively linked to the plateau shear modulus $G_p$, i.e.\ $G_p$ modulates the typical energy barrier scale for cell rearrangements. This suggests that the anomalous, structural dynamics of the 2D Voronoi model originates in its unusual elastic properties. Based on our results, we hypothesize that under-constrained systems might more generally give rise to a new class of "ultra-strong" glassformers.</description>

      <title>Chirality Modulated Accumulation of Chiral Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed motion up a concentration gradient is crucial for the survival and maintenance of numerous biological systems, such as sperms moving towards an egg during fertilization or ciliates moving towards a food source. In these systems, chirality - manifested as a rotational torque - plays a vital role in facilitating directed motion. While systematic studies of active molecules in activity gradients exist, the effect of chirality remains little studied. In this study, we examine the simplest case of a chiral active particle connected to a passive particle in a spatially varying activity field. We demonstrate that this minimal setup can exhibit rich emergent tactic behaviors, with the chiral torque serving as the tuning parameter. Notably, when the chiral torque is sufficiently large, even a small passive particle enables the system to display the desired accumulation behavior. This study provides valuable insights into the design principles of hybrid bio-molecular devices of the future.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions alter density and stress fluctuations in shear-thickening suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discontinuous shear thickening (DST) in dense suspensions is accompanied by significant fluctuations in stress at a fixed shear rate. In this work, normal stress fluctuations are shown to have a one-to-one relationship with the formation and dissolution of local high-density regions. Namely, a burst in the force response corresponds to the spontaneous appearance of inhomogeneity. We observe that boundary conditions can significantly alter the spatiotemporal scale of these fluctuations, from short-lived to more sustained and enduring patterns. We estimate the occurrence frequency R and the average intensity Q of individual bursts/inhomogeneity events. The growth of R with the shear rate is the most rapid for the rigid boundary, whereas Q is nonmonotonic with confinement stiffness. Our results indicate that boundary conditions alter the development of inhomogeneity and thus the stress response under shear.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian approach to origami vertex analysis: Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of origami in engineering has significantly expanded in recent years, spanning deployable structures across scales, folding robotics, and mechanical metamaterials. However, finding foldable paths can be a formidable task as the kinematics are determined by a nonlinear system of equations, often with several degrees of freedom. In this work, we leverage a Lagrangian approach to derive reduced-order compatibility conditions for rigid-facet origami vertices with reflection and rotational symmetries. Then, using the reduced-order conditions, we derive exact, multi-degree of freedom solutions for degree 6 and degree 8 vertices with prescribed symmetries. The exact kinematic solutions allow us to efficiently investigate the topology of allowable kinematics, including the consideration of a self-contact constraint, and then visually interpret the role of geometric design parameters on these admissible fold paths by monitoring the change in the kinematic topology. We then introduce a procedure to construct lower symmetry kinematic solutions by breaking symmetry of higher order kinematic solutions in a systematic way that preserves compatibility. The multi-degree of freedom solutions discovered here should assist with building intuition of the kinematic feasibility of higher degree origami vertices and also facilitate the development of new algorithmic procedures for origami-engineering design.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to the osmotic second virial coefficient of protein solutions and its application to liquid liquid phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The osmotic second virial coefficient B2 is an important parameter to describe the interactions and phase behavior of protein solutions, including colloidal systems and macromolecular solutions. Another key parameter to describe the driving force of the nucleation of a new phase is the supersaturation, which is used in the classical nucleation theory framework and is connected with the favorable contribution in the Gibbs free energy in the bulk solution. In this article, we establish a connection between B2 calculated from small angle Xray scattering (SAXS) data and the values of B2 obtained from supersaturation measurements using thermodynamics considerations. The values of the second virial coefficient calculated employing this method agree with those determined via SAXS in the region near the liquid liquid phase separation border for human serum albumin and bovine serum albumin. The general relations adopted are shown to be useful for the estimation of the second virial coefficient B2 for globular proteins, in the proximity of the binodal biphasic coexistent region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The viscosity of supercooled liquids notably increases with decreasing temperature, leading to solidification through a glass transition. This process is accompanied by dynamic heterogeneity, characterized by persistent dynamic spatial correlations. This study investigates how dynamic heterogeneity influences the applicability of the Navier-Stokes equations to the flow of supercooled liquids. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, we subjected a two-dimensional supercooled liquid to a localized dipolar force field and compared the resulting steady velocity field with the prediction from the Navier-Stokes equations. Our approach captures a significant breakdown of the Navier-Stokes equations in real space; specifically, supercooled liquids flow more rapidly near the external force than the prediction from the Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, this deviation is enhanced by the supercooling and is accompanied by the growth of dynamic heterogeneity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interface representation of the contact process (CP) at its directed-percolation critical point, where the scaling properties of the interface can be related to those of the original particle model. Interestingly, such a behavior happens to be intrinsically anomalous and more complex than that described by the standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling Ansatz of surface kinetic roughening. We expand on a previous numerical study by Dickman and Mu\~noz [Phys. Rev. E 62, 7632 (2000)] to fully characterize the kinetic roughening universality class for interface dimensions $d=1, 2$, and 3. Beyond obtaining scaling exponent values, we characterize the interface fluctuations via their probability density function (PDF) and covariance, seen to display universal properties which are qualitatively similar to those recently assessed for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) and other important universality classes of kinetic roughening. Quantitatively, while for $d=1$ the interface covariance seems to be well described by the KPZ, Airy$_1$ covariance, no such agreement occurs in terms of the fluctuation PDF nor the scaling exponents.</description>

      <title>Motility-Induced Pinning in Flocking System with Discrete Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a motility-induced pinning transition in the active Ising model for a self-propelled particle system with discrete symmetry. This model was known to exhibit a liquid-gas type flocking phase transition, but a recent study reveals that the polar order is metastable due to droplet excitation. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that, for an intermediate alignment interaction strength, the steady state is characterized by traveling local domains, which renders the polar order short-ranged in both space and time. We further demonstrate that interfaces between colliding domains become pinned as the alignment interaction strength increases. A resonating back-and-forth motion of individual self-propelled particles across interfaces is identified as a mechanism for the pinning. We present a numerical phase diagram for the motility-induced pinning transition, and an approximate analytic theory for the growth and shrink dynamics of pinned interfaces. Our results show that pinned interfaces grow to a macroscopic size preventing the polar order in the regime where the particle diffusion rate is sufficiently smaller than the self-propulsion rate. The growth behavior in the opposite regime and its implications on the polar order remain unresolved and require further investigation.</description>

Abstract: Intermittency refers to the broken self-similarity of turbulent flows caused by anomalous spatio-temporal fluctuations. In this Letter, we ask how intermittency is affected by a non-dissipative viscosity, known as odd viscosity (also Hall or gyro-viscosity), which appears in parity-breaking fluids such as magnetized polyatomic gases, electron fluids under magnetic field and spinning colloids or grains. Using a combination of Navier-Stokes simulations and theory, we show that intermittency is suppressed by odd viscosity at small scales. This effect is caused by parity-breaking waves, induced by odd viscosity, that break the multiple scale invariances of the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on this insight, we construct a two-channel helical shell model that reproduces the basic phenomenology of turbulent odd-viscous fluids including the suppression of anomalous scaling. Our findings illustrate how a fully developed direct cascade that is entirely self-similar can emerge below a tunable length scale, paving the way for designing turbulent flows with adjustable levels of intermittency.</description>

      <title>Capillary waves in miscible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of capillary waves propagating along the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a wavenumber independent of frequency, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to an unexpected capillary-wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square gradient theories.</description>
