      <title>RNAGenScape: Property-guided Optimization and Interpolation of mRNA Sequences with Manifold Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning. Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous, data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.</description>

      <title>CT-Less Attenuation Correction Using Multiview Ensemble Conditional Diffusion Model on High-Resolution Uncorrected PET Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an average error of (1.48 $\pm$ 0.68)\% across all regions of interest when comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated pseudo-CT versus the true CT.</description>

      <title>General Microstructure Factor Analysis of Diffusion MRI in Gray-Matter Predicts Cognitive Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI has revealed important insights into white matter microstructure, but its application to gray matter remains comparatively less explored. Here, we investigate whether global patterns of gray-matter microstructure can be captured through neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and whether such patterns are predictive of cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate that PCA-based global indicators of gray-matter microstructure provide complementary markers of structure-function relationships, extending beyond region-specific analyses. Our results suggest that general microstructure factors may serve as robust, interpretable biomarkers for studying cognition and cortical organization at the population level. Using diffusion MRI and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult study, we derived region-averaged NODDI parameters and applied principal component analysis (PCA) to construct general gray-matter microstructure factors. We found that the factor derived from isotropic volume fraction explained substantial inter-individual variability and was significantly correlated with specific cognitive scores collected from the NIH Toolbox. In particular, the isotropic volume fraction factor was linked to reading and vocabulary performance and to cognitive fluidity.</description>

      <title>scMRDR: A scalable and flexible framework for unpaired single-cell multi-omics data integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in single-cell sequencing have enabled high-resolution profiling of diverse molecular modalities, while integrating unpaired multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging. Existing approaches either rely on pair information or prior correspondences, or require computing a global pairwise coupling matrix, limiting their scalability and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and flexible generative framework called single-cell Multi-omics Regularized Disentangled Representations (scMRDR) for unpaired multi-omics integration. Specifically, we disentangle each cell's latent representations into modality-shared and modality-specific components using a well-designed $\beta$-VAE architecture, which are augmented with isometric regularization to preserve intra-omics biological heterogeneity, adversarial objective to encourage cross-modal alignment, and masked reconstruction loss strategy to address the issue of missing features across modalities. Our method achieves excellent performance on benchmark datasets in terms of batch correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation. Crucially, it scales effectively to large-level datasets and supports integration of more than two omics, offering a powerful and flexible solution for large-scale multi-omics data integration and downstream biological discovery.</description>

      <title>Stress distribution in contractile cell monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behaviors in cellular systems are regulated not only by biochemical signalling pathways but also by intercellular mechanical forces, whose quantification in contractile monolayers remains poorly understood. Here, by integrating traction force microscopy and numerical simulations, we reconstruct the stress distribution in C2C12 myoblast monolayers to reveal the roles of local mechanical forces in determining the collective cellular structures. We find that contractile monolayers exhibit positive maximum and negative minimum principal stresses, reflecting the intrinsic anisotropy of active tension. Distinct stress patterns emerge around topological defects, coinciding with singularities in cell alignment, density, and morphology, indicating a strong coupling between mechanical forces and structural organization. Moreover, tensile stresses are preferentially transmitted along the cell elongation axis and compressive stresses transversely, demonstrating that local stress guides cell arrangement. This mechanical guidance appears to be universal among contractile systems, as observed also in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Together, our work establishes a quantitative framework for characterizing mechanical anisotropy in active cellular monolayers and reveals a general principle of force-structure coupling, providing a physical basis for understanding how mechanics governs myogenesis, morphogenesis, and collective organization in contractile cellular systems.</description>

      <title>geohabnet: An R package for mapping habitat connectivity for biosecurity and conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping habitat quality, based on factors like host availability and environmental suitability, is a common approach to determining which locations are important for the spread of a species. Mapping habitat connectivity takes geographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations in biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with high habitat quality may play a minor role in species spread if they are geographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat quality may play a major role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that would otherwise be physically fragmented.
  Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential importance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat availability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat connectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or pollinators.
  geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network centrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples using geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in Africa and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply geohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated importance of geographic locations for species spread.
  geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to quantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic scales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science, and conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary pathogens, pests, or endangered species.</description>

      <title>iBitter-Stack: A Multi-Representation Ensemble Learning Model for Accurate Bitter Peptide Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of bitter peptides is crucial in various domains, including food science, drug discovery, and biochemical research. These peptides not only contribute to the undesirable taste of hydrolyzed proteins but also play key roles in physiological and pharmacological processes. However, experimental methods for identifying bitter peptides are time-consuming and expensive. With the rapid expansion of peptide sequence databases in the post-genomic era, the demand for efficient computational approaches to distinguish bitter from non-bitter peptides has become increasingly significant. In this study, we propose a novel stacking-based ensemble learning framework aimed at enhancing the accuracy and reliability of bitter peptide classification. Our method integrates diverse sequence-based feature representations and leverages a broad set of machine learning classifiers. The first stacking layer comprises multiple base classifiers, each trained on distinct feature encoding schemes, while the second layer employs logistic regression to refine predictions using an eight-dimensional probability vector. Extensive evaluations on a carefully curated dataset demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing predictive methods, providing a robust and reliable computational tool for bitter peptide identification. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 96.09\% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9220 on the independent test set, underscoring its effectiveness and generalizability. To facilitate real-time usage and broader accessibility, we have also developed a user-friendly web server based on the proposed method, which is freely accessible at https://ibitter-stack-webserver.streamlit.app/. This tool enables researchers and practitioners to conveniently screen peptide sequences for bitterness in real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence of Apex-Hypha Interactions During Vegetative Growth of Fungal Thallus via Comprehensive Network and Trajectory Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mycelium of a filamentous fungus is a growing, branching network of numerous entangled hyphae exhibiting polarised apical growth. Expansion occurs during the vegetative phase from a single ascospore, driven by the need to explore and occupy surrounding space-limiting competitors, enhancing nutrient uptake, and promoting spore dispersal. Radial, rapid, and rectilinear growth combined with frequent branching appears adaptive. However, passive growth without interactions or feedback may produce suboptimal networks, as neither local density nor potential connectivity is considered. Reorientations of the apex near existing hyphae suggest apex-hypha feedback. Yet, the diversity of behaviours, spontaneous fluctuations, and limited apical trajectories studied leave open the question of active regulation. To investigate possible apex-hypha interactions, we analyse a dataset of Podospora anserina thallus growth by reconstructing all apical trajectories post-branching and fitting them with a classical Langevin model that incorporates potential interactions. Comparing isolated and non-isolated hyphae trajectories allows to identify a clear signature of interaction composed of abrupt deceleration and reorientation. This work opens the path towards a systematic exploration of hyphal interactions.</description>

      <title>A PBN-RL-XAI Framework for Discovering a "Hit-and-Run" Therapeutic Strategy in Melanoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10136v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>Pearl: A Foundation Model for Placing Every Atom in the Right Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data, inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues, we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3) controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating accurate (RMSD &lt; 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold 3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers $3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug targets at the more rigorous RMSD &lt; 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in training.</description>
