      <title>A Bioinformatic Study of Genetics Involved in Determining Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Severity and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aim: This in silico study sought to identify specific biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) through the analysis of publicly available gene and miRNA databases, hypothesizing their influence on neuronal structure, axonal integrity, and regeneration. Methods: This study implemented a three-step process: (1) Data searching for mTBI-related genes in Gene and MalaCard databases and literature review ; (2) Data analysis involved performing functional annotation through GO and KEGG, identifying hub genes using Cytoscape, mapping protein-protein interactions via DAVID and STRING, and predicting miRNA targets using miRSystem, miRWalk2.0, and mirDIP (3) RNA-sequencing analysis applied to the mTBI dataset GSE123336. Results: Eleven candidate hub genes associated with mTBI outcome were identified: APOE, S100B, GFAP, BDNF, AQP4, COMT, MBP, UCHL1, DRD2, ASIC1, and CACNA1A. Enrichment analysis linked these genes to neuron projection regeneration and synaptic plasticity. miRNAs linked to the mTBI candidate genes were hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-204-5p, hsa-miR-1908-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-10a-5p, has-miR-218-5p, has-miR-34a-5p, and has-miR-199b-5p. The RNA sequencing revealed 2664 differentially expressed miRNAs post-mTBI, with 17 showing significant changes at the time of injury and 48 hours post-injury. Two miRNAs were positively correlated with direct head hits. Conclusion: Our study indicates that specific genes and miRNAs, particularly hsa-miR-10a-5p, may influence mTBI outcomes. Our research may guide future mTBI diagnostics, emphasizing the need to measure and track these specific genes and miRNAs in diverse cohorts.</description>

      <title>OmicsCL: Unsupervised Contrastive Learning for Cancer Subtype Discovery and Survival Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.</description>
