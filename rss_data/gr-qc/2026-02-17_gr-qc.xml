      <title>Symmetric teleparallel gravitational effects on solar neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations probe the quantum gravity interface in unique ways. While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Self-Similar Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric, self-similar wormhole solutions supported by colliding streams of negative-energy null dust, and their dynamical formation. Under the assumption of self-similarity, the Einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations, which we solve numerically under boundary conditions enforcing the existence of a minimal areal radius (the throat) on constant-time hypersurfaces. For a sufficiently large throat radius, the resulting geometries remain regular at both spatial and future null infinity, while a singularity is retained in the past direction. We then construct a dynamical formation scenario by patching together three regions: a Schwarzschild black hole, negative-energy Vaidya spacetimes, and the self-similar wormhole geometry. These regions are joined across null shells using the Barrabes--Israel formalism, which provides explicit relations among the throat radius, the black hole's mass and the energy injection by the shell, demonstrating that an initial black hole can evolve into a wormhole. Our analysis generalizes the formation model for static wormhole solutions proposed by Hayward and Koyama in 2004 to non-static wormhole solutions, offering a novel perspective on the formation of regular traversable wormholes.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Analysis on Correlation for Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds of Arbitrary Polarization from Interfering Sources in Generic Dispersion Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation serves as the fundamental benchmark for detecting the gravitational-wave background (GWB) in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) within General Relativity (GR). However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric black holes in Gravity from Entropy and spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate static and dynamical spherically symmetric black hole solutions within the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) framework. We derive and solve the modified vacuum field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, revealing that the classical Schwarzschild geometry receives perturbative corrections scaling as $r^{-4}$. We establish that the GfE framework is consistent with current strong-field astrophysical observations. Higher-order geometric stresses inherent to the GfE vacuum drive a consistent mass-evolution profile. In the limit of large black hole mass, the theory predicts a constant background evaporation rate $ -\beta/24$, suggesting an inherent "entropic leakage" of the vacuum. At intermediate scales, the framework replicates the standard Hawking radiation mass-loss law as $\dot{M} \propto M^{-2}$ through a purely classical response of the modified background.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Accelerating Nonlinear $f(T)$ Gravity Models via Hybrid Scale Factor: Cosmological Dynamics and Bayesian Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study offers a comprehensive reconstruction of $f(T)$ gravity model with three distinct non-linear as well as novel forms employing a hybrid scale factor to depict the expansion history of the universe starting from early decelerated epoch to late-time accelerated evolution. Model parameters are rigorously constrained using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis with the help of Bayesian statistics and incorporating late-time observations from BAO and Patheon+SH0ES. The investigation of dynamical parameters such as the equation of state parameter and cosmological parameters indicates alignment with an accelerated expansion phase in both the present and late time epochs. Validation is conducted by assessing the energy conditions, verifying the feasibility of the model forms with particular emphasis on the violation of the strong energy condition that indicates dark energy dominance in modified gravity scenarios. This investigation has been instrumental in determining models that remain consistent with cosmological observations and theoretical requirements. The reconstructed forms of the model effectively mimic $\Lambda$CDM at late times, providing significant insights into possible extensions of general relativity and bolstering $f(T)$ gravity theory as a robust explanation for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Bounding the graviton mass using non-linear density wave theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use the Newtonian gravitational potential corrected by non-liner effects to obtain new bounds on graviton mass using non-linear density wave theory (NLDW). This potential differs from the gravitational potential obtained in other modified gravity theories (e.g. the weak field limit of Yukawa gravity, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, non-local theories, $\Lambda$ cold dark matter..). Using this model, we are able to define wavelength of the non-linear wave as an analytical solution of integrable non-linear differential equation (namely, non-linear Schrodinger equation). Assuming that the wavelength of the non-linear wave represents the graviton Compton wavelength, we have found the corresponding upper bound of graviton mass. We compare obtained result with first assessments of LIGO $\&amp;$ Virgo collaboration and we find they are in a good agreement. Present model used to determine the upper limit of graviton mass is completely independent from other methods published until now. We have compared our result with results obtained using several chosen published methods.</description>

      <title>Hidden Conformal Symmetry and Emergent Holographic Structure in the AdS Teo Rotating Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scalar perturbations of the rotating Teo wormhole embedded in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and demonstrate that the radial Klein Gordon equation exhibits an emergent conformal structure. The smooth traversable throat induces a logarithmic tortoise coordinate that allows the radial equation to be recast as the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue equation, paralleling the hidden conformal symmetry of the rotating Kerr black hole but arising here in a horizonless geometry. The AdS-Teo spacetime possesses two disconnected timelike AdS conformal boundaries that remain causally connected through the wormhole throat, in contrast to the two-sided eternal AdS black hole where horizons play a central role. Using the emergent conformal symmetry, we construct the near-throat generators, derive the effective potential, and obtain a discrete quasinormal-mode spectrum determined by regularity at the throat and standard AdS boundary conditions at infinity. The AdS embedding further enables a minimal holographic interpretation. As an explicit illustration, we compute an equal-time two-point function in the large-Delta (geodesic) limit from a regulated spacelike geodesic that traverses the wormhole, showing how the bulk geometry couples the two asymptotic boundaries. Together, these results provide a unified description of hidden conformal structure, spectral properties, and boundary correlators in a rotating, horizonless asymptotically AdS wormhole.</description>

      <title>Torsion-Induced Quantum Fluctuations in Metric-Affine Gravity using the Stochastic Variational Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review paper comprehensively examines the influence of spatial torsion on quantum fluctuations from the perspectives of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) and the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM). We first outline the fundamental framework of MAG, a generalized theory that includes both torsion and non-metricity, and discuss the geometrical significance of torsion within this context. Subsequently, we summarize SVM, a powerful technique that facilitates quantization while effectively incorporating geometrical effects. By integrating these frameworks, we evaluate how the geometrical structures originating from torsion affect quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that they induce non-linearity in quantum mechanics. Notably, torsion, traditionally believed to influence only spin degrees of freedom, can also affect spinless degrees of freedom via quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, extending beyond the results of previous work [Koide and van de Venn, Phys. Rev. A112, 052217 (2025)], we investigate the competitive interplay between the Levi-Civita curvature and torsion within the non-linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation. Finally, we discuss the structural parallelism between SVM and information geometry, highlighting that the splitting of time derivatives in stochastic processes corresponds to the dual connections in statistical manifolds. These insights pave the way for future extensions to gravity theories involving non-metricity and are expected to deepen our understanding of unresolved cosmological problems.</description>

      <title>The Theoretical Landscape of Mimetic Gravity: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mimetic gravity has emerged as a compelling extension of General Relativity (GR), originally motivated by the attempt to isolate the conformal degree of freedom of the gravitational field. By reparametrizing the physical metric in terms of an auxiliary metric and a scalar field, the theory naturally gives rise to a longitudinal degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of cold dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical landscape of mimetic gravity and its multifaceted applications to cosmology and high-energy physics. We begin by examining the original formulation and addressing the fundamental question of its equivalence to GR, highlighting how a singular disformal transformation introduces new physical degrees of freedom. We then explore minimal generalizations that lead to unified cosmological models, including mimetic matter scenarios and extensions into $f(R, \phi)$ gravity, which allow for the reconstruction of any desired expansion history. Significant attention is given to the ``limiting curvature'' hypothesis through $f(\Box \phi)$ modifications, providing a classical mechanism for resolving cosmological and black hole singularities. We critically assess the challenges facing the theory, specifically the gradient and ghost instabilities identified in cosmological perturbations, and discuss modern resolutions such as ghost-free mimetic massive gravity and covariant formulations of Ho\v{r}ava gravity. Finally, we discuss the role of the mimetic field in the early universe, specifically in the context of asymptotically free gravity and the resolution of the self-reproduction problem in inflation.</description>

      <title>On the Cuspy Structure of Rotating Wormhole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow cast by a rotating traversable wormhole in the Teo class endowed with a general redshift function, with particular emphasis on the emergence of cuspy structures. The shadow boundary is the common envelope of two critical orbit families: unstable circular orbits outside the throat and orbits at the throat itself. The formation of cusps, marking the transition between smooth and cuspy shadow boundaries, only becomes possible when the redshift parameter $\lambda$ is allowed to vary. Moreover, we uncover a universal critical value $\lambda_c$ that signals the onset of the cusp. A phase diagram characterized by the spin and redshift parameters reveals four distinct morphologies: smooth, cuspy, ears touching, and throat drowning. The morphology of the wormhole shadow may provide observational diagnostics for the different compact objects in future high-resolution imaging observations.</description>

      <title>The initial states of high frequency gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After distinguishing the role of classical and quantum inhomogeneities in cosmological backgrounds, we constrain the initial states of the relic gravitons as soon as the different wavelengths of the spectrum cross the comoving Hubble radius, without any reference to earlier timescales. According to this pragmatic perspective the quantum states with finite energy density at the crossing time consistently affect the two-point functions and the related power spectra. An initial state different from the vacuum turns out to be marginally permitted in the low frequency range (associated with the largest observable wavelengths that crossed the comoving Hubble radius) while the intermediate and high frequency domains of the spectrum are populated by the gravitons produced from the vacuum. The non classical correlations are expected to dominate between the kHz and the THz since in this region gravitons are produced quantum mechanically with a negligible contribution from the initial state.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda(t)$CDM Model: Cosmological Implications and Dynamical System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated a time-varying cosmological constant model using recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, combined with Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon$^{+}$, DES-Dovekie, and Union3) and CMB shift parameters, to constrain the $\Lambda(t)$CDM model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. We find that the interaction term $Q(z)$ shows a sign change for all dataset combinations by crossing $Q(z)=0$, depending on the choice of the dataset: at low redshift $Q(z)&lt;0$, indicating vacuum energy decaying into dark matter, while at high redshift $Q(z)&gt;0$, corresponding to dark matter decaying into vacuum energy. The dynamical system analysis found three critical points, namely $P_1,P_2$, and $P_3$ respectively. The resulting critical points, determined by the underlying cosmological parameters, correspond to distinct epochs in cosmic evolution. Depending on the parameter combinations, these points characterize various cosmological phases, ranging from an accelerated stiff matter-dominated era to late-time accelerated expansion. The stability of each critical point is analyzed using linear stability theory, with the relevant physical constraints on the cosmological parameters duly incorporated throughout the analysis. For each dataset combinations, the $\Lambda(t)$CDM model predicts that $\omega_0 &gt; -1$, showing a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant scenario with $\omega_0 = -1$. Consequently, the model exhibits a transition phase in the range $N \equiv \log a(t) \approx -0.51$ to $-0.48$ and predicts $q_0$ in the range $-0.54$ to $-0.52$, with the precise transition point depending on the choice of dataset. Finally, the Bayesian evidence shows strong support for the $\Lambda(t)$CDM model over $\Lambda$CDM</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Effects in Quantum Field Theory: Hamiltonian constraint Generates Gravity-Matter Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a foundational challenge in quantum field theory on curved spacetime by developing a consistent framework within loop quantum gravity. We introduce a methodology for defining meaningful superpositions of quantum geometry and matter states. This is achieved by identifying a restricted subspace of the gravitational phase space, which ensures unitary equivalence among Fock representations of a scalar field across different quantum geometries. Within the resulting well-defined state space, we derive weak solutions to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. Furthermore, we generalize the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state to this quantum geometric framework. The resulting state exhibits the inherent entanglement between geometry and matter, which arises from the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. This work establishes a principled framework for studying geometry-matter entanglement and offers new insights into the quantum foundations of the black hole information paradox.</description>

      <title>Local Short-Time Acceleration and deSitter Spacetime induced Extra Spectral Broadening: a Simple Interpretation of Modified Inertial in MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel quantum effect wherein particle spectra show extra broadening due to local short-time acceleration (as well as in a deSitter spacetime background). This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent.</description>

      <title>The initial data of effective field theories of relativistic viscous fluids and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been recent progress in developing well-posed theories of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and of gravitational effective field theories. These have in common the feature that they introduce unphysical degrees of freedom. We address the problem of how these should be treated. We propose a ''reduction of order'' approach which is applied not at the level of equations of motion but only to initial data. This specifies uniquely the data for the unphysical modes in terms of the data for the physical modes. We argue that the apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance associated with this approach is not a problem provided one restricts to Lorentz frames for which the assumptions of effective field theory are manifestly valid.</description>

      <title>Investigating the impact of quasi-universal relations on neutron star constraints in third-generation detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems can shed light on the currently unknown dense matter equation of state. The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Invariant Formulation of CP Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a fundamental tension between the standard formulation of CP violation and diffeomorphism invariance in general relativity. The effective Hamiltonian approach, while phenomenologically successful, relies on a preferred time foliation that is incompatible with general covariance. The CP-violating phases are scalars along the worldline of the decaying parent particle; however, the definition of masses and phases presupposes a local covariant structure, which becomes ill-defined near the origin where curvature is large and metric fluctuations become significant. We propose an information-geometric framework based on relative entropy, exploiting pure quantum states in particle and antiparticle Hilbert spaces. We show how the Sakharov conditions could be reinterpreted in terms of information-geometric quantities, although a fully rigorous phenomenological implementation remains to be developed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize our previous theorem for FLRW spacetime within the framework of generic metric gravity theories. In our earlier work, we demonstrated that, in the absence of matter fields, the field equations of any generic gravity theory reduce to the Einstein field equations with an effective perfect fluid source. In the present study, we extend this analysis by incorporating scalar and vector fields into a generic gravity theory and show that the resulting field equations remain equivalent to the Einstein field equations with a perfect fluid distribution. We further verify our findings by explicitly examining recently developed Einstein-scalar and Einstein-Proca field theories.</description>

      <title>Tarnished by Tools: Cost of Systematics in Golden Dark Siren Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Golden dark sirens - exceptionally well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts - offer a powerful route to precision measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, with next-generation (XG) detectors. The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\mathcal{O}(\rho^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era.</description>

      <title>On a G\"odel-like Solution in Non-Relativistic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article deals with G\"odel-like solutions in the context of Galilean gravity, a geometric formulation of non-relativistic gravitation defined on a five-dimensional Galilean manifold. Within this framework, non-relativistic matter fields admit a covariant description, while the physical Newtonian dynamics is recovered through an immersion into the usual $3+1$ spacetime. By adopting a G\"odel-like metric ansatz and coupling the gravitational field to a Galilean fluid derived from a variational principle, we obtain a system of highly nonlinear and coupled field equations. Exact solutions are constructed by fixing the matter sector consistently with the field equations. The resulting configurations describe rotating non-relativistic universes and satisfy $D(x)&gt;H(x)$ throughout the entire spatial domain. As a consequence, the associated Killing vector remains spacelike everywhere and no closed timelike curves arise.</description>

      <title>Modern tidal interaction models for rapid binary population synthesis: I. Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an updated prescription of contemporary tidal dissipation theory adapted for rapid binary population synthesis. Our simplified expressions encode the dependence of tidal dissipation on stellar structure, stratification, and tidal forcing frequency, while remaining computationally efficient. We implement these prescriptions in the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS, and demonstrate the self-consistent coupling of tides with stellar evolution and binary properties such as orbital periods, spins, and eccentricities for several representative binary systems. When compared with commonly used tidal prescriptions, our equilibrium tidal dissipation efficiencies can be stronger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low mass main sequence and giant type stars, and dynamical tides can be stronger by 1-7 orders of magnitude due to the explicit dependence on internal stellar structure and the presence of inertial wave dissipation. Despite our simplistic approach, our models agree with detailed stellar simulations to within an order of magnitude across tidal dissipation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Conformal Killing Tensors, Noether Currents and Higher-Spin Shift Symmetries in (A)dS Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For certain mass values, shift symmetries appear among massive higher spin fields propagating on (anti-) de Sitter spacetime. On the one hand, Noether's theorem assigns a set of conserved currents for each shift symmetric field, one current for each of the independent shift symmetries. On the other hand, each shift symmetric field comes with a higher-rank conserved field strength that can be contracted with a conformal Killing tensor (CKT) to form another set of conserved currents, one for each independent CKT. This second set is naively much larger than the first. We conjecture, and prove in the first few cases, that these two sets are the same once we account for the redundancy due to trivial currents that is implicit in Noether's theorem. For each field, only one branch of the CKTs is non-trivial. As we range over all the mass values and spins of the shift symmetric fields, each kind of CKT gets used exactly once in a non-trivial current.</description>

      <title>Sign-Switching Dark Energy: Smooth Transitions with Recent \textit{DESI DR2} Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign-switching dark energy provides a novel mechanism for modifying the late-time expansion history of the Universe without invoking additional fields or finely tuned initial conditions. In this work, we investigate a class of background--level cosmological models in which the dark energy contribution changes sign at a transition redshift $z_\dagger$, producing a sharp deviation from standard $\Lambda$CDM dynamics. We confront these models with a comprehensive set of cosmological observations, including \textit{Planck 18} cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements, \textit{\textit{DESI DR2}} Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data and the \textit{Pantheon+} $\&amp;$ \textit{SH0ES} Type Ia supernova sample (SN). Using a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we find that the sign-switching scenario significantly alleviates the Hubble tension while obtaining better results when statistically comparing with $\Lambda$CDM, as quantified by the Akaike and Bayesian information Criteria. Although the model is explored only at the background level, the improvement in the inferred Hubble constant demonstrates that sign-switching dark energy offers a promising and physically economical pathway toward resolving late-universe discrepancies.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a definition of strong hyperbolicity for second order partial differential equations using second order pencils. We show that this definition is equivalent to the standard one, derived by reducing the equations to first order form, but with the benefit of simplifying the calculations necessary to check hyperbolicity. In addition, we observe an interesting property, namely that when a system is strongly hyperbolic, its second order pencil can be factorized as a product of two diagonalizable first order pencils. Finally, we present an application to a vector potential for of Maxwell's equations, with a general extension and gauge fixing.</description>

      <title>Physical Predictions in Closed Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in gravitational path integrals indicate that the nonperturbative physical Hilbert space of a closed universe is one-dimensional within each superselection sector. This raises a basic puzzle: how can a unique quantum-gravity state give rise to semiclassical physics, measurement outcomes, and classical probabilities? In this paper, we develop a framework in which nontrivial and statistically stable predictions emerge despite the one-dimensionality of the fully constrained Hilbert space. The key idea is to extract physical predictions in an enlarged, unconstrained Hilbert space by conditioning on observational data. We show that partial observability -- reflecting the limited access of observers to the degrees of freedom of the universe -- suppresses ensemble fluctuations associated with microscopic structure in the gravitational path integral, thereby restoring semiclassical predictability with exponential accuracy. We formulate the construction explicitly including contributions from the Hartle--Hawking no-boundary state, define a gauge-invariant Hilbert space for observations via a density operator, and generalize the formalism to conditioning on histories, clarifying the emergence of classical probabilities and an effective arrow of time. Finally, we explore whether this framework can support a realistic cosmology and identify assumptions that the underlying theory of quantum gravity must satisfy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold dark matter may be a fluid (or plasma) residing in a strongly-interacting hidden sector, rather than a population of weakly-coupled particles. Such a scenario admits a holographic description in terms of a cosmological braneworld embedded in the linear dilaton five-dimensional (5D) spacetime. In this framework, dark matter originates from the linear dilaton bulk black hole, whose phase we show to be thermodynamically favored at all temperatures. We present a natural freeze-in mechanism for the production of holographic dark matter, in which the bulk black hole is fed by energy leaking from the brane after inflation. Our model is characterized by two free parameters, one of which, the position of the black hole horizon, is fixed by the observed dark matter abundance. The remaining parameter, the 5D Planck scale $M_5$, is consistent with all current experimental bounds provided that $M_5\gtrsim 3\times 10^5$ TeV.</description>

Abstract: Effective Field Theories with higher derivatives often yield equations of motion which define ill-posed problems. We present a method for enhancing control on such theories by coupling them to a field living in one extra dimension. The resulting action principle helps to define a well-posed problem introducing a mechanism to control UV behavior. Physically this is achieved by dissipating the energy in the short-wavelength modes into the extra dimension. We examine the resulting dynamics and compare it to alternative proposals for studying such theories in the non-linear regime.</description>

      <title>Making Symmetry Explicit: The Limits of Sophistication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is often treated in philosophy of physics as an interpretive problem. A particularly lively dispute concerns local symmetries: do they indicate surplus structure that ought to be expunged, or are they merely a harmless redundancy? One influential response favours the second option for certain theories -- those dubbed internally sophisticated. And indeed, in much of physics practice, local symmetries are left implicit: one simply works "up to isomorphism'' without pausing over invariance. But not always. In some settings, local symmetry and invariance become pressing practical concerns for physicists. Yet philosophical discussions of sophistication have paid little sustained attention to when, and why, this happens.
  Surveying textbook general relativity (GR) and gauge theory, I identify the settings in which diffeomorphism invariance or gauge invariance must be handled explicitly. (Here a setting is a choice of representational framework or background assumptions within which one formulates and uses the theory -- for instance, linearisation, an initial-value formulation, or a Hamiltonian $3+1$ formalism.) I propose an operational criterion -- background-relative sophistication (BRS) -- and argue that it accounts well for the pattern: it marks just where symmetry can stay implicit and where it must be made explicit. Quantum and subsystem settings raise a further difficulty: there, certain tasks (superposition and gluing) force symmetry into view even for theories that are BRS.</description>

      <title>Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity from Holonomies: Discrete BF Formulation and Boundary Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully discrete and non-perturbative formulation of two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the BF framework. Using group-valued holonomies and Lie-algebra--valued dilatons, the bulk theory is shown to be purely topological, with all physical information encoded at the boundary. We analyze admissible discrete boundary conditions and derive the corresponding asymptotic symmetry algebras directly at the lattice level, including an affine Kac-Moody symmetry and its Brown-Henneaux reduction to a Virasoro algebra, together with the associated Virasoro-dilaton structure. A precise operator product expansion (OPE) dictionary is established by taking the controlled continuum limit of the discrete Poisson brackets. Beyond asymptotic symmetries, we provide an effective boundary description and a representation-theoretic quantization organized by monodromy sectors. Within this discrete framework, black hole entropy follows from gauge-invariant holonomy data and is expressed in terms of the dilaton Casimir, reproducing the Bekenstein--Hawking result without invoking a fundamental Schwarzian action.</description>

      <title>Effects of the symmetry energy slope on magnetized neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of the symmetry slope on the observables of weakly and strongly magnetized neutron stars within the chaotic magnetic field approximation. We investigate the impact of the symmetry energy slope in the equation of state, as well as on the observables of neutron stars, by calculating their masses, radii, redshifts, tidal deformabilities, and fundamental-mode gravitational-wave frequencies.</description>

      <title>Quintessence with tachyonic resonance and late-time cosmic-microwave-background and gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinations of recent cosmological observations, including Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), show hints of a dynamical nature for dark energy. While the data suggest the possibility of the phantom crossing, it is worth thoroughly exploring quintessence models. Given that phenomenological parametrisations of the equation-of-state parameter $w(a)$ with a sharp transitional feature fit the data well, we study the realisation of such models in quintessence. In the late Universe, the quintessence field begins to oscillate abruptly, changing the behaviour of $w$. Naturally, such a model entails tachyonic instability, and particle production modifies $w$. We perform numerical lattice simulations to study the time dependence of $w$. In addition, the violent particle production produces significant density perturbations and the stochastic gravitational-wave background, whose characteristic scale depends on the mass scale of the quintessence around the minimum of the potential. We discuss the observability of these late-time cosmological signals through cosmic microwave background, quasar astrometry, pulsar timing arrays, and other observational probes.</description>

      <title>Holographic Subregion Complexity and Fidelity Susceptibility in Noncommutative Yang--Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of holographic subregion complexity (HSC) and holographic fidelity susceptibility (HFS) in noncommutative Yang--Mills theory. The emergence of a minimum length scale, dictated by the degree of noncommutativity, induces a behavioral transition in the HSC and establishes a lower bound. In the large noncommutativity regime, the qualitative features of the complexity deviate significantly from the commutative case. The HFS is shown to provide an effective measure of the degree of noncommutativity. Although the HSC generally satisfies strong subadditivity, this property fails abruptly when the subregion size approaches the minimum length scale. At finite temperature, the long-range behavior of the HSC is modified, and its lower bound scales positively with temperature. Furthermore, temperature enhances the sensitivity of the fidelity susceptibility to the degree of noncommutativity. Within the AdS soliton background, a competition between connected and disconnected configurations arises in the HSC, signaling a phase-transition-like behavior. Finally, the compactification scale is found to diminish the sensitivity of the HFS to the degree of noncommutativity.</description>

      <title>Circular orbits and observational features of the rotating Simpson-Visser black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the radiative properties and optical appearance of rotating SV black holes surrounded by a thin accretion disks, and mainly analyze the influence of the regularization parameter $g$ on related observables. The results show that although the kinetic quantities and the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) depend on the regularization parameter $g$, the radiative efficiency of the rotating SV black hole is the same as its Kerr counterpart. Within the Novikov-Thorne thin-disk model, the radiative flux, effective temperature, and spectral luminosity are studied, and by adopting observational parameters relevant to SgrA* and M87*, concrete examples of the rotating SV black holes are calculated and compared with that of the Kerr black holes. The results show that the parameter $g$ suppresses the maximum values of these quantities. In addition, using a backward ray-tracing technique, we numerically simulate the optical appearance of rotating SV black holes and analyze the corresponding intensity images, redshift and observed flux distributions. Our results show that these quantities are affected by $g$. In particular, as $g$ increases, the observed intensity is significantly suppressed and the photon ring region has remarkable increase in its width. Our findings suggest that accretion-disk-related observables may provide important avenues to distinguish rotating SV black holes and Kerr black holes, and offer theoretical guidance for future high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Matching conditions for scattering solutions of scalar wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scattering solutions $\phi$ of the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetimes, satisfying the following properties: i) $\phi$ attains a prescribed radiation field $\psi_{\mathcal{I}}$ through future null infinity, which decays at an inverse polynomial rate; ii) $\phi$ is regular in the exterior region up to and including the future event horizon, i.e. $\phi\in C^N$, where $N\gg1$ is independent of the decay rate of $\psi_{\mathcal{I}}$. We prove that such solutions exist for arbitrary $N$, and that they are not unique. The proof consists of: 1) finding an approximate solution $\phi_{\mathrm{app}}$ with fast decaying error; 2) the use of backwards energy estimates in order to correct $\phi_{\mathrm{app}}$ to an exact solution. Extremality is used only in the second step. The methods of the linear case described above are then used to show the same results for semilinear equations where the nonlinearity satisfies the null condition, as well as to geometries describing the hyperbolic orbit of multiple extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Lorentz invariance violation from muon fluctuations at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity theories often modify spacetime symmetries. In particular, Lorentz invariance may be violated when approaching the Planck scale. Although the scales at which interactions occur in extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere are many orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, these violations might still be observable. In this work, the fluctuations in the number of muons in the extensive air showers measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory are exploited, for the first time, to constrain Lorentz invariance violations. The bounds derived in the hadronic sector are the strongest ever obtained, and do not rely on assumptions about the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The fluctuations in the number of muons constitute a new and powerful observable to further explore Lorentz invariance in a region of the parameter space not accessible to other observables.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-minimal coupling using ultra-diffuse galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC\;1052-DF2, NGC\;1052-DF4, and Dragonfly\;44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems.</description>

      <title>On the Unitarity of the Gravitational S-Matrix in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that for finite energy windows, the final states in gravitational scattering in dimension $d &gt; 4$ are normalizable coherent states in Fock space. However, as the center of the energy window goes to infinity, black hole physics predicts that these states become orthogonal to every state with a finite number of particles. Given that the spectral measure in energy is determined by Poincare invariance, the S-matrix cannot be a unitary operator in Fock space, despite having finite matrix elements in Fock space, and satisfying perturbative unitarity, to all orders in string perturbation theory. We identify regimes in the BFSS matrix model\cite{bfss} and the definition of the S-matrix as the limit of CFT correlators\cite{polchsuss}, which point to the same conclusion. We review a scattering theory based on the quantum mechanics of a finite number of fermionic oscillators, whose algebra formally converges to the Super-Poincare covariant Awada-Gibbons-Shaw\cite{ags} algebra, and argue that a certain class of limiting states on that algebra satisfy all the properties required by physical unitarity in the algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics. The only missing ingredient for a consistent theory is a proof that the S matrix amplitudes themselves are Poincare invariant. We provide suggestive arguments, but no real proof, that this is so.</description>

      <title>Assumptions of Randomness in Cosmology Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:1707.03262v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-compact symmetries cannot be fully broken by randomness since non-compact groups have no invariant probability distributions. In particular, this makes trickier the "Copernican" random choice of the place of the observer in infinite cosmology models.
  This problem may be circumvented with what topologists call pointed spaces. Then randomness will be used only in building (infinite) models around the pre-designated "observation point", that thus would not need to be randomly chosen.
  Additional complications come from the original randomness possibly being hidden. P. Gacs and A. Kucera proved that every sequence can be algorithmically generated from a random one. But Vladimir V'yugin discovered that randomized algorithms can with positive probability generate uncomputable sequences that are not algorithmically equivalent to any random ones.</description>

Abstract: We numerically evolve spherically symmetric solutions to the linear wave equation on some expanding Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes and study the respective asymptotics for large times. We find a quantitative relation between the expansion rate of the underlying background universe and the decay rate of linear waves, also in the context of spatially-hyperbolic spacetimes, for which rigorous proofs of decay rates are not generally known. A prominent role in the decay mechanism is shown to be played by tails, i.e. scattered waves propagating in the interior of the lightcone.</description>

Abstract: Detections of gravitational waves (GWs) since GW150914 has gained a contemporary interest in a potential quantum-classical correspondence between GWs and hypothetical gravitons. One such correspondence theory is stochastic gravity, whereby graviton fluctuations are treated as the stochastic noise embedded in globally-flat manifolds and local gravitational interactions. Utilizing the Einstein-Langevin equation that describes graviton fluctuations, in attempt to form a correlation with GW generation, we utilize the hollow mass-shell model of coalescing compact binaries. This is to explore the second Newtonian postulate of neutralized internal gravitational fields, i.e. the stochastic noise of an enclosed, internal Minkowski manifold. This stochatic picture of GW formation implies the treatment of the enclosed gravitons as a Brownian bath. From the Einstein-Langevin equation, we establish a scaling relation where quanta dissipation depends inversely with the contracting volume (i.e., emission increases during coalescence). Using an Euler iteration scheme, we simulate the graviton fluctuations from inspiral to merger as a Wiener process, revealing a signal that qualitatively resembles macroscopic GW waveforms. While inherently heuristic and phenomenological, this approach provides a computational framework for exploring graviton-scale perturbations in GW formation. We discuss furthermore analytical waveform matching with the iteration scheme, as well as the justification of a Brownian analogy amidst current and state-of-the-art effective field theory frameworks.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Spin Hydrodynamics in Flat and Curved Spacetime: Covariance, Linear Waves, and Bjorken Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore various aspects of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics, where hydrodynamic currents are derived from an expansion in the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$, incorporating both flat and curved spacetimes. After establishing covariant definitions for angular momentum currents, we demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor requires modifications involving the Riemann curvature and the spin tensors. We also revise pseudo-gauge transformations to ensure their applicability in curved spacetimes. Key assumptions for semi-classical spin hydrodynamics are introduced, enabling studies without explicitly invoking quantum kinetic theory. We derive and analyze the linearized semi-classical spin hydrodynamic equations, proving that spin and fluid modes decouple in the linear regime. As a concrete example, we study the ideal-spin approximation in a dissipative fluid with shear viscosity. This analysis confirms our general result: the damping of spin waves is governed solely by spin relaxation time coefficients, independent of linear fluid perturbations. We also examine the Gibbs stability criterion and reveal its limitations at first order in $\hbar$, signaling the inherent anisotropy of the equilibrium state, which remains unaddressed in current semi-classical spin hydrodynamics formulations. Finally, within a conformal Bjorken flow background and using the slow-roll approximation attractor for the fluid sector, we show that the relaxation of the spin potential is governed by spin relaxation time coefficients, mirroring the damping behavior of spin waves in the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Landscapes: black holes with linear equations of state in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23193v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study black holes with linear equation of state within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. This study extends previous work on gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity (that has been done for a dust fluid) by considering into account the pressure of stellar matter. We derive modified field equations containing the running gravitational coupling and the cosmological constant as functions of energy density. The interior space-time of collapsing star is modeled by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while the exterior is described by a static spherically symmetric space-time. Different equations of state from ordinary matter to exotic phantom energy are considered to investigate their impact on black hole structure and horizon formation. Our results illustrate that asymptotically safe gravity can introduce non-singular black hole solutions under specific conditions. These results provide new insights into black hole physics and the avoidance of singularities within the asymptotically safe gravity framework.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth (Einstein frame) case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, motivated by recent results from DESI DR2 suggesting the existence of evolving/interacting dark energy, we analyze spatially flat FLRW interacting scalar-tensor cosmological models with non-minimal coupling (NMC) between the scalar field (SF) and matter/cosmological dust in the Einstein conformal frame. By using modified expansion normalized variables that account for negative values of the scalar field potential, we derive cosmological dynamical system equations and expressions for physical variables. Five specific scalar field models (axions/ALPs, cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential with a constant, quintessence, and SFDM) are examined in depth to determine how they evolve, as they are thought to represent evolving dark energy in the late Universe. Using appropriate mathematical methods (e.g. linear stability, center manifold and Poincar\'e sphere), we present critical points along with their character and physical interpretation with respect to the possible evolution of the Universe. Considering both positive and negative values of the coupling parameter allows us to examine the transfer of energy from the scalar sector to dust and from matter to the scalar field. Considering four different values of this parameter provides a comprehensive analysis that incorporates all significant types of dynamical system evolution (from mathematical and physical perspectives). The initial conditions for the in-depth numerical analysis were calculated analytically from Planck 2018 and DESI DR2 CPL parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Coherent State Description of Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is the fundamental framework of nature, and gravitational waves from binary black holes during the inspiral phase should likewise be analyzed quantum mechanically. It is commonly assumed that their classical description corresponds to a coherent state, so any deviation would signal genuinely quantum nature of gravity. We show that the coherent-state description reproduces classical gravitational waves at leading order, while next-order effects generate squeezed states of gravitons. For GW150914, we estimate the squeezing parameter to be $\sim 10^{-4}$. We find that gravitational waves from binary black holes are well described by a coherent state.</description>

      <title>New analytical model of rotating black hole with dark matter halo: constraints from EHT observations and accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we start from a static black hole (BH) immersed in a Deanne-type dark matter (DM) halo and employ the Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA) to generate the rotating black hole solution with a dark matter halo. Also, we have checked the validity of the obtained space-time. Then we study optical properties of newly obtained rotating BH in DM halo, including the shadow's geometrical shape, deflection angle of light based Ono, Ishihara and Asada (OID) method, photon sphere and the dependence of the shadow radius on DM parameters. Additionally, assuming that spacetime of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) is described by the newly obtained rotating BH solution, we analyze the parameters of the model with shadow size estimates based on the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and Gravity collaboration observations of M87* and Sgr A* SMBHs. Then we have used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain DM parameters $\rho_s$, $r_s$ and BH mass M, BH spin a, also we show that best-fit values for the parameters $\rho_s$, $r_s$ are well agreement with previous results which indicate physically reasonability of the our model. Finally, we have analyzed the electromagnetic radiation flux of the rotating BH in the DM halo employing a ray tracing code.</description>

      <title>A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass-ratio inspirals around non-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a relativistically accurate formalism to model the interaction between stellar mass compact objects embedded in thin accretion disks around a non-spinning supermassive black hole, using tools from self-force theory and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We then apply this formalism to analyze the evolution of a compact object on a nearly circular and equatorial orbit interacting with a thin equatorial disk. We provide analytic and relativistically-accurate expressions for the rates of energy and angular momentum exchanged during interactions due to Lindblad and corotation resonances. Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the magnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian expressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$ Schwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that strong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact object than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer than 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading to a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object. Finally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic torque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio inspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of using relativistically-accurate models of environmental interactions in extreme mass-ratio inspirals close to a supermassive black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the motion of a small compact object on a nearly circular orbit around a spinning supermassive black hole, which is also interacting with a thin equatorial accretion-disk surrounding the latter, through tools from self-force and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We provide an analytical and relativistically-accurate formalism to calculate the rate of energy and angular momentum exchanged at Lindblad resonances. We show that strong relativistic effects can potentially cause a reversal in the direction of the torque on the small compact object if the surface density gradient is not too large. We analytically explore the dependence of the torque reversal location on the spin of the supermassive black hole and demonstrate that the ratio of the reversal location to the innermost stable circular orbit is approximately insensitive to the spin of the supermassive black hole. Our results show that relativistic torques can be 1--2 order of magnitude larger than the Newtonian torque routinely used in the literature to model disk/small-compact-object interactions close to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of including relativistic effects when modeling environmental effects in extreme mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For a folded loop with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Black hole Candidates: A Detailed Analysis of McVittie, Culetu, Sultana-Dyer, and Glass-Mashhoon Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of cosmological black holes by analyzing the properties of trapping horizons in detail, based on Hayward's formalism of future outer and past inner trapping horizons, in several dynamical spacetimes embedded in an expanding universe. Through a detailed examination of the McVittie, Culetu, and Sultana--Dyer metrics, as well as the generalized Glass--Mashhoon solution, we evaluate the existence and characteristics of trapping horizons and energy conditions. The Glass--Mashhoon solution provides an analytical model for spherical stellar collapse. However, it is shown that, as long as certain conditions are satisfied, it lacks suitable future outer trapping horizons, meaning it does not represent a cosmological black hole. As a result, the McVittie class of solutions also fails to describe a cosmological black hole. Conversely, the Culetu and Sultana--Dyer spacetimes can describe a cosmological black hole in the matter-dominated early universe, provided that the relevant energy conditions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of Scalar Dark Matter Around Binary Neutron Star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers provide a laboratory for probing fundamental physics through their gravitational-wave emission and electromagnetic counterparts. In particular, they may allow us to explore signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model in strong-gravity regimes, such as those of dark matter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of light dark matter, modeled as a minimally coupled scalar field, surrounding a binary neutron star system. Our primary focus is to assess whether the scalar field remains bound to the binary over the late inspiral-merger timescales and to determine its potential impact on observable signatures. We find that, in a range of scenarios, the scalar field forms a common cloud around the binary that does not disperse. At sufficiently high densities, this leads to measurable effects, including a dephasing of the binary inspiral, a less compact post-merger remnant, and suppression of the dynamical ejecta. For densities motivated by astrophysical considerations, however, these effects remain small and are unlikely to be detectable with current or next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore how inflationary features shape the early stages of cosmic structure formation. Using the transfer function formalism, we trace the evolution of primordial perturbations, showing how causal physics and oscillatory signatures from inflation influence the matter power spectrum. The variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation. Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and disk properties of high-redshift systems. Our results indicate that oscillatory features from inflation can leave measurable imprints on halo abundances and early galaxy properties, providing a testable link between high-energy physics and astrophysical observations with JWST</description>

Abstract: We identify a general class of spacetime metrics that mimic the properties of black holes without possessing a true event horizon. These metrics are constrained by the requirements of being singularity-free and geodesically complete. Specifically, we study metrics that do not possess $Z_2$ symmetry and may deviate slightly or significantly from the symmetric case. Focusing on scalar perturbations propagating on such backgrounds, we analyze the resulting effective radial potentials and their dependence on different corners of the mimicker landscape. We further investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes and explore their characteristic features. Finally, we survey the landscape for potential observational signatures, including shadow properties and the possible presence or absence of echo effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes in four-dimensional, asymptotically flat general relativity have vanishing static tidal Love numbers (TLNs), a property tied to a hidden symmetry of the perturbation equations. Within the Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrization, a subclass of spacetimes was previously shown to admit such Ladder symmetry, which enforces the absence of static scalar TLNs. In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs. This establishes Ladder symmetry as a necessary, as well as sufficient condition, for the vanishing of static TLNs in static, spherically symmetric black holes and in rotating black holes of the KRZ class.</description>

Abstract: Two prescriptions for the construction of Carroll geometries, the expansion of geometric variables near horizon and the expansion of metric with zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$ (speed of light in vacuum), are known to complement each other. The entropy of an ideal gas, confined in a box and kept very close to the horizon, depends on the transverse area of the container. We show this by using the Carroll geometry constructed through the expansion of the metric and then taking the zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$. Therefore, the present analysis assures the complementing nature of two ways of finding the Carroll geometry from the thermodynamical point of view.</description>

      <title>Functional Determinants for Constrained Path Integrals in Minisuperspace Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed evaluation of constrained minisuperspace path integrals in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and in biaxial Bianchi IX quantum cosmology, employing the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem to compute the relevant functional determinants. In both settings, integrating out the dilaton or a minisuperspace variable produces a functional delta that enforces the classical constraint equation, thereby localizing the remaining path integral onto classical configurations. The associated Jacobian, equivalently, the functional determinant of the operator obtained by linearizing the constraint about the classical solution, fixes the semiclassical prefactor and the correct measure. We evaluate this determinant exactly via the Gelfand-Yaglom method and obtain the fully normalized fixed-lapse propagators. We further extend the JT analysis to a quadratic dilaton potential $U(\phi)=m^{2}\phi^{2}$ and comment on the corresponding saddle-point structure of the lapse integral. Finally, we apply the same approach to Bianchi IX quantum cosmology and derive the fixed-lapse propagator, including its prefactor. Our results provide a systematic and broadly applicable prescription for treating constraint structures in gravitational path integrals using functional determinant techniques, with potential applications to a wider class of minisuperspace quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Anisotropies in PTA Observations: Analytical Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reported evidence for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has motivated searches for extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropies. Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively. Our formulas can be used in forecasts or Bayesian analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>The measurable impact of the 2pN spin-dependent accelerations on the jet precession of M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent accurate measurements of disk/jet coprecessions around some galactic supermassive black holes, the accelerations experienced by an uncharged, spinless object in the Kerr metric, written in harmonic coordinates, are analytically calculated up to the formal second post-Newtonian order. To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\ast$ are displayed.</description>

      <title>Fate of false vacuum in non-perturbative regimes: Gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis of the false-vacuum decay in non-perturbative regimes is here extended in the presence of Einstein gravity, computing the corresponding effective potential and decay rate. We consider a $\lambda \phi^4$ scalar field theory and we observe that, in comparison to the usual perturbative decay rate, the higher the coupling $\lambda$, the greater the decay probability. We evaluate the running of the self-interaction coupling and obtain a weakly coupled theory at lower energies, proving that Einstein gravity grants an even more reliable weak coupling approximation with the universe cooling down. We also provide an extended study of a non-minimal coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field with gravity showing how this term makes the false-vacuum decay more difficult. Minima can also disappear at large coupling $\xi$. We discuss possible applications of these results to cosmological phase transitions, gravitational-wave astronomy, and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Stringent Tests of Lorentz Invariance Violation from LHAASO Observations of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On October 9, 2022, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported the observation of the very early TeV afterglow of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A, recording the highest photon statistics in the TeV band ever from a gamma-ray burst. We use this unique observation to place stringent constraints on an energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum, a manifestation of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity (QG) theories. Our results show that the 95% confidence level lower limits on the QG energy scales are $E_{\mathrm{QG},1}&gt;10$ times of the Planck energy $E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the linear, and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2}&gt;6\times10^{-8}E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the quadratic LIV effects, respectively. Our limits on the quadratic LIV case improve previous best bounds by factors of 5--7.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Relativistic Superheated Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic, charged, superheated bubbles may play an important role in neutron star mergers if first-order phase transitions are present in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics. We describe the properties of these bubbles in the hydrodynamic regime. We find two qualitative differences with supercooled bubbles. First, the pressure at the center of an expanding superheated bubble can be higher or lower than the pressure in the asymptotic, metastable phase. Second, some fluid flows develop metastable regions behind the bubble wall for any choice of the equation of state. We consider the possible role of a conserved charge akin to baryon number. The fluid flow profiles are unaffected by this charge if the speed of sound is constant in each phase, but they are modified for more general equations of state. We compute the efficiency factor relevant for gravitational wave production.</description>

      <title>A CMC existence result for expanding cosmological spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a new CMC (constant mean curvature) existence result for cosmological spacetimes, i.e., globally hyperbolic spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces satisfying the strong energy condition. If the spacetime contains an expanding Cauchy surface and is future timelike geodesically complete, then the spacetime contains a CMC Cauchy surface. This result settles, under certain circumstances, a conjecture of the authors and a conjecture of Dilts and Holst. Our proof relies on the construction of barriers in the support sense, and the CMC Cauchy surface is found as the asymptotic limit of mean curvature flow. Analogous results are also obtained in the case of a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda &gt; 0$. Lastly, we include some comments concerning the future causal boundary for cosmological spacetimes which pertain to the CMC conjecture of the authors.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Lagrangian Formulation for Quantum and Classical Gravity at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a systematic Lagrangian approach for quantum gravity in the super-Planckian limit where $s\gg M_{pl}^2\gg t$. The action can be used to calculate to arbitrary accuracy in the quantum and classical expansion parameters $\alpha_Q= \frac{t}{M_{pl}^2}$ and $\alpha_C= \frac{st}{M_{pl}^4}$, respectively, for the scattering of massless particles. The perturbative series contains powers of $\log(s/t)$ which can be resummed using a rapidity renormalization group equation (RRGE) that follows from a factorization theorem which allows us to write the amplitude as a convolution of a soft and collinear jet functions. We prove that the soft function is composed of an infinite tower of operators which do not mix under rapidity renormalization. The running of the leading order (in $G$) operator leads to the graviton Regge trajectory while the next to leading operator running corresponds to the gravitational BFKL equation. For the former, we find agreement with one of the two results previously presented in the literature, while for the ladder our result agrees (up to regulator dependent pieces) with those of Lipatov. We find that the convolutive piece of the gravitational BFKL kernel is the square of that of QCD. The power counting simplifies considerably in the classical limit where we can use our formalism to extract logs at any order in the PM expansion. The leading log at any order in the PM expansion can be calculated without going beyond one loop. The log at $(2N+1)$ order in the Post-Minkowskian expansion follows from calculating the one loop anomalous dimension for the $N+1$th order piece of the soft function and perturbatively solving the RRGE $N-1$ times. The factorization theorem implies that the classical logs which arise alternate between being real and imaginary in nature as $N$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the idea that our universe began as a baby universe and show that this is feasible in a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model with the classically conformal principle. For the first time, we define a measure to describe the probability that we reside in a baby universe, and find that it can be close to 1 in a considerable portion of the parameter space. The framework is consistent with current cosmological data, and it predicts the existence of a heavy neutral gauge boson, which could be detected at colliders, thereby offering a direct link between early-universe dynamics and experimentally testable signatures at the TeV scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Spin of Second-born Black Holes in Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Its Connection to the chi_eff-q Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in GWTC-4.0 show a weaker anti-correlation than in GWTC-3.0, motivating investigation of its physical origin. Within the isolated binary evolution framework, we adopt a recently proposed He-star wind prescription to study the spin of the second-born BH and its impact on the q-chi_eff relation. Using \texttt{MESA}, including the updated He-star wind, internal differential rotation, and tidal interactions, we examine how initial conditions and key processes determine the BH spin. We also perform rapid population synthesis with \texttt{COMPAS} to predict the population-level q-chi_eff correlation. The updated wind prescription is significantly weaker than the standard Dutch scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Detailed binary models of He stars with BH companions show that the resulting BH spin is largely insensitive to the He star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal interaction and to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss dominates: more massive He-star progenitors produce lower-spinning BHs. Initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially under strong tidal coupling. We provide a fitting formula for the spin of the second-born BH. Combining this formula with rapid population synthesis under default assumptions, we find that 85.8% of BBHs formed via stable mass transfer undergo mass-ratio reversal, compared to only 2.8% in the common-envelope channel. Notably, no correlation between q and chi_eff is found in either channel. Future work will explore alternative physical prescriptions and compare our predictions with BBH mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>

Abstract: We use the framework of $\textit{fixed-point BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Multisymplectic Field Theory</title>

Abstract: Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformation may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. Such redundant degrees of freedom may physically be identified with empirically-inaccessible measures of global scale. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends the symmetry reduction procedure to theories of classical fields, in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian settings. In order to maintain Lorentz covariance, while simultaneously working with a finite-dimensional phase space, we employ the De-Donder Weyl formalism, for which the natural description is formulated in terms of the fibered manifolds of multisymplectic geometry. We subsequently analyse a number of simple examples, and provide a discussion of the broader implications of our construction.</description>

      <title>SymBoltz.jl: A symbolic-numeric, approximation-free, and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SymBoltz is a new Julia package for solving the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations in cosmology. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes, and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well to extended models, or alternatively written as one compact system of equations. The modeler provides their equations, and SymBoltz solves them while reducing friction in the modeling process. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages (e.g., background and perturbations), generating analytical and sparse Jacobian matrices, and interpolating arbitrary variables from the solution. Implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times without approximations, which greatly simplifies the code. Performance remains comparable to existing approximation-based codes due to efficient high-order implicit methods, fast generated code, optimal handling of the Jacobian, and sparse matrix methods. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in large parameter spaces, Fisher forecasting, emulator training, and sensitivity analyses. The main features form a synergy that reinforces the design of the code. Output spectra agree with established codes up to 0.1% with standard precision levels. More work is needed to implement additional features and for fast reverse-mode automatic differentiation of scalar loss functions. SymBoltz is publicly available with single-command installation and extensive documentation. We welcome all contributions to the code from the community.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Constraints on Neutron-Star Pressure Anisotropy via Universal Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars may exhibit pressure anisotropy arising from various physical mechanisms, such as elasticity, magnetic fields, viscosity, and superfluidity. We compute the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode oscillation frequency of anisotropic neutron stars using a phenomenological quasi-local model characterized by a single dimensionless anisotropy parameter. We find that while the relation between the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode frequency depends on the degree of anisotropy, it remains largely insensitive to variations in the equation of state (the relation between radial pressure and energy density) for a fixed anisotropy parameter, similar to the isotropic case. Leveraging this anisotropy-dependent universal relation within a statistical framework, we place constraints on the anisotropy parameter using both the gravitational wave observation of GW170817 and simulated data for a GW170817-like event observed by a future network of detectors. We find that the anisotropy parameter can be constrained to order unity with current data, and the bounds remain comparable with future detector sensitivities. Importantly, these constraints are only weakly affected by uncertainties in the neutron-star equation of state.</description>

      <title>Statistical isotropy of the universe and the look-elsewhere effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Jones et al. [arXiv:2310.12859] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5\sigma$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $\Lambda$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3\sigma$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2\sigma$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy.</description>
