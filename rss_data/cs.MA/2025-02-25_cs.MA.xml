      <title>Urban Emergency Rescue Based on Multi-Agent Collaborative Learning: Coordination Between Fire Engines and Traffic Lights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, traffic management in urban areas is one of the major economic problems. In particular, when faced with emergency situations like firefighting, timely and efficient traffic dispatching is crucial. Intelligent coordination between multiple departments is essential to realize efficient emergency rescue. In this demo, we present a framework that integrates techniques for collaborative learning methods into the well-known Unity Engine simulator, and thus these techniques can be evaluated in realistic settings. In particular, the framework allows flexible settings such as the number and type of collaborative agents, learning strategies, reward functions, and constraint conditions in practice. The framework is evaluated for an emergency rescue scenario, which could be used as a simulation tool for urban emergency departments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Coalition Structure Detection in Natural Language-based Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strategic multi-agent sequential interactions, detecting dynamic coalition structures is crucial for understanding how self-interested agents coordinate to influence outcomes. However, natural-language-based interactions introduce unique challenges to coalition detection due to ambiguity over intents and difficulty in modeling players' subjective perspectives. We propose a new method that leverages recent advancements in large language models and game theory to predict dynamic multilateral coalition formation in Diplomacy, a strategic multi-agent game where agents negotiate coalitions using natural language. The method consists of two stages. The first stage extracts the set of agreements discussed by two agents in their private dialogue, by combining a parsing-based filtering function with a fine-tuned language model trained to predict player intents. In the second stage, we define a new metric using the concept of subjective rationalizability from hypergame theory to evaluate the expected value of an agreement for each player. We then compute this metric for each agreement identified in the first stage by assessing the strategic value of the agreement for both players and taking into account the subjective belief of one player that the second player would honor the agreement. We demonstrate that our method effectively detects potential coalition structures in online Diplomacy gameplay by assigning high values to agreements likely to be honored and low values to those likely to be violated. The proposed method provides foundational insights into coalition formation in multi-agent environments with language-based negotiation and offers key directions for future research on the analysis of complex natural language-based interactions between agents.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Strength of Disagreement: Unraveling the Consensus-Diversity Tradeoff in Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus formation is pivotal in multi-agent systems (MAS), balancing collective coherence with individual diversity. Conventional LLM-based MAS primarily rely on explicit coordination, e.g., prompts or voting, risking premature homogenization. We argue that implicit consensus, where agents exchange information yet independently form decisions via in-context learning, can be more effective in dynamic environments that require long-horizon adaptability. By retaining partial diversity, systems can better explore novel strategies and cope with external shocks. We formalize a consensus-diversity tradeoff, showing conditions where implicit methods outperform explicit ones. Experiments on three scenarios -- Dynamic Disaster Response, Information Spread and Manipulation, and Dynamic Public-Goods Provision -- confirm partial deviation from group norms boosts exploration, robustness, and performance. We highlight emergent coordination via in-context learning, underscoring the value of preserving diversity for resilient decision-making.</description>

      <title>Exclusion Zones of Instant Runoff Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research on instant runoff voting (IRV) shows that it exhibits a striking combinatorial property in one-dimensional preference spaces: there is an "exclusion zone" around the median voter such that if a candidate from the exclusion zone is on the ballot, then the winner must come from the exclusion zone. Thus, in one dimension, IRV cannot elect an extreme candidate as long as a sufficiently moderate candidate is running. In this work, we examine the mathematical structure of exclusion zones as a broad phenomenon in more general preference spaces. We prove that with voters uniformly distributed over any $d$-dimensional hyperrectangle (for $d &gt; 1$), IRV has no nontrivial exclusion zone. However, we also show that IRV exclusion zones are not solely a one-dimensional phenomenon. For irregular higher-dimensional preference spaces with fewer symmetries than hyperrectangles, IRV can exhibit nontrivial exclusion zones. As a further exploration, we study IRV exclusion zones in graph voting, where nodes represent voters who prefer candidates closer to them in the graph. Here, we show that IRV exclusion zones present a surprising computational challenge: even checking whether a given set of positions is an IRV exclusion zone is NP-hard. We develop an efficient randomized approximation algorithm for checking and finding exclusion zones. We also report on computational experiments with exclusion zones in two directions: (i) applying our approximation algorithm to a collection of real-world school friendship networks, we find that about 60% of these networks have probable nontrivial IRV exclusion zones; and (ii) performing an exhaustive computer search of small graphs and trees, we also find nontrivial IRV exclusion zones in most graphs. While our focus is on IRV, the properties of exclusion zones we establish provide a novel method for analyzing voting systems in metric spaces more generally.</description>

      <title>MobileSteward: Integrating Multiple App-Oriented Agents with Self-Evolution to Automate Cross-App Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile phone agents can assist people in automating daily tasks on their phones, which have emerged as a pivotal research spotlight. However, existing procedure-oriented agents struggle with cross-app instructions, due to the following challenges: (1) complex task relationships, (2) diverse app environment, and (3) error propagation and information loss in multi-step execution. Drawing inspiration from object-oriented programming principles, we recognize that object-oriented solutions is more suitable for cross-app instruction. To address these challenges, we propose a self-evolving multi-agent framework named MobileSteward, which integrates multiple app-oriented StaffAgents coordinated by a centralized StewardAgent. We design three specialized modules in MobileSteward: (1) Dynamic Recruitment generates a scheduling graph guided by information flow to explicitly associate tasks among apps. (2) Assigned Execution assigns the task to app-oriented StaffAgents, each equipped with app-specialized expertise to address the diversity between apps. (3) Adjusted Evaluation conducts evaluation to provide reflection tips or deliver key information, which alleviates error propagation and information loss during multi-step execution. To continuously improve the performance of MobileSteward, we develop a Memory-based Self-evolution mechanism, which summarizes the experience from successful execution, to improve the performance of MobileSteward. We establish the first English Cross-APP Benchmark (CAPBench) in the real-world environment to evaluate the agents' capabilities of solving complex cross-app instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that MobileSteward achieves the best performance compared to both single-agent and multi-agent frameworks, highlighting the superiority of MobileSteward in better handling user instructions with diverse complexity.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Systems with Large Language Models: A Survey of Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are revolutionizing transportation by reducing human intervention, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing safety. Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their exceptional planning and reasoning capabilities, have been integrated into ADSs to assist with driving decision-making. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advancements in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs have focused on improving inter-agent communication and cooperation. This paper provides a frontier survey of LLM-based multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based approaches based on different agent interaction modes. We then discuss agent-human interactions in scenarios where LLM-based agents engage with humans. Finally, we summarize key applications, datasets, and challenges in this field to support future research (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-based_Multi-agent_ADS-3A5C/README.md).</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Effective and Explainable Multi-Agent Credit Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work, spanning from autonomous vehicle coordination to in-space assembly, has shown the importance of learning collaborative behavior for enabling robots to achieve shared goals. A common approach for learning this cooperative behavior is to utilize the centralized-training decentralized-execution paradigm. However, this approach also introduces a new challenge: how do we evaluate the contributions of each agent's actions to the overall success or failure of the team. This credit assignment problem has remained open, and has been extensively studied in the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning literature. In fact, humans manually inspecting agent behavior often generate better credit evaluations than existing methods. We combine this observation with recent works which show Large Language Models demonstrate human-level performance at many pattern recognition tasks. Our key idea is to reformulate credit assignment to the two pattern recognition problems of sequence improvement and attribution, which motivates our novel LLM-MCA method. Our approach utilizes a centralized LLM reward-critic which numerically decomposes the environment reward based on the individualized contribution of each agent in the scenario. We then update the agents' policy networks based on this feedback. We also propose an extension LLM-TACA where our LLM critic performs explicit task assignment by passing an intermediary goal directly to each agent policy in the scenario. Both our methods far outperform the state-of-the-art on a variety of benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging, Robotic Warehouse, and our new Spaceworld benchmark which incorporates collision-related safety constraints. As an artifact of our methods, we generate large trajectory datasets with each timestep annotated with per-agent reward information, as sampled from our LLM critics.</description>

      <title>MA2RL: Masked Autoencoders for Generalizable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop generalizable models in multi-agent reinforcement learning, recent approaches have been devoted to discovering task-independent skills for each agent, which generalize across tasks and facilitate agents' cooperation. However, particularly in partially observed settings, such approaches struggle with sample efficiency and generalization capabilities due to two primary challenges: (a) How to incorporate global states into coordinating the skills of different agents? (b) How to learn generalizable and consistent skill semantics when each agent only receives partial observations? To address these challenges, we propose a framework called \textbf{M}asked \textbf{A}utoencoders for \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning (MA2RL), which encourages agents to infer unobserved entities by reconstructing entity-states from the entity perspective. The entity perspective helps MA2RL generalize to diverse tasks with varying agent numbers and action spaces. Specifically, we treat local entity-observations as masked contexts of the global entity-states, and MA2RL can infer the latent representation of dynamically masked entities, facilitating the assignment of task-independent skills and the learning of skill semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA2RL achieves significant improvements relative to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating extraordinary performance, remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities and advantageous transferability.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Deployment of Emergent Robot Swarm Behaviors via Representation Learning and Real2Sim2Real Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a swarm of limited-capability robots, we seek to automatically discover the set of possible emergent behaviors. Prior approaches to behavior discovery rely on human feedback or hand-crafted behavior metrics to represent and evolve behaviors and only discover behaviors in simulation, without testing or considering the deployment of these new behaviors on real robot swarms. In this work, we present Real2Sim2Real Behavior Discovery via Self-Supervised Representation Learning, which combines representation learning and novelty search to discover possible emergent behaviors automatically in simulation and enable direct controller transfer to real robots. First, we evaluate our method in simulation and show that our proposed self-supervised representation learning approach outperforms previous hand-crafted metrics by more accurately representing the space of possible emergent behaviors. Then, we address the reality gap by incorporating recent work in sim2real transfer for swarms into our lightweight simulator design, enabling direct robot deployment of all behaviors discovered in simulation on an open-source and low-cost robot platform.</description>

      <title>Together We Rise: Optimizing Real-Time Multi-Robot Task Allocation using Coordinated Heterogeneous Plays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient task allocation among multiple robots is crucial for optimizing productivity in modern warehouses, particularly in response to the increasing demands of online order fulfillment. This paper addresses the real-time multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem in dynamic warehouse environments, where tasks emerge with specified start and end locations. The objective is to minimize both the total travel distance of robots and delays in task completion, while also considering practical constraints such as battery management and collision avoidance. We introduce MRTAgent, a dual-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework inspired by self-play, designed to optimize task assignments and robot selection to ensure timely task execution. For safe navigation, a modified linear quadratic controller (LQR) approach is employed. To the best of our knowledge, MRTAgent is the first framework to address all critical aspects of practical MRTA problems while supporting continuous robot movements.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Bandits with Parsimonious Hints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a hinted heterogeneous multi-agent multi-armed bandits problem (HMA2B), where agents can query low-cost observations (hints) in addition to pulling arms. In this framework, each of the $M$ agents has a unique reward distribution over $K$ arms, and in $T$ rounds, they can observe the reward of the arm they pull only if no other agent pulls that arm. The goal is to maximize the total utility by querying the minimal necessary hints without pulling arms, achieving time-independent regret. We study HMA2B in both centralized and decentralized setups. Our main centralized algorithm, GP-HCLA, which is an extension of HCLA, uses a central decision-maker for arm-pulling and hint queries, achieving $O(M^4K)$ regret with $O(MK\log T)$ adaptive hints. In decentralized setups, we propose two algorithms, HD-ETC and EBHD-ETC, that allow agents to choose actions independently through collision-based communication and query hints uniformly until stopping, yielding $O(M^3K^2)$ regret with $O(M^3K\log T)$ hints, where the former requires knowledge of the minimum gap and the latter does not. Finally, we establish lower bounds to prove the optimality of our results and verify them through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sentiment Manipulation by LLM-Enabled Intelligent Trading Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Companies across all economic sectors continue to deploy large language models at a rapid pace. Reinforcement learning is experiencing a resurgence of interest due to its association with the fine-tuning of language models from human feedback. Tool-chain language models control task-specific agents; if the converse has not already appeared, it soon will. In this paper, we present what we believe is the first investigation of an intelligent trading agent based on continuous deep reinforcement learning that also controls a large language model with which it can post to a social media feed observed by other traders. We empirically investigate the performance and impact of such an agent in a simulated financial market, finding that it learns to optimize its total reward, and thereby augment its profit, by manipulating the sentiment of the posts it produces. The paper concludes with discussion, limitations, and suggestions for future work.</description>

      <title>PMAT: Optimizing Action Generation Order in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in coordinating agents due to complex interdependencies within multi-agent systems. Most MARL algorithms use the simultaneous decision-making paradigm but ignore the action-level dependencies among agents, which reduces coordination efficiency. In contrast, the sequential decision-making paradigm provides finer-grained supervision for agent decision order, presenting the potential for handling dependencies via better decision order management. However, determining the optimal decision order remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Action Generation with Plackett-Luce Sampling (AGPS), a novel mechanism for agent decision order optimization. We model the order determination task as a Plackett-Luce sampling process to address issues such as ranking instability and vanishing gradient during the network training process. AGPS realizes credit-based decision order determination by establishing a bridge between the significance of agents' local observations and their decision credits, thus facilitating order optimization and dependency management. Integrating AGPS with the Multi-Agent Transformer, we propose the Prioritized Multi-Agent Transformer (PMAT), a sequential decision-making MARL algorithm with decision order optimization. Experiments on benchmarks including StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo show that PMAT outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, greatly enhancing coordination efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, with deep neural networks substantially augmenting its learning capabilities. However, centralized RL becomes impractical for ATSC involving multiple agents due to the exceedingly high dimensionality of the joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) mitigates this scalability issue by decentralizing control to local RL agents. Nevertheless, this decentralized method introduces new challenges: the environment becomes partially observable from the perspective of each local agent due to constrained inter-agent communication. Both centralized RL and MARL exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses, particularly under heavy intersectional traffic conditions. In this paper, we justify that MARL can achieve the optimal global Q-value by separating into multiple IRL (Independent Reinforcement Learning) processes when no spill-back congestion occurs (no agent dependency) among agents (intersections). In the presence of spill-back congestion (with agent dependency), the maximum global Q-value can be achieved by using centralized RL. Building upon the conclusions, we propose a novel Dynamic Parameter Update Strategy for Deep Q-Network (DQN-DPUS), which updates the weights and bias based on the dependency dynamics among agents, i.e. updating only the diagonal sub-matrices for the scenario without spill-back congestion. We validate the DQN-DPUS in a simple network with two intersections under varying traffic, and show that the proposed strategy can speed up the convergence rate without sacrificing optimal exploration. The results corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the efficacy of DQN-DPUS in optimizing traffic signal control.</description>

      <title>Toward Responsible Federated Large Language Models: Leveraging a Safety Filter and Constitutional AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on training large language models (LLMs) using federated learning, known as FedLLM. However, responsible AI (RAI), which aims to ensure safe responses, remains underexplored in the context of FedLLM. In FedLLM, client data used for training may contain harmful content, leading to unsafe LLMs that generate harmful responses. Aggregating such unsafe LLMs into the global model and distributing them to clients may result in the widespread deployment of unsafe LLMs. To address this issue, we incorporate two well-known RAI methods into FedLLM: the safety filter and constitutional AI. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods significantly enhance the safety of the LLM, achieving over a 20% improvement on AdvBench, a benchmark for evaluating safety performance.</description>

      <title>Order Fairness Evaluation of DAG-based ledgers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Order fairness in distributed ledgers refers to properties that relate the order in which transactions are sent or received to the order in which they are eventually finalized, i.e., totally ordered. The study of such properties is relatively new and has been especially stimulated by the rise of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks in blockchain environments. Indeed, in many classical blockchain protocols, leaders are responsible for selecting the transactions to be included in blocks, which creates a clear vulnerability and opportunity for transaction order manipulation.
  Unlike blockchains, DAG-based ledgers allow participants in the network to independently propose blocks, which are then arranged as vertices of a directed acyclic graph. Interestingly, leaders in DAG-based ledgers are elected only after the fact, once transactions are already part of the graph, to determine their total order. In other words, transactions are not chosen by single leaders; instead, they are collectively validated by the nodes, and leaders are only elected to establish an ordering. This approach intuitively reduces the risk of transaction manipulation and enhances fairness.
  In this paper, we aim to quantify the capability of DAG-based ledgers to achieve order fairness. To this end, we define new variants of order fairness adapted to DAG-based ledgers and evaluate the impact of an adversary capable of compromising a limited number of nodes (below the one-third threshold) to reorder transactions. We analyze how often our order fairness properties are violated under different network conditions and parameterizations of the DAG algorithm, depending on the adversary's power.
  Our study shows that DAG-based ledgers are still vulnerable to reordering attacks, as an adversary can coordinate a minority of Byzantine nodes to manipulate the DAG's structure.</description>

      <title>Survey on Strategic Mining in Blockchain: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17307v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic mining attacks, such as selfish mining, exploit blockchain consensus protocols by deviating from honest behavior to maximize rewards. Markov Decision Process (MDP) analysis faces scalability challenges in modern digital economics, including blockchain. To address these limitations, reinforcement learning (RL) provides a scalable alternative, enabling adaptive strategy optimization in complex dynamic environments.
  In this survey, we examine RL's role in strategic mining analysis, comparing it to MDP-based approaches. We begin by reviewing foundational MDP models and their limitations, before exploring RL frameworks that can learn near-optimal strategies across various protocols. Building on this analysis, we compare RL techniques and their effectiveness in deriving security thresholds, such as the minimum attacker power required for profitable attacks. Expanding the discussion further, we classify consensus protocols and propose open challenges, such as multi-agent dynamics and real-world validation.
  This survey highlights the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of selfish mining, including protocol design, threat detection, and security analysis, while offering a strategic roadmap for researchers in decentralized systems and AI-driven analytics.</description>

      <title>A Novel Convex Layers Strategy for Circular Formation in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article considers the problem of conflict-free distribution of point-sized agents on a circular periphery encompassing all agents. The two key elements of the proposed policy include the construction of a set of convex layers (nested convex polygons) using the initial positions of the agents, and a novel search space region for each of the agents. The search space for an agent on a convex layer is defined as the region enclosed between the lines passing through the agent's position and normal to its supporting edges. Guaranteeing collision-free paths, a goal assignment policy designates a unique goal position within the search space of an agent at the initial time itself, requiring no further computation thereafter. In contrast to the existing literature, this work presents a one-shot, collision-free solution to the circular distribution problem by utilizing only the initial positions of the agents. Illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy.</description>

      <title>Self-Confirming Transformer for Belief-Conditioned Adaptation in Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the distribution shift between the offline dataset and the online environment. In multi-agent RL (MARL), this distribution shift may arise from the nonstationary opponents in the online testing who display distinct behaviors from those recorded in the offline dataset. Hence, the key to the broader deployment of offline MARL is the online adaptation to nonstationary opponents. Recent advances in foundation models, e.g., large language models, have demonstrated the generalization ability of the transformer, an emerging neural network architecture, in sequence modeling, of which offline RL is a special case. One naturally wonders \textit{whether offline-trained transformer-based RL policies adapt to nonstationary opponents online}. We propose a novel auto-regressive training to equip transformer agents with online adaptability based on the idea of self-augmented pre-conditioning. The transformer agent first learns offline to predict the opponent's action based on past observations. When deployed online, such a fictitious opponent play, referred to as the belief, is fed back to the transformer, together with other environmental feedback, to generate future actions conditional on the belief. Motivated by self-confirming equilibrium in game theory, the training loss consists of belief consistency loss, requiring the beliefs to match the opponent's actual actions and best response loss, mandating the agent to behave optimally under the belief. We evaluate the online adaptability of the proposed self-confirming transformer (SCT) in a structured environment, iterated prisoner's dilemma games, to demonstrate SCT's belief consistency and equilibrium behaviors as well as more involved multi-particle environments to showcase its superior performance against nonstationary opponents over prior transformers and offline MARL baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning to Manipulate under Limited Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By classic results in social choice theory, any reasonable preferential voting method sometimes gives individuals an incentive to report an insincere preference. The extent to which different voting methods are more or less resistant to such strategic manipulation has become a key consideration for comparing voting methods. Here we measure resistance to manipulation by whether neural networks of various sizes can learn to profitably manipulate a given voting method in expectation, given different types of limited information about how other voters will vote. We trained over 100,000 neural networks of 26 sizes to manipulate against 8 different voting methods, under 6 types of limited information, in committee-sized elections with 5-21 voters and 3-6 candidates. We find that some voting methods, such as Borda, are highly manipulable by networks with limited information, while others, such as Instant Runoff, are not, despite being quite profitably manipulated by an ideal manipulator with full information. For the three probability models for elections that we use, the overall least manipulable of the 8 methods we study are Condorcet methods, namely Minimax and Split Cycle.</description>

      <title>KnowAgent: Knowledge-Augmented Planning for LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</description>

      <title>DebUnc: Improving Large Language Model Agent Communication With Uncertainty Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent debates have been introduced to improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by having multiple agents discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate. However, models often generate incorrect yet confident-sounding responses, which can mislead others. This issue arises partly because agents do not consider how confident their peers are. To address this, we propose DebUnc, a debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence. Confidence is then conveyed through a modified attention mechanism that adjusts token weights, or through textual prompts. Evaluations across benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective and that performance continues to improve as uncertainty estimation becomes more reliable. The code is available at https://github.com/lukeyoffe/debunc.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Construction of Finite Abstractions for Interconnected Systems: A Compositional Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-state abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) present a promising avenue for the formal verification and synthesis of controllers in continuous-space control systems. These abstractions provide simplified models that capture the fundamental behaviors of the original systems. However, the creation of such abstractions typically relies on the availability of precise knowledge concerning system dynamics, which might not be available in many real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven and compositional approach for constructing finite abstractions for interconnected systems comprised of discrete-time control subsystems with partially unknown dynamics. These subsystems interact through a partially unknown static interconnection map. Our methodology for abstracting the interconnected system involves constructing abstractions for individual subsystems and incorporating an abstraction of the interconnection map.</description>

      <title>Coevolving with the Other You: Fine-Tuning LLM with Sequential Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorfBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorfEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/WorfBench.</description>

      <title>GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18032v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy. The code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/GraphTeam.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gas source localization is pivotal for the rapid mitigation of gas leakage disasters, where mobile robots emerge as a promising solution. However, existing methods predominantly schedule robots' movements based on reactive stimuli or simplified gas plume models. These approaches typically excel in idealized, simulated environments but fall short in real-world gas environments characterized by their patchy distribution. In this work, we introduce SniffySquad, a multi-robot olfaction-based system designed to address the inherent patchiness in gas source localization. SniffySquad incorporates a patchiness-aware active sensing approach that enhances the quality of data collection and estimation. Moreover, it features an innovative collaborative role adaptation strategy to boost the efficiency of source-seeking endeavors. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves an increase in the success rate by $20\%+$ and an improvement in path efficiency by $30\%+$, outperforming state-of-the-art gas source localization solutions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a decentralized, learning-based framework for dynamic coalition formation in Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA). Our approach extends Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) by integrating spatial action maps, robot motion planning, intention sharing, and task allocation revision to enable effective and adaptive coalition formation. Extensive simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of our model, enabling each robot to rely solely on local information to learn timely revisions of task selections and form coalitions with other robots to complete collaborative tasks. Additionally, our model significantly outperforms existing methods, including a market-based baseline. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability and generalizability of the proposed framework, highlighting its ability to handle large robot populations and adapt to scenarios featuring diverse task sets.</description>

      <title>Flow: Modularized Agentic Workflow Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great success in automated planning and task execution. However, the effective adjustment of agentic workflows during execution has not been well studied. An effective workflow adjustment is crucial in real-world scenarios, as the initial plan must adjust to unforeseen challenges and changing conditions in real time to ensure the efficient execution of complex tasks. In this paper, we define workflows as an activity-on-vertex (AOV) graph, which allows continuous workflow refinement by LLM agents through dynamic subtask allocation adjustment based on historical performance and previous AOVs. To further enhance framework performance, we emphasize modularity in workflow design based on evaluating parallelism and dependency complexity. With this design, our proposed multi-agent framework achieves efficient concurrent execution of subtasks, effective goal achievement, and enhanced error tolerance. Empirical results across various practical tasks demonstrate significant improvements in the efficiency of multi-agent frameworks through dynamic workflow refinement and modularization.

      <title>Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</description>

      <title>Implicit Repair with Reinforcement Learning in Emergent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational repair is a mechanism used to detect and resolve miscommunication and misinformation problems when two or more agents interact. One particular and underexplored form of repair in emergent communication is the implicit repair mechanism, where the interlocutor purposely conveys the desired information in such a way as to prevent misinformation from any other interlocutor. This work explores how redundancy can modify the emergent communication protocol to continue conveying the necessary information to complete the underlying task, even with additional external environmental pressures such as noise. We focus on extending the signaling game, called the Lewis Game, by adding noise in the communication channel and inputs received by the agents. Our analysis shows that agents add redundancy to the transmitted messages as an outcome to prevent the negative impact of noise on the task success. Additionally, we observe that the emerging communication protocol's generalization capabilities remain equivalent to architectures employed in simpler games that are entirely deterministic. Additionally, our method is the only one suitable for producing robust communication protocols that can handle cases with and without noise while maintaining increased generalization performance levels.</description>
