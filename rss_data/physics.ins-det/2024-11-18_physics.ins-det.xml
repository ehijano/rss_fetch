      <title>Demonstration of the minimal coupling of horizontal accelerations to rotations in a torsion balance suspended from three wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cavendish torsion balance is the instrument of choice for measuring weak forces, such as gravity. Although torsion balances have extremely high sensitivity for measuring forces over ranges of a few cm and more, their dynamics make it difficult to extend this range to much less than fractions of mm. In particular forces such as the Casimir force are usually studied using atomic force microscopes. We present results of our studies of a simple torsion balance with a 3-wire suspension. This device should be able to maintain parallelism between flat plates of areas of a few $\sim\mathrm{cm^2}$ at separations of much less of 10's of $\mathrm{\mu m}$. In this paper we describe our experimental investigation into the coupling of ground tilt to the torsional rotation of the novel device. We show that, like the Cavendish torsion balance, the 3-wire torsion balance is highly insensitive to tilts. We also demonstrate that this tilt sensitivity is itself insensitive to shifts in the centre of mass position of the suspended mass. We discuss simple models of the 3-wire torsion balance that show that it is only the static wire lengths that determine the coupling of tilts and horizontal accelerations. We also discuss designs of torsion balances where sensitivity and noise rejection to tilts are optimised.</description>

      <title>Design of Dedicated Tilt-to-Length Calibration Maneuvers for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilts of certain elements within a laser interferometer can undesirably couple into measurements as a form of noise, known as tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. This TTL coupling is anticipated to be one of the primary noise sources in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, after Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is applied. Despite the careful interferometer design and calibration on the ground, TTL is likely to require in-flight mitigation through post-processing subtraction to achieve the necessary sensitivity. Past research has demonstrated TTL subtraction in simulations through the estimation of 24 linear coupling coefficients using a noise minimization approach. This paper investigates an approach based on performing rotation maneuvers for estimating coupling coefficients with low uncertainties. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and optimal configurations of such maneuvers to identify the most efficient solutions. We assess the efficacy of TTL calibration maneuvers by modulating either the spacecraft attitude or the Moving Optical Sub-Assembly (MOSA) yaw angle. We found that sinusoidal signals with amplitudes of around 30 nrad and frequencies near 43 mHz are practical and nearly optimal choices for such modulations. Employing different frequencies generates uncorrelated signals, allowing for multiple maneuvers to be executed simultaneously. Our simulations enable us to estimate the TTL coefficients with precision below 15 um/rad (1-sigma, in free space) after a total maneuver time of 20 minutes. The results are compared to the estimation uncertainties that can be achieved without using maneuvers.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of a Combined Light and Charge Pixel Readout on the Anode Plane of a LArTPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The novel SoLAr concept aims to extend sensitivities of liquid-argon neutrino detectors down to the MeV scale for next-generation detectors. SoLAr plans to accomplish this with a liquid-argon time projection chamber that employs an anode plane with dual charge and light readout, which enables precision matching of light and charge signals for data acquisition and reconstruction purposes. We present the results of a first demonstration of the SoLAr detector concept with a small-scale prototype detector integrating a pixel-based charge readout and silicon photomultipliers on a shared printed circuit board. We discuss the design of the prototype, and its operation and performance, highlighting the capability of such a detector design.</description>

      <title>Performance study of a bakelite RPC prototype built by new technique of linseed oil coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) is one of the most commonly used detectors in high energy physics experiments for triggering and tracking because of its good efficiency ($\textgreater$~90\%) and time resolution ($\sim$~1-2~ns). Generally, bakelite which is one of the most commonly used materials as electrode plates in RPC, sometimes suffer from surface roughness issues. If the surface is not smooth, the probability of micro discharge and spurious pulses increase, which leads to the deterioration in the performance of the detector. We have developed a new method of linseed oil coating for the bakelite based detectors to avoid the surface roughness issue. The detector is characterised with Tetrafluoroethane (R134a) based gas mixture. The detector is also tested with a high rate of gamma radiation environment in the laboratory for the radiation hardness test. The detailed measurement procedure and test results are presented in this article.</description>

      <title>New methods of neutrino and anti-neutrino detection from 0.115 to 105 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a neutrino detector with threshold energies from ~0.115 to 105 MeV in a clean detection mode almost completely void of accidental backgrounds. It was initially developed for the NASA $\nu$SOL project to put a solar neutrino detector very close to the Sun with 1,000 to 10,000 times higher solar neutrino flux than on Earth. Similar interactions have been found for anti-neutrinos, which were initially intended for Beta decay neutrinos from reactors, geological sources, or for nuclear security applications. These techniques work at the 1 to 100 MeV region for neutrinos from the ORNL Spallation Neutron Source or low energy accelerator neutrino and anti-neutrino production targets less than $\sim$100 MeV. The identification process is clean, with a double pulse detection signature within a time window between the first interaction producing the conversion electron or positron and the secondary gamma emission 100 ns to ~1 $\mu$s, which removes most accidental backgrounds. These new modes for neutrino and anti-neutrino detection of low energy neutrinos and anti-neutrinos could allow improvements to neutrino interaction measurements from an accelerator beam on a target.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by $\Delta$E-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through better particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.</description>
