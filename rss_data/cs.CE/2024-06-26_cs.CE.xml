      <title>Boosting Bitcoin Minute Trend Prediction Using the Separation Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the trend of Bitcoin, a highly volatile cryptocurrency, remains a challenging task. Accurate forecasting holds immense potential for investors and market participants dealing with High Frequency Trading systems. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the significance of using a systematic approach toward selecting informative observations for enhancing Bitcoin minute trend prediction. While a multitude of data collection methods exist, a crucial barrier remains: efficiently selecting the most informative data for building powerful prediction models. This study tackles this challenge head-on by introducing the Separation Index, a groundbreaking tool for fast and effective data (feature) subset selection. The Separation Index operates by measuring the improvement in class separability (i.e. upward vs. downward trends) with each added feature set. This innovative metric guides the creation of a highly informative dataset, maximizing the model's ability to differentiate between price movements. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, achieving unprecedented accuracy in minute-scale Bitcoin trend prediction, surpassing the performance of previous studies. This significant advancement paves the way for a new era of data-driven decision-making in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency markets.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Phase Field Simulations Through a Hybrid Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator with U-Net Backbone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prolonged contact between a corrosive liquid and metal alloys can cause progressive dealloying. For such liquid-metal dealloying (LMD) process, phase field models have been developed. However, the governing equations often involve coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE), which are challenging to solve numerically. In particular, stiffness in the PDEs requires an extremely small time steps (e.g. $10^{-12}$ or smaller). This computational bottleneck is especially problematic when running LMD simulation until a late time horizon is required. This motivates the development of surrogate models capable of leaping forward in time, by skipping several consecutive time steps at-once. In this paper, we propose U-Shaped Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (U-AFNO), a machine learning (ML) model inspired by recent advances in neural operator learning. U-AFNO employs U-Nets for extracting and reconstructing local features within the physical fields, and passes the latent space through a vision transformer (ViT) implemented in the Fourier space (AFNO). We use U-AFNOs to learn the dynamics mapping the field at a current time step into a later time step. We also identify global quantities of interest (QoI) describing the corrosion process (e.g. the deformation of the liquid-metal interface) and show that our proposed U-AFNO model is able to accurately predict the field dynamics, in-spite of the chaotic nature of LMD. Our model reproduces the key micro-structure statistics and QoIs with a level of accuracy on-par with the high-fidelity numerical solver. We also investigate the opportunity of using hybrid simulations, in which we alternate forward leap in time using the U-AFNO with high-fidelity time stepping. We demonstrate that while advantageous for some surrogate model design choices, our proposed U-AFNO model in fully auto-regressive settings consistently outperforms hybrid schemes.</description>

      <title>Error estimation and step size control with minimal subsystem interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review error estimation methods for co-simulation, in particular methods that are applicable when the subsystems provide minimal interfaces. By this, we mean that subsystems do not support rollback of time steps, do not output derivatives, and do not provide any other information about their internals other than the output variables that are required for coupling with other subsystems. Such "black-box" subsystems are quite common in industrial applications, and the ability to couple them and run large-system simulations is one of the major attractions of the co-simulation paradigm. We also describe how the resulting error indicators may be used to automatically control macro time step sizes in order to strike a good balance between simulation speed and accuracy. The various elements of the step size control algorithm are presented in pseudocode so that readers may implement them and test them in their own applications. We provide practicable advice on how to use error indicators to judge the quality of a co-simulation, how to avoid common pitfalls, and how to configure the step size control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Exploring Biomarker Relationships in Both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Through a Bayesian Network Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the complex relationships of biomarkers in diabetes is pivotal for advancing treatment strategies, a pressing need in diabetes research. This study applies Bayesian network structure learning to analyze the Shanghai Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus datasets, revealing complex relationships among key diabetes-related biomarkers. The constructed Bayesian network presented notable predictive accuracy, particularly for Type 2 diabetes mellitus, with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 18.23 mg/dL, as validated through leave-one-domain experiments and Clarke error grid analysis. This study not only elucidates the intricate dynamics of diabetes through a deeper understanding of biomarker interplay but also underscores the significant potential of integrating data-driven and knowledge-driven methodologies in the realm of personalized diabetes management. Such an approach paves the way for more custom and effective treatment strategies, marking a notable advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>Using iterated local alignment to aggregate GPS trajectories into a traffic flow map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Desire line maps are widely deployed for traffic flow analysis by virtue of their ease of interpretation and computation. They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. GPS trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the GPS trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching APIs produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the GPS trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical GPS trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</description>

      <title>Making Tax Smart: Feasibility of Distributed Ledger Technology for building tax compliance functionality to Central Bank Digital Currency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest advancements in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), and payment architectures such as the UK's New Payments Architecture, present opportunities for leveraging the hidden informational value and intelligence within payments. In this paper, we present Smart Money, an infrastructure capability for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) which enables real-time Value Added Tax split payments, oversight, controlled access and smart policy implementation. This capability is implemented as a prototype, called Making Tax Smart (MTS), which is based on the open source R3 Corda framework. The results presented herein confirm that it is feasible to build a MTS capability which is scalable and co-exists with the current payment systems. Smart Money CBDC has the potential to mobilise payments data in order to transform the role of money from a blunt instrument to a government policy sensor and actuator without disrupting the existing money system. DLT, smart contracts and programmable money have a crucial role to play with benefits for government departments, the economy and society as a whole.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. Our method preserves properties of density matrices such as Hermitian symmetry and constant trace. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This derivation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>Multi-task learning for molecular electronic structure approaching coupled-cluster accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules. However, most existing ML models for molecular electronic properties use density functional theory (DFT) databases as ground truth in training, and their prediction accuracy cannot surpass that of DFT. In this work, we developed a unified ML method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms DFT with the widely-used hybrid and double hybrid functionals in computational costs and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. As case studies, we apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers on both ground state and excited state properties, demonstrating its accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that are hard to calculate using CCSD(T)-level methods.</description>
