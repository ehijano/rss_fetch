      <title>Closer look at enhanced three-nucleon forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent publication, Cirigliano {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 022501 (2025)] argue that three-nucleon forces (3NFs) involving short-range operators that couple two pions with two nucleons are enhanced beyond what is expected in chiral effective field theory based on naive dimensional analysis. Here, we scrutinize the arguments and conclusions of that paper by taking into account renormalization scheme dependence of the corresponding low-energy constants. We gain further insights into the expected impact of these 3NFs by comparing them with contributions of similar type, induced by pion-exchange diagrams at lower orders in the chiral expansion. We also estimate the impact of these 3NFs on properties of nuclear matter. After removal of scheme-dependent short-distance components in pion loops, the 3NFs considered by Cirigliano {\it et al.} are shown to yield reasonably small contributions to the equation of state of neutron and symmetric nuclear matter in agreement with expectations based on Weinberg's power counting.</description>

      <title>Impact of experimental mass of $^{70}$Kr on the $^{68}$Se waiting-point in $rp$-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent mass measurement of $^{70}$Kr using the $B\rho$-defined isochronous mass spectrometry yields a mass excess of $-41320(140)$ keV, indicating a 220-keV increase in binding energy compared to the AME2020 prediction. We utilize this experimental mass -- the last piece of information needed -- to model the potential waiting point $^{68}$Se in $rp$-process and quantitatively constrain the sequential $p$-capture reaction flow bypassing this waiting point. Our investigation shows that the more tightly bound nature of $^{70}$Kr enhances this reaction flow up to a factor of four. This enhancement reduces the effective half-life of $^{68}$Se. {A} one-zone X-ray burst model calculations reveal that the higher flow of $^{70}$Kr has distinct effects on the tail structure of light curve and the final SnSbTe abundances in the ashes due to a stronger $rp$-process heating.</description>

      <title>Analysis of correlations between dipole transitions $1^-_1\rightarrow 0^+_1$ and $3^-_1\rightarrow 2^+_1$ based on the collective model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the work is to evaluate effect of the isovector dipole and quadrupole-octupole modes coupling on the $B(E1;1^-_1\rightarrow 0^+_1)/B(E1;3^-_1\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ ratio. The Hamiltonian of the phenomenological collective model is used to calculate mixing of the isovector dipole and quadrupole and octupole modes. The effect of the admixture of the giant dipole resonance to the low-lying collective quadrupole and octupole modes is estimated. It is shown that the coupling of the quadrupole and octupole collective modes to giant dipole resonance leads to decrease of the ratio $B(E1;1^-_1\rightarrow 0^+_1)/B(E1;3^-_1\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ relative to the value 7/3 predicted by the pure collective quadrupole-octupole model.</description>

      <title>Modeling Short-Range Nucleon Pair and Triplet Abundances in Atomic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-range correlated (SRC) nucleon pairs provide a sensitive probe of the short-distance structure of atomic nuclei and the underlying nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction. We present a simple numerical method to estimate the number of two- and three-nucleon SRC clusters using an independent-particle shell model with a harmonic-oscillator basis. The relative abundances of proton-neutron (pn), proton-proton (pp), and neutron-neutron (nn) SRC pairs are calculated for Al, Fe, and Pb nuclei, normalized to carbon, and compared with existing analytical predictions and available extractions from experimental data. We extend the analysis to the isotopes 40Ca, 48Ca, and 54Fe (collectively, the CaFe nuclei), which have been recently measured but whose SRC results are not yet published. These isotopes provide insight into the role of 1f7/2 shell occupancy in SRC pair formation. Finally, we present a reference baseline for three-nucleon SRC cluster abundances across the studied nuclei, assuming 3N clusters originate from independent two-nucleon interactions. The predicted baseline is about 2.5% 3N-SRC/2N-SRC ratio for all medium and heavy nuclei. Deviations from this baseline may indicate the presence of additional short-range nuclear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Prediction of deformed halo nuclei $^{43,45}$Si from multiple criteria based on structure and reaction analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Possible deformed neutron halos in silicon isotopes are investigated from both structure and reaction perspectives using the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) combined with the Glauber model. The experimental neutron separation energies of silicon isotopes are well reproduced by the DRHBc theory. Multiple halo criteria are examined, including the global ones based on root-mean-square radii and density profiles, as well as the microscopic ones based on single-particle orbitals and their spatial distributions. Calculations employing different density functionals and pairing strengths consistently indicate the emergence of $p$-wave neutron halos in $^{43,45}$Si, accompanied by pronounced shape decoupling between the halo and the core. Moreover, the enhanced reaction cross sections and the narrow longitudinal momentum distributions of one-neutron removal residues provide additional evidence supporting the halo structures in $^{43,45}$Si.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.1763(5)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>Resonances: Universality and Factorization on Higher Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most particles in nature are unstable, manifesting as resonances in scattering processes. Using analyticity and unitarity, we show nonperturbatively that resonances, defined as poles on higher Riemann sheets of scattering amplitudes, share basic properties with stable particles: (i) Universality, that a resonance generically appears in every S-matrix element; and (ii) Factorization, that amplitudes factorize on resonance poles. Our framework applies in any spacetime dimension and across arbitrarily many two-particle cuts, including cases where the kinematic Riemann surface becomes infinitely sheeted. Importantly, we find that resonance data (mass, width, couplings, and sheet index) are fully encoded on the physical sheet, where causality can impose additional constraints. These results are relevant for extending S-matrix bootstrap studies beyond elastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Improved Standard-Model predictions for $\eta^{(\prime)}\to \ell^+ \ell^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare decays $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\ell^+\ell^-$, $\ell\in\{e,\mu\}$, are highly suppressed in the Standard Model, both by their chirality structure and the required loop attaching the lepton line to the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma^*\gamma^*$ matrix element. The latter is described by a single scalar function, the transition form factor, which has recently been studied in great detail for $\eta^{(\prime)}$ in the context of the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Based on these results, we evaluate the corresponding prediction for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ dilepton decays, supplemented by an improved evaluation of the asymptotic contributions including pseudoscalar mass effects. In particular, the dispersive representation for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ transition form factors allows us, for the first time, to perform a robust evaluation of the imaginary parts due to subleading channels besides the dominant two-photon cut. Our final results are $\text{Br}[\eta\to e^+e^-]=5.37(4)(2)[4]\times 10^{-9}$, $\text{Br}[\eta\to \mu^+\mu^-]=4.54(4)(2)[4]\times 10^{-6}$, $\text{Br}[\eta'\to e^+e^-]=1.80(2)(3)[3]\times 10^{-10}$, and $\text{Br}[\eta'\to \mu^+\mu^-]=1.22(2)(2)[3]\times 10^{-7}$, where the errors refer to the uncertainty in the normalized branching fraction, the one propagated from $\text{Br}[\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma]$, and the total uncertainty, respectively. The branching fraction for $\eta\to\mu^+\mu^-$ exhibits a mild $1.6\sigma$ tension with experiment, and we explore the bounds that can be derived on physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Magnetoviscosity of relativistic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles quantum field-theoretical methods, we investigate the shear and bulk viscosities of strongly magnetized relativistic plasmas. The analysis is performed within the weak-coupling approximation and utilizes known results for the fermion damping rates in the Landau-level representation, $\Gamma_{n}(p_{z})$, which are dominated by one-to-two and two-to-one processes in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The transverse and longitudinal components of the viscosities are derived using Kubo's linear response theory. Our results reveal a pronounced anisotropy in both shear and bulk viscosities induced by the magnetic field. In the case of an electron-positron plasma, where the weak-coupling approximation is well justified, the dimensionless longitudinal shear viscosity $\eta_{\parallel}/T^3$ increases rapidly with the magnetic field strength, while the transverse component $\eta_{\perp}/T^3$ decreases and can even drop below the KSS bound at sufficiently large fields. In contrast, both the dimensionless longitudinal and transverse bulk viscosities, $\zeta_{\perp}/T^3$ and $\zeta_{\parallel}/T^3$, initially rise from small values, reach a maximum, and then gradually decrease toward zero. We find that the bulk viscosity is highly sensitive to the longitudinal and transverse components of the sound velocity, particularly at high magnetic fields, indicating that its quantitative values should be interpreted with caution. We also calculate an additional cross viscosity, which is negative and whose magnitude increases with the magnetic field strength. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of these magnetoviscosity results in the contexts of magnetar physics and the strongly magnetized quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use total energy-momentum conservation and the Bianchi identity (magnetic-flux conservation) to construct second-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in a Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator (NESO) framework. We obtain all dissipative tensors in the medium by focusing on a relativistic magnetized plasma that preserves parity and is symmetric to charge-conjugation. We also provide Kubo formulas for all transport coefficients that arise at second order. Moreover, we extend the NESO formalism to systematically take into account for nonlocal contributions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-preserving calculation of pion light-front wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poincar\'e-covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions are used to calculate light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion, $\pi$, and an analogue state, $\pi_{s\bar s}$. The current masses of the degenerate valence constituents in the $\pi_{s\bar s}$ are around $25$-times larger than those of the pion's valence constituents. Both valence spin-antialigned ($\mathcal L=0$) and valence spin-aligned ($\mathcal L=1$) components are obtained and combined to produce the complete LFWF for each system. Comparing predictions delivered by two distinct Bethe-Salpeter kernels, the impact of nonperturbative dynamical effects contained in the more sophisticated (bRL) kernel are seen to be significant; and contrasts between $\pi$, $\pi_{s \bar s}$ results reveal the interplay between emergent hadron mass and mass effects owing to Higgs-boson couplings. Amongst the results, one finds that for $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$, the LFWFs can be approximated by a separable form, with that representation being pointwise reliable in the bRL cases. Moreover, the $\mathcal L=1$ component is important; so a LFWF obtained after omission of this piece is typically a poor representation of the system. These features are naturally expressed in $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$ transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). In this connection, it is found that a Gaussian \textit{Ansatz} can only provide a rough guide to TMD pointwise behaviour: magnitude deviations between \textit{Ansatz} and prediction exceed a factor of two on $k_\perp^2 \gtrsim 0.55\,$GeV$^2$. One should therefore be cautious in interpreting conclusions drawn from phenomenological analyses based upon Gaussian \textit{Ans\"atze}.</description>

      <title>Substructure grooming of inclusive and photon-tagged jets in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet substructure provides a powerful probe of partonic interactions within the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions. In this paper, we present a systematic theoretical study of the groomed substructures for both inclusive jets and photon-tagged jets ($\gamma+$jets) utilizing the Dynamical and Soft-Drop Grooming algorithms in PbPb collisions by employing the SHELL transport model. Our theoretical calculations exhibit a suppression at high $k_{\rm T,g}$, the relative transverse momentum between the two subjets in the groomed substructure, consistent with the recent ALICE measurements. We show that the suppression of high $k_{\rm T,g}$ arises from the combined effects of the reduction of the subleading subjet transverse momentum due to partonic energy loss and the narrowing of the groomed jet radius $R_g$ induced by selection bias. Our findings demonstrate that no enhancement is observed at high $k_{\rm T,g}$, even in the complete absence of selection bias. Furthermore, we propose that the broadening of $R_g$ in photon-tagged jets, which are less susceptible to selection bias compared to inclusive jets, provides relatively direct evidence of the jet substructure broadening. Our analysis reveals that the $R_g$ broadening becomes more pronounced as the jet radius increases, where the medium-induced gluon radiation plays a dominant role in driving such broadening. In particular, we find that as the jet radius increases, the Soft Drop grooming algorithm exhibits a better resolving power for the contribution of the medium response to the jet substructure broadening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dilepton production is one of the key probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) that encodes the imaginary part of the electromagnetic current-current correlator. We investigate the effect of local acceleration on the dilepton production by treating acceleration as a small perturbation. Using the thermal Dirac propagator in an accelerated frame within the imaginary-time formalism, we compute the photon polarization tensor and extract its imaginary part. Comparison with the zero-acceleration case isolates the distinct contributions of acceleration to dilepton yields.</description>

Abstract: The photon is arguably the most universally important particle across all fields of physics. Despite its status as a fundamental particle, at high energies the photon can be seen as a hadronic source of partons. The partonic content of the photon is very poorly constrained compared to that of the proton, with photon PDF uncertainties typically one or two orders of magnitude larger than their proton counterparts, despite the fact that its source, the $\gamma\to q\bar{q}$ splitting, is perturbatively calculable. The high luminosity, excellent particle identification, and far-backward electron tagging capabilities of the Electron-Ion Collider make it an ideal environment for studying photon parton distribution functions. Similar to the $p+p$ or $\pi+p$ systems, photoproduction at the EIC can be thought of as two parton distributions colliding. One of the most powerful processes in such collisions is production of lepton pairs, i.e. $h+p\rightarrow l^+l^-+X$, known as the Drell--Yan process. This process has the ability to access for the first time the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions of the photon. The transversely polarized proton beam of the EIC additionally provides a possible means of accessing the transversity distribution of the proton without relying on fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Jet momentum reconstruction in the QGP background with machine learning</title>

Abstract: We apply a Dense Neural Network (DNN) approach to reconstruct jet momentum within a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) background, using simulated data from PYTHIA and Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Models for comparative analysis. We find that medium response particles from the LBT simulation, scattered out of the QGP background but belonging to medium-modified jets, lead to oversubtraction of the background if the DNN model is trained on vacuum jets from PYTHIA simulation. By training the DNN model on quenched jets generated using LBT or the combination of jet samples from PYTHIA and LBT, we significantly reduce this prediction bias and achieve more accurate background subtraction compared to conventional Area-based and Constituent Subtraction methods widely adopted in experimental measurements. We further study the performance of these machine learning models on evaluating the nuclear modification factor of jets, and find that while the unfolding procedure is necessary for correcting residuals in reconstructed jet momenta, models trained on samples incorporating quenched jets still achieve superior accuracy than those trained on vacuum jets even after unfolding.</description>

      <title>Emergent Viscous Hydrodynamics From a Single Quantum Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in open quantum systems where a system with few degrees of freedom is coupled to a large thermal environment.</description>

      <title>Microscopic calculation of two-particle-two-hole meson-exchange currents in $^{40}$Ar and asymmetric scaling properties for neutrino and electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic calculation of two particle-two hole meson exchange current response functions in asymmetric nuclei, with particular emphasis on the $^{40}$Ar nucleus. Employing a relativistic mean-field and relativistic Fermi gas framework, we compute the nuclear response for $^{40}$Ar and compare it with that of the symmetric $^{40}$Ca nucleus, analyzing the role of proton-neutron imbalance. The model incorporates distinct proton and neutron Fermi momenta to accurately capture the nuclear dynamics of systems with $Z \neq N$. Our results indicate that using $^{40}$Ca as a proxy for $^{40}$Ar leads to a systematic error of approximately 10\%. Additionally, we propose an asymmetric scaling formula to obtain the 2p2h response for arbitrary nuclei from the $^{12}$C response, improving the description of asymmetric nuclei. Finally, we benchmark our predictions against inclusive electron scattering and neutrino cross sections.</description>

      <title>Production of Light Nuclei in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7-27$ GeV from STAR BES-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The studies of the production of light nuclei, such as deuteron and helium nuclei, in heavy-ion collisions are essential for understanding the dynamics of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. The yields and ratios of light nuclei serve as an effective method to distinguish between the thermal and coalescence models of light nuclei formation. Within the coalescence framework, the energy dependence of the coalescence parameters reflects the effective volume of the collision system, while in the thermal model yields are governed by chemical freeze-out conditions. The significantly larger datasets from the STAR Beam Energy Scan Phase II (BES-II), combined with enhanced detector capabilities, allow more precise and comprehensive measurements than phase I.
  In these proceedings, we present measurements of light nuclei production, including p, $\rm \bar{p}$, d, $\rm \bar{d}$, $\rm ^3He$, in Au+Au collisions at BES-II energies of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7 - 27$ GeV. The results include centrality-dependent transverse momentum spectra and yields ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}y$), along with coalescence parameters $B_\mathrm{A}$ and particle yield ratios. The physics implications of these results are discussed.</description>
