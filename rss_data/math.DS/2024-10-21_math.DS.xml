      <title>Weak Mixing Transformation Which Is Shannon Orbit Equivalent to a Given Ergodic Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every ergodic transformation is Shannon orbit equivalent to a weak mixing transformation. The proof is based on the techniques introduced by Fieldsteel and Friedman to show that there is a mixing transformation for a given ergodic transformation $T$ which is, for all $a\geq1$, weak-$a$-equivalent to $T$ and, for all $b\in(0,1)$, strong-$b$-equivalent to $T$. In particular, we will adapt the construction of Fieldsteel and Friedman by which they permute the columns of each Rokhlin tower in a sequence of rapidly growing Rokhlin towers so that the corresponding cocycles converge to an orbit equivalence cocycle of $T$ such that the resulting transformation and orbit equivalence have the desired properties. In addition to this, we will demonstrate a flexible method for obtaining actions of $\mathbb{Z}^{2} $ which are Shannon orbit equivalent to a given ergodic transformation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of solutions to some classes of multi-order fractional cooperative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the asymptotic behavior of solutions to multi-order fractional cooperative systems. First, we demonstrate the boundedness of solutions to fractional-order systems under certain conditions imposed on the vector field. We then prove the global attractivity and the convergence rate of solutions to such systems (in the case when the orders of fractional derivatives are equal, the convergence rate of solutions is sharp and optimal). To our knowledge, these kinds of results are new contributions to the qualitative theory of multi-order fractional positive systems and they seem to have been unknown before in the literature. As a consequence of this result, we obtain the convergence of solutions toward a non-trivial equilibrium point in an ecosystem model (a particular class of fractional-order Kolmogorov systems). Finally, some numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear ODE System for the Unsteady Hydrodynamic Force -- A New Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a reduced-order model for the instantaneous hydrodynamic force on a cylinder. The model consists of a system of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which can be integrated in time to yield very accurate histories of the resultant force and its direction. In contrast to several existing models, the proposed model considers the actual (total) hydrodynamic force rather than its perpendicular or parallel projection (the lift and drag), and captures the complete force rather than the oscillatory part only. We study and provide descriptions of the relationship between the model parameters, evaluated utilizing results from numerical simulations, and the Reynolds number so that the model can be used at any arbitrary value within the considered range of 100 to 500 to provide accurate representation of the force without the need to perform time-consuming simulations and solving the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the flow field.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Machine Learning Approach for Adapting Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that span a low-dimensional subspace where the Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) reside. Because a governing equation is often parameterized by a set of parameters, challenges immediately arise when one would like to investigate how systems behave differently over the parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification and real-time operations). In this case, the POD basis needs to be updated so as to adapt ROM that accurately captures the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space. This paper proposes a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann Manifold that contains the optimal vector subspaces. A mapping is firstly found between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann Manifold. Then, a second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann Manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is projected to the Grassmann Manifold that yields the optimal subspace for the new parameter. The proposed statistical learning approach allows us to optimally estimate model parameters given data (i.e., the prediction/interpolation becomes problem-specific), and quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed pGP for adapting POD basis against parameter changes.</description>

      <title>Almost-Linear RNNs Yield Highly Interpretable Symbolic Codes in Dynamical Systems Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems (DS) theory is fundamental for many areas of science and engineering. It can provide deep insights into the behavior of systems evolving in time, as typically described by differential or recursive equations. A common approach to facilitate mathematical tractability and interpretability of DS models involves decomposing nonlinear DS into multiple linear DS separated by switching manifolds, i.e. piecewise linear (PWL) systems. PWL models are popular in engineering and a frequent choice in mathematics for analyzing the topological properties of DS. However, hand-crafting such models is tedious and only possible for very low-dimensional scenarios, while inferring them from data usually gives rise to unnecessarily complex representations with very many linear subregions. Here we introduce Almost-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs) which automatically and robustly produce most parsimonious PWL representations of DS from time series data, using as few PWL nonlinearities as possible. AL-RNNs can be efficiently trained with any SOTA algorithm for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), and naturally give rise to a symbolic encoding of the underlying DS that provably preserves important topological properties. We show that for the Lorenz and R\"ossler systems, AL-RNNs discover, in a purely data-driven way, the known topologically minimal PWL representations of the corresponding chaotic attractors. We further illustrate on two challenging empirical datasets that interpretable symbolic encodings of the dynamics can be achieved, tremendously facilitating mathematical and computational analysis of the underlying systems.</description>

      <title>QRT Map on a Bielliptic Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of mappings of the plane possessing a biquadratic invaiant, which is known collectively as QRT maps, is composed of two involutions, one preserving a vertical shift and the other preserving a horizontal shift in the plane. In this paper, we extend the map by replacing each shift by the group operation on each of two families of elliptic curves, whose product forms a bielliptic surface.</description>

      <title>Discrete empirical interpolation in the tensor t-product framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is a well-established approach, widely used for state reconstruction using sparse sensor/measurement data, nonlinear model reduction, and interpretable feature selection. We introduce the tensor t-product Q-DEIM (t-Q-DEIM), an extension of the DEIM framework for dealing with tensor-valued data. The proposed approach seeks to overcome one of the key drawbacks of DEIM, viz., the need for matricizing the data, which can distort any structural and/or geometric information. Our method leverages the recently developed tensor t-product algebra to avoid reshaping the data. In analogy with the standard DEIM, we formulate and solve a tensor-valued least-squares problem, whose solution is achieved through an interpolatory projection. We develop a rigorous, computable upper bound for the error resulting from the t-Q-DEIM approximation. Using five different tensor-valued datasets, we numerically illustrate the better approximation properties of t-Q-DEIM and the significant computational cost reduction it offers.</description>

      <title>Convergence to decorated L\'evy processes in non-Skorohod topologies for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for weak convergence to decorated L\'evy processes in enriched spaces of c\`adl\`ag functions for vector-valued processes arising in deterministic systems. Applications include uniformly expanding maps and unbounded observables as well as nonuniformly expanding/hyperbolic maps with bounded observables. The latter includes intermittent maps and dispersing billiards with flat cusps. In many of these examples, convergence fails in all of the Skorohod topologies. Moreover, the enriched space picks up details of excursions that are not recorded by Skorohod or Whitt topologies.</description>

Abstract: It is known that hyperbolic linear delay difference equations are shadowable on the half-line. In this paper, we prove the converse and hence the equivalence between hyperbolicity and the positive shadowing property for the following two classes of linear delay difference equations: (a)~for nonautonomous equations with finite delays and uniformly bounded compact coefficient operators in (possibly infinite-dimensional) Banach spaces, (b)~for Volterra difference equations with infinite delay in finite dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a state-dependent delay-differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of a scalar differential equation with threshold state-dependent delayed feedback. This equation arises as a simplification of a gene regulatory model. There are two monotone nonlinearities in the model: one describes the dependence of delay on state, and the other is the feedback nonlinearity. Both increasing and decreasing nonlinearities are considered. Our analysis is exhaustive both analytically and numerically as we examine the bifurcations of the system for various combinations of increasing and decreasing nonlinearities. We identify rich bifurcation patterns including Bautin, Bogdanov-Takens, cusp, fold, homoclinic, and Hopf bifurcations whose existence depend on the derivative signs of nonlinearities. Our analysis confirms many of these patterns in the limit where the nonlinearities are switch-like and change their value abruptly at a threshold. Perhaps one of the most surprising findings is the existence of a Hopf bifurcation to a periodic solution when the nonlinearity is monotone increasing and the time delay is a decreasing function of the state variable--something that is impossible in the case of a constant delay.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity for representations via self-joinings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a connected simple real algebraic group $G_1$. We discuss a rigidity problem for discrete faithful representations $\rho:\Gamma\to G_2$ and a surprising role played by higher rank conformal measures of the associated self-joining group. Our approach recovers rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia and Yue, as well as applies to Anosov representations, including Hitchin representations. More precisely, for a given representation $\rho$ with a boundary map $f$ defined on the limit set $\Lambda$, we ask whether the extendability of $\rho$ to $G$ can be detected by the property that $f$ pushes forward some $\Gamma$-conformal measure class $[\nu_\Gamma]$ to a $\rho(\Gamma)$-conformal measure class $[\nu_{\rho(\Gamma)}]$. When $\Gamma$ is of divergence type in a rank one group or when $\rho$ arises from an Anosov representation, we give an affirmative answer by showing that if the self-joining $\Gamma_\rho=(\text{id} \times \rho)(\Gamma)$ is Zariski dense in $G_1\times G_2$, then the push-forward measures $(\text{id}\times f)_*\nu_\Gamma$ and $(f^{-1}\times \text{id})_*\nu_{\rho(\Gamma)}$, which are higher rank $\Gamma_\rho$-conformal measures, cannot be in the same measure class.</description>
