      <title>Improvement of system identification of stochastic systems via Koopman generator and locally weighted expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of equations from data is of interest in physics. One of the famous methods is the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which utilizes sparse estimation techniques to estimate equations from data. Recently, a method based on the Koopman operator has been developed; the generator extended dynamic mode decomposition (gEDMD) estimates a time evolution generator of dynamical and stochastic systems. However, a naive application of the gEDMD algorithm could not work well for stochastic differential equations because of the noise effects in the data. Hence, the estimation based on conditional expectation values is practical, in which we approximate the first and second derivatives on each coordinate. A naive approach is the usage of locally weighted expectations. We show that the naive locally weighted expectation is not enough because of the nonlinear behavior of the underlying system. As for the improvement, we apply the clustering method in two ways; one is to reduce the effective number of data, and the other is to capture local information more accurately. We demonstrate the improvement of the proposed method for the double-well potential system with state-dependent noise.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cyclic Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic contractions generalize the usual contractivities in metric spaces and $b$-MSs. In this paper, we enhance several fixed point theorems related to cyclic (i) Banach self-maps, (ii) Chatterjea contractivities, (iii) Kannan self-mappings, (iv) \'{C}iri\'c and Hardy-Rogers, and (v) Reich contractions including local versions in $b$-metric spaces while also delineating the associated dynamics. Especially noteworthy is the expansion of the results concerning both fixed and periodic points, which are substantiated across a wider spectrum of ratio values for the aforementioned cyclic contractions within this class of spaces. Additionally, the convergence of Picard iterations towards the fixed point is rigorously established.</description>

      <title>Some results on s-limit shadowing and Li-Yorke type chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [13], for any continuous self-map of a compact metric space with s-limit shadowing, by using a $G_\delta$-partition of the phase space, a global description of Li-Yorke type chaos (with respect to several particular Furstenberg families) is obtained. In this paper, we complement the results in [13] by some results concerning the s-limit shadowing and general Furstenberg families. An example is also given to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Modelling the dynamics of online food delivery services on the spread of food-borne diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deterministic mathematical model for the transmission of food-borne diseases in a population consisting of humans and flies. We employ the Caputo operator to examine the impact of governmental actions and online food delivery services on the transmission of food-borne diseases. The proposed model investigates important aspects such as positivity, boundedness, disease-free equilibrium, basic reproduction number and sensitivity analysis. The existence and uniqueness of a solution for the initial value problem is established using Banach and Schauder type fixed point theorems. Functional techniques are employed to demonstrate the stability of the proposed model under the Hyers-Ulam condition. For an approximate solution, the iterative fractional order Predictor-Corrector scheme is utilized. The simulation of this scheme is conducted using Matlab as the numeric computing environment, with various fractional order values ranging from 0.75 to 1. Over time, all compartments demonstrate convergence and stability. The numerical simulations highlight the necessity for the government to implement the most effective food safety control interventions. These measures could involve food safety awareness and training campaigns targeting restaurant managers, staff members involved in online food delivery, as well as food delivery personnel.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model to assess the impact of contact rate and environment factor on transmission dynamics of rabies in humans and dogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical model to understand how rabies spreads among humans, free-range, and domestic dogs. By analyzing the model, we discovered that there are equilibrium points representing both disease-free and endemic states. We calculated the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_{0}$, using the next generation matrix method. When $\mathcal{R}_{0}&lt;1$, the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable, whereas when $\mathcal{R}_{0}&gt;1$, the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. To identify the most influential parameters in disease transmission, we used the normalized forward sensitivity index. Our simulations revealed that the contact rates between the infectious agent and humans, free-range dogs, and domestic dogs have the most significant impact on rabies transmission. The study also examines how periodic changes in transmission rates affect the disease dynamics, emphasizing the importance of transmission frequency and amplitude on the patterns observed in rabies spread. Therefore, the study proposes that to mitigate the factors most strongly linked to disease sensitivity, effective disease control measures should primarily prioritize on reducing the population of both free-range and domestic dogs in open environments.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics and Time-Optimal Control Studies for Additional Food provided Holling Type-III Mutually Interfering Prey-Predator Systems with Applications to Pest Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a prey-predator model exhibiting Holling type-III functional response among mutually interfering predators to assess the effects of provision of additional food to natural enemies in altering pest dynamics. We derive and study both the non-additional food provided system (initial system) and additional food provided system mathematically and through extensive numerical simulations. We prove the positivity and boundedness of the solutions of both the systems. We perform an extensive existence and stability analysis of various equilibrium points exhibited by both the systems. We discuss the global dynamics and stability behavior exhibited by both the systems with respect to crucial parameters using numerical methods. Considering the quality and quantity of additional food as control parameters, we framed and characterized the time optimal control problems. We further simulated these time optimal problems using numerical optimization techniques. Our theoretical and numerical investigations reveal that the provision of suitable choice of additional food steers the system to a prey-elimination state, leading to a pest-regulated ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Turbulent homeomorphisms and the topological snail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological snail is a geometric universal plane object, described by matrices in the special linear group with integer coefficients. It has many nice properties. From a dynamical point of view, it gives a description of the set of fixed points and periodic obits of turbulent homeomorphims in the plane. Those homeomorphisms are the truly complicated one. They have many fixed points and periodic orbits, as much as the trace of the turbulence matrix that caracterizes their action on a finite invariant set. The topological snail generally gives a map of the fixed points and periodic orbits of a such homeomorphims. One can compute their indexes and turbulent topological types, and different Nielsen's classes of fixed points naturally give a minoration of the topological entropy of the considered homeomorphisms by the logarithm of the spectral radius of the turbulence matrix. One even get a dynamical interpretation and proof of the extension of the Fermat' theorem to matrices. I first described the topological snail and its properties at my conference the 31st of may 2024 in Paris, in the case of a purely turbulent homeomorphism, with an invariant set of three points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-expanding random walks on the space of affine lattices and establish a new classification theorem for stationary measures. Further, we prove a theorem that relates the genericity with respect to these random walks to Birkhoff genericity. Finally, we apply these theorems to obtain several results in inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation, especially on fractals.</description>

      <title>Recurrence in collective dynamics: From the hyperspace to fuzzy dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study for a dynamical system $f:X\longrightarrow X$ some of the principal topological recurrence-kind properties with respect to the induced maps $\overline{f}:\mathcal{K}(X)\longrightarrow\mathcal{K}(X)$, on the hyperspace of non-empty compact subsets of $X$, and $\hat{f}:\mathcal{F}(X)\longrightarrow\mathcal{F}(X)$, on the space of normal fuzzy sets consisting of the upper-semicontinuous functions $u:X\longrightarrow [0,1]$ with compact support and such that $u^{-1}(\{1\})\neq\varnothing$. In particular, we characterize the properties of topological and multiple recurrence for the extended systems $(\mathcal{K}(X),\overline{f})$ and $(\mathcal{F}(X),\hat{f})$. Special attention is given to the case where the underlying space is completely metrizable, for which we obtain some stronger point-recurrence equivalences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop non-Archimedean techniques to analyze the degeneration of a sequence of rational maps of the complex projective line. We provide an alternative to Luo's method which was based on ultra-limits of the hyperbolic 3-space. We build hybrid spaces using Berkovich theory which enable us to prove the convergence of equilibrium measures, and to determine the asymptotics of Lyapunov exponents.</description>

      <title>Full Lyapunov Exponents spectrum with Deep Learning from single-variable time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study if a Deep Learning technique can be used to obtain an approximated value of the Lyapunov exponents of a dynamical system. Moreover, we want to know if Machine Learning techniques are able, once trained, to provide the complete Lyapunov exponents spectrum with just single-variable time series. We train a Convolutional Neural Network and we use the resulting network to approximate the complete spectrum using the time series of just one variable from the studied systems (Lorenz system and coupled Lorenz system). The results are quite stunning as all the values are well approximated with only partial data. This strategy permits to speed up the complete analysis of the systems and also to study the hyperchaotic dynamics in the coupled Lorenz system.</description>

      <title>Algebraic billiards in the Fermat hyperbola</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic billiards in a plane curve of degree $d \geq 2$ is a rational correspondence on a surface. The dynamical degree is an algebraic analogue of entropy that measures intersection-theoretic complexity. We compute a lower bound on the dynamical degree of billiards in the generic algebraic curve of degree $d$ over any field of characteristic coprime to $2d$, complementing the upper bound in our previous work. To do this, we specialize to a highly symmetric curve that we call the Fermat hyperbola. Over $\mathbb{C}$, we construct an algebraically stable model for this billiard via an iterated blowup. Over general fields, we compute the growth of a particular big and nef divisor.</description>

      <title>Attractor and its self-similarities for an IFS over arbitrary sub-shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a compact metric space $X$, and let $\mathcal{F}=\{f_1,\,f_2,\ldots,\, f_k\}$ be a set of contracting and continuous self maps on $X$. Let $\Sigma$ be a sub-shift on $k$ symbols, and let $\Sigma_k$ be the full shift.
  Define $\mathcal{L}_n(\Sigma)$ as the set of words of length $n$ in $\Sigma$. For $u=u_1\cdots u_n\in \mathcal{L}_n(\Sigma)$, set $f_u:=f_{u_n}\circ\cdots \circ f_{u_1}$ and $H^n(\cdot):=\cup_{u \in \mathcal{L}_{n}(\Sigma_k)} f_{u}(\cdot)$.
  When $\Sigma=\Sigma_k$, $H^n(\cdot)$ is the $n$th iteration of the Hutchinson's operator, and there exists a compact set
  $S= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} H^n(A)$ for any compact $A\subseteq X$ with $H^n(S)=S$ (self-similarity criteria) for $n\in\N$.
  For arbitrary $\Sigma$, the above limit exists; but it is not necessarily true that $H^n(S)=S$. Sufficient conditions on $\Sigma$ are provided to have $H^n(S)=S$ for all or some $n\in\N$, and then the dynamics of $S$ under the admissible iterations of $f_i$'s defined by $\Sigma$ are investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this note is to point out by means of counter-examples that some arguments of the proofs of two theorems about a "half variational principle" for multivalued maps, formulated recently by Vivas and Sirvent [Metric entropy for set-valued maps, Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst. Ser. B, 27 (2022), pp. 6589-6604], are false and that our corrected versions require rather restrictive additional assumptions. Nevertheless, we will be able to establish the full variational principle for a special subclass of multivalued lower semicontinuous maps with convex compact values on a compact subset of a Banach space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will consider various definitions of topological entropy for multivalued nonautonomous dynamical systems in compact Hausdorff spaces. Some of them can deal with arbitrary multivalued maps, i.e. when no restrictions are imposed on them. For upper semicontinuous multivalued maps, we still investigate especially their relationship to the parametric topological entropy of the induced (possibly discontinuous) dynamical systems in hyperspaces. A comparison of various sorts of definitions can allow us, rather than direct calculations, to make easier the entropy estimates. Several illustrative examples are supplied.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative orbital stability of stochastic patterns in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastic perturbations of PDEs which have special pattern solutions, such as (nonlinear) travelling waves, solitons, and spiral waves. We show orbital stability of these patterns on a timescale which is exponential in the inverse square of the noise amplitude. We systematically treat equations with noncommutative symmetry groups, and show how the noncommutativity affects the motion of the pattern. This is done by introducing a new method to track the (generalized) phase of the pattern. Furthermore, we demonstrate how orbital stability arises from a mismatch of symmetry between the pattern and the equation. Our phase tracking method does not rely on a Hilbert space structure. This allows us to show stability in general Banach spaces, and to treat noise with lower regularity than before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relations always play an important role in the study of topological dynamics. Proximal, distal and almost periodic relations are well studied in literature. We further this direction and analogously study the strongly proximal and weakly distal relations.
  This gives a new class of flows - the weakly distal flows. We observe that the well known Morse-Thue substitution flows and Chacon transformations are weakly distal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem. Later, Loyd showed a disjoint form with the Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem. Recently, the author and his coauthors proved some ergodic theorems over squarefree numbers related to these results. In this paper, building on the previous work, we will derive the analogues of Bergelson-Richter's theorem, Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem and Loyd's theorem over $k$-full numbers for any integer $k\geq2$.</description>

      <title>On the minimal number of closed geodesics on positively curved Finsler spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we proved that for every Finsler metric on $S^n$ $(n\ge 4)$ with reversibility $\lambda$ and flag curvature $K$ satisfying $(\frac{2n-3}{n-1})^2 (\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+1})^2&lt;K\le 1$ and $ \lambda&lt;\frac{n-1}{n-2} $, there exist at least $n$ prime closed geodesics on $(S^n,F)$, which solved a conjecture of Katok and Anosov for such positivley curved spheres when $n$ is even. Furthermore, if the number of closed geodesics on such positively curved Finsler $S^n$ is finite, then there exist at least $2\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]-1$ non-hyperbolic closed geodesics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Unknown Stochastic Dynamical System Subject to External Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for learning unknown nonautonomous stochastic dynamical system, i.e., stochastic system subject to time dependent excitation or control signals. Our basic assumption is that the governing equations for the stochastic system are unavailable. However, short bursts of input/output (I/O) data consisting of certain known excitation signals and their corresponding system responses are available. When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data. Our method has two key components: (1) a local approximation of the training I/O data to transfer the learning into a parameterized form; and (2) a generative model to approximate the underlying unknown stochastic flow map in distribution. After presenting the method in detail, we present a comprehensive set of numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, especially for long-term system predictions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Some Logistic Maps and the Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain the relation between the $r=1$ logistic map $x_{i+1}=rx_i(1-x_i)$, $x_i\in\mathbb R$, $i=0,1,\ldots$, $r&gt;0$ and $x_0\geq0$, and the RG flow in the multiscale analysis of zero fixed point, asymptotic free QFT models as e.g. the ultraviolet (1+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu model and QCD, and the infrared $\phi^4_4$. We obtain the asymptotics of the mapping, showing an inverse power decay to the fixed point $x^*=0$ Gaussian fixed point, with logarithmic-like corrections. This asymptotics is independent of the initial condition $x_0\in(0,1)$ (so, there is no constraint for $x_0$ to be small, as usual in QFT models), and only depends on the lowest orders in a polynomial perturbation. In asymptotic free QFT, this means that knowing the RG $\beta$ function expansion up to higher orders in the coupling does not improve our knowledge of the flow asymptotics. A comparison with an ODE with continuous time is made by analyzing stability of the solution with higher order monomial perturbations. We also obtain the asymptotics for $0&lt;r&lt;1$. Also, our methods work when $r\in(1,3]$. It is known, but without detailed asymptotics, that all trajectories with initial condition $x_0\in(-1,1)$ converge to the fixed point $x^*=(r-1)/r$. For the super attractive case $r=2$, we obtain an explicit exact solution with an exploding nonconstant exponential decay rate to the $x^*=1/2$ fixed point. Our methods include the use of iterations, a discrete version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, a discrete version of the integrating factor method for 1st order linear ODEs and, sometimes, a scaling transformation. We do not use the Banach contraction mapping theorem, which only provides an upper bound on the asymptotics. We expect that our methods apply to determine the asymptotics of the logistic map for a wider range of parameters, where other fixed points are present.</description>

      <title>Sub-Riemannian geodesics on the Heisenberg 3D nil-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the projection of the left-invariant sub-Riemannian structure on the 3D Heisenberg group $G$ to the Heisenberg 3D nil-manifold~$M$ -- the compact homogeneous space of $G$ by the discrete Heisenberg group.
  First we describe dynamical properties of the geodesic flow for $M$: periodic and dense orbits, and a dynamical characterization of the normal Hamiltonian flow of Pontryagin maximum principle. Then we obtain sharp twoside bounds of sub-Riemannian balls and distance in~$G$, and on this basis we estimate the cut time for sub-Riemannian geodesics in $M$.</description>

      <title>Volume of algebraically integrable foliations and locally stable families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the volume of algebraically integrable foliations and locally stable families. We show that, for any canonical algebraically integrable foliation, its volume belongs to a discrete set depending only on its rank and the volume of its general leaves. In particular, if the foliation is of general type, then its volume has a positive lower bound depending only on its rank and the volume of its general leaves. This implies some special cases of a question posed by Cascini, Hacon, and Langer.
  As a consequence, we show that the relative volume of a stable family with a normal generic fiber belongs to a discrete set if the dimension and the volume of its general fibers are bounded. Log versions of the aforementioned theorems are also provided and proved.</description>

      <title>Effective atypical intersections and applications to orbit closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying setting for dealing with monodromically atypical intersections that goes beyond the usual Zilber-Pink conjecture. In particular we obtain a new proof of finiteness of the maximal atypical orbit closures in each stratum of translation surfaces $\Omega \mathcal{M}_g (\kappa)$, as given by Eskin, Filip, and Wright. We also describe a concrete algorithm, implementable in principle on a computer, which provably computes all maximal orbit closures which are 'atypical' in a sense described by Filip. The same methods also give a general algorithm for computing atypical special loci associated to systems of differential equations, and in particular give an effective and o-minimal free proof of the geometric Zilber-Pink conjecture variations of mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>Backstepping control for the sterile mosquitoes technique: stabilization of extinction equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of a mosquito population using the sterile insect technique is considered. Building on a model-based approach, where the control input is the release rate of sterilized males, we propose a non-negative backstepping control law capable of globally stabilizing the extinction equilibrium of the system. A simulation study supports and validates the theoretical findings, showing the efficacy of the approach both on a reduced model, used for control design, and on a complete model of the mosquito population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Parrondo's paradox in susceptible-infectious-susceptible dynamics over periodic temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many social and biological networks periodically change over time with daily, weekly, and other cycles. Thus motivated, we formulate and analyze susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) epidemic models over temporal networks with periodic schedules. More specifically, we assume that the temporal network consists of a cycle of alternately used static networks, each with a given duration. We show Parrondo's paradox behavior in this model, with which the periodic alternation of two static networks that are supra-threshold (i.e., above the epidemic threshold of the SIS model) yields a sub-threshold dynamics (i.e., with the number of infectious nodes exponentially decaying over time) in many cases. We find community structure to play an important role in shaping this phenomenon, and we study its dependence on the connectivity between and number of communities. Our findings associate such paradoxical behavior with anti-phase oscillatory behavior of the number of infectious nodes in different communities of the network.</description>

Abstract: In 2000, Margulis proved that any group of homeomorphisms of the circle either preserves a probabilty measure on the circle or contains a free subgroup in two generators, which is reminiscent of the Tits alternatve for linear groups. In this article, we prove an analogous statement for groups of locally monotonic homeomorphisms of a compact subset of R.</description>

      <title>Gluing Dynamics: $\varepsilon$-Precision in Solving a Non-Archimedean Inverse Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research proposes a new method for approximating the solution of the inverse problem of finding a rational function that generates known local dynamics within distinct, disjoint closed balls in non-Archimedean fields. Although our approach is not directly influenced by Runge's theorem for approximating analytic maps in complex settings, it shares similarities by adapting these ideas to the non-Archimedean context. We aim to connect local dynamic behaviors, similar to dynamic surgery, without using quasiconformal but rational mappings. Our main theorem and corollaries present an algorithmic technique to construct a rational function, denoted as \(F_\varepsilon\), that synthesizes specified local dynamics with an \(\varepsilon\)-precision parameter globally.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions to nonlinear ODEs via spectral power series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solutions to most nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) rely on numerical solvers, but this gives little insight into the nature of the trajectories and is relatively expensive to compute. In this paper, we derive analytic solutions to a class of nonlinear, homogeneous ODEs with linear and quadratic terms on the right-hand side. We formulate a power series expansion of each state variable, whose function depends on the eigenvalues of the linearized system, and solve for the coefficients using some linear algebra and combinatorics. Various experiments exhibit quickly decaying coefficients, such that a good approximation to the true solution consists of just a few terms.</description>

Abstract: People sometimes change their opinions when they discuss things with other people. Researchers study mathematical models of opinions to explore how people influence each other through their social interactions. In today's digital world, these models can help us learn how to promote accurate information and reduce unwanted influence. In this article, we discuss a simple mathematical model that looks at opinion changes from social interactions. We briefly describe what opinion models can tell us and how researchers try to make them more realistic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an oriented smooth manifold, and $\operatorname{Homeo}(M,\omega)$ the group of measure preserving homeomorphisms of $M$, where $\omega$ is a finite measure induced by a volume form. In this paper we define volume and Euler classes in bounded cohomology of an infinite dimensional transformation group $\operatorname{Homeo}_0(M,\omega)$ and $\operatorname{Homeo}(M,\omega)$ respectively, and in several cases prove their non-triviality. More precisely, we define:
  - Volume classes in $\operatorname{H}_b^n(\operatorname{Homeo}_0(M,\omega))$ where $M$ is a hyperbolic manifold of dimension $n$.
  - Euler classes in $\operatorname{H}_b^2(\operatorname{Homeo}(S,\omega))$ where $S$ is a closed hyperbolic surface.
  We show that Euler classes have positive norms for any closed hyperbolic $S$ and volume classes have positive norms for all hyperbolic surfaces and certain hyperbolic $3$-manifolds, and hence they are non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Relative Equilibria of Mechanical Systems with Rotational Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of classifying relative equilibria for mechanical systems with rotational symmetry. We divide relative equilibria into two natural groups: a generic class which we call normal, and a non-generic abnormal class. The eigenvalues of the locked inertia tensor descend to shape-space and endow it with the geometric structure of a 3-web with the property that any normal relative equilibrium occurs as a critical point of the potential restricted to a leaf from the web. To demonstrate the utility of this web structure we show how the spherical 3-body problem gives rise to a web of Cayley cubics on the 3-sphere, and use this to fully classify the relative equilibria for the case of equal masses.</description>
