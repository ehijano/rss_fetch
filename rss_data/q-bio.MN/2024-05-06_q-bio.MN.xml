      <title>Stress-induced Eukaryotic Translational Regulatory Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eukaryotic protein synthesis process entails intricate stages governed by diverse mechanisms to tightly regulate translation. Translational regulation during stress is pivotal for maintaining cellular homeostasis, ensuring the accurate expression of essential proteins crucial for survival. This selective translational control mechanism is integral to cellular adaptation and resilience under adverse conditions. This review manuscript explores various mechanisms involved in selective translational regulation, focusing on mRNA-specific and global regulatory processes. Key aspects of translational control include translation initiation, which is often a rate-limiting step, and involves the formation of the eIF4F complex and recruitment of mRNA to ribosomes. Regulation of translation initiation factors, such as eIF4E, eIF4E2, and eIF2, through phosphorylation and interactions with binding proteins, modulates translation efficiency under stress conditions. This review also highlights the control of translation initiation through factors like the eIF4F complex and the ternary complex and also underscores the importance of eIF2{\alpha} phosphorylation in stress granule formation and cellular stress responses. Additionally, the impact of amino acid deprivation, mTOR signaling, and ribosome biogenesis on translation regulation and cellular adaptation to stress is also discussed. Understanding the intricate mechanisms of translational regulation during stress provides insights into cellular adaptation mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for various diseases, offering valuable avenues for addressing conditions associated with dysregulated protein synthesis.</description>

      <title>A Simple Comparison of Biochemical Systems Theory and Metabolic Control Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores some basic concepts of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) and Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), two frameworks developed to understand the behavior of biochemical networks. Initially introduced by Savageau, BST focuses on system stability and employs power laws in modeling biochemical systems. On the other hand, MCA, pioneered by authors such as Kacser and Burns and Heinrich and Rapoport, emphasizes linearization of the governing equations and describes relationships (known as theorems) between different measures. Despite apparent differences, both frameworks are shown to be equivalent in many respects. Through a simple example of a linear chain, the paper demonstrates how BST and MCA yield identical results when analyzing steady-state behavior and logarithmic gains within biochemical pathways. This comparative analysis highlights the interchangeability of concepts such as kinetic orders, elasticities and other logarithmic gains.</description>
