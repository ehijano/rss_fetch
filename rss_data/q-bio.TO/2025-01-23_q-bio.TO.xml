      <title>A One Dimensional (1D) Computational Fluid Dynamics Study of Fontan-Associated Liver Disease (FALD)</title>

Abstract: Fontan-Associated Liver Disease (FALD) is a disorder arising from hemodynamic changes and venous congestion in the liver. This disease is prominent in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Although HLHS patients typically survive into adulthood, they have reduced cardiac output due to their univentricular physiology (i.e., a Fontan circuit). As a result, they have insufficient blood delivery to the liver. In comparison, patients with double outlet right ventricle (DORV), also having a univentricular circuit, have lower incidence of FALD. In this study, we use a patient-specific, one-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (1D-CFD) model to predict hemodynamics in the liver of an HLHS patient and compare predictions with an age- and size-matched DORV control patient. Additionally, we simulate FALD conditions in the HLHS patient to predict hemodynamic changes across various stages of disease progression. Our results show that the HLHS patient has a higher portal venous pressure compared to the DORV patient. This difference is exacerbated as FALD conditions progress. The wall shear stress (WSS) is also higher than normal for the HLHS patient, suggesting vascular remodeling. WSS decreases slightly under FALD conditions, consistent with the development of portal hypertension. Perfusion analysis gives insight into regions of liver tissue at risk for fibrosis development, showing increasing pressures and reduced flow throughout the liver tissue fed by the portal vein under FALD conditions. Our results provide insight into the specific hemodynamic changes in Fontan circulation that can cause FALD.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Brain Image Translation using Transfer Learning from Generic Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various neurological disorders, providing valuable insights into the structure and function of the brain. Techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) enable non-invasive visualization of the brain, aiding in the understanding of brain anatomy, abnormalities, and functional connectivity. However, cost and radiation dose may limit the acquisition of specific image modalities, so medical image synthesis can be used to generate required medical images without actual addition. In the medical domain, where obtaining labeled medical images is labor-intensive and expensive, addressing data scarcity is a major challenge. Recent studies propose using transfer learning to overcome this issue. This involves adapting pre-trained CycleGAN models, initially trained on non-medical data, to generate realistic medical images. In this work, transfer learning was applied to the task of MR-CT image translation and vice versa using 18 pre-trained non-medical models, and the models were fine-tuned to have the best result. The models' performance was evaluated using four widely used image quality metrics: Peak-signal-to-noise-ratio, Structural Similarity Index, Universal Quality Index, and Visual Information Fidelity. Quantitative evaluation and qualitative perceptual analysis by radiologists demonstrate the potential of transfer learning in medical imaging and the effectiveness of the generic pre-trained model. The results provide compelling evidence of the model's exceptional performance, which can be attributed to the high quality and similarity of the training images to actual human brain images. These results underscore the significance of carefully selecting appropriate and representative training images to optimize performance in brain image analysis tasks.</description>
