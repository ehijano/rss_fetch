      <title>Application of a Virtual Imaging Framework for Investigating a Deep Learning-Based Reconstruction Method for 3D Quantitative Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is a promising imaging modality for estimating physiological parameters such as blood oxygen saturation. However, developing robust qPACT reconstruction methods remains challenging due to computational demands, modeling difficulties, and experimental uncertainties. Learning-based methods have been proposed to address these issues but remain largely unvalidated. Virtual imaging (VI) studies are essential for validating such methods early in development, before proceeding to less-controlled phantom or in vivo studies. Effective VI studies must employ ensembles of stochastically generated numerical phantoms that accurately reflect relevant anatomy and physiology. Yet, most prior VI studies for qPACT relied on overly simplified phantoms. In this work, a realistic VI testbed is employed for the first time to assess a representative 3D learning-based qPACT reconstruction method for breast imaging. The method is evaluated across subject variability and physical factors such as measurement noise and acoustic aberrations, offering insights into its strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>Seeing More, Treating Smarter: Role of Long-Axial Field-of-View PET-CT in The Evolution of Theranostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT has the potential to redefine the role of molecular imaging in theranostics by making multiparametric whole-body (MPWB) imaging and predictive dosimetry more clinically feasible. Compared to conventional PET systems, LAFOV scanners provide dramatic gains in sensitivity and coverage, allowing dynamic acquisitions, delayed imaging, and dual-tracer protocols within clinically feasible workflows. These advances supply the quantitative data required for physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and the creation of theranostic digital twins, supporting true personalization of radiopharmaceutical therapy.</description>

      <title>Human brain high-resolution diffusion MRI with optimized slice-by-slice B0 field shimming in head-only high-performance gradient MRI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to propose a brain tissue-selective, optimized slice-by-slice B0 field shimming for high-resolution brain diffusion MRI. We incorporated actual gradient fields of X, Y, and Z gradient coils in the calculation of the shimming coefficients in dynamic slice-by-slice B0 field shimming to minimize B0 field inhomogeneity (i.e., Delta B0) in deep-learning segmented brain tissues. Diffusion MRI with oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) at 55 Hz and pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) (approximated at 0 Hz) were obtained in phantoms and healthy volunteers using a head-only high-performance gradient 3T MRI system. In each diffusion MRI acquisition, standard static volumetric shimming and the proposed shimming method were applied separately, and mean/axial/radial diffusivities (MD/AD/RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were estimated. In phantom, the root-mean-square of Delta B0 in areas with high gradient nonlinearity was reduced by 7 Hz when incorporating actual gradient field in dynamic shimming. Compared to static shimming, dynamic shimming reduced root-mean-square of voxel displacement of each slice by a maximum of 5-10 voxels in single-shot EPI acquisition at 1-2 mm in-plane resolution in phantom, and a maximum of 3 voxels in human brains. Improved accuracy of MD/AD/RD/FA in the superior region of the brain, brainstem, and cerebellum were observed by applying dynamic shimming and/or two-shot EPI acquisition. MD(55 Hz)-MD(0 Hz) showed higher values in T2 FSE hypo-intensity region by applying dynamic shimming. We concluded that diffusion MRI with brain tissue-selective, dynamic slice-by-slice B0 effectively improves the accuracy of diffusivity characterization in high-resolution images.</description>

      <title>Transient thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic study of herringbone-grooved mechanical face seal during start-up stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive numerical solution is developed for the transient thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic (TEHD) characteristics of mechanical face seals. Transient lubrication features of the fluid film, transient thermal deformation features of the seal rings, dynamic behavior, and rough faces contacting are coupled. The finite volume method is utilized for the fluid film solution, and the Duhamel's principle contributes to calculation of the time-varying solid properties. An overall flowchart for the numerical solution is established, with an approach of Parallel Dual Time Steps (PDTS approach) proposed and utilized for the explicit time solver. Both of the efficiency and accuracy of the PDTS approach are evaluated by comparing with the reference. An outer-herringbone-grooved face seal in a start-up stage is studied. The simultaneously existing physical effects of the face expansion and the seal ring movement are successfully simulated with the proposed method. Neglecting viscosity-temperature effect and convergent gap forming could underestimate the load-carrying capacity of the fluid film; smaller contacting force but larger maximum contacting pressure are found comparing with the THD and HD results; performance keeps varying at steady speed due to thermal lag effect. The proposed numerical solution could be impactful for mechanism analyzing of the undesirable running of mechanical face seals related to the transient TEHD effects.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Brain Biomechanics Prediction with Neural Operators: Toward Clinically Deployable Traumatic Brain Injury Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health concern, with over 69 million cases annually worldwide. Finite element (FE) models offer high-fidelity predictions of brain deformation but are computationally expensive, requiring hours per simulation and limiting their clinical utility for rapid decision-making. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art neural operator (NO) architectures for rapid, patient-specific prediction of brain displacement fields, aiming to enable real-time TBI modeling in clinical and translational settings. We formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning problem, mapping subject-specific anatomical MRI, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) stiffness maps, and demographic features to full-field 3D brain displacement predictions. Four architectures - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Factorized FNO (F-FNO), Multi-Grid FNO (MG-FNO), and Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) were trained and evaluated on 249 MRE datasets across physiologically relevant frequencies (20 - 90 Hz). MG-FNO achieved the highest accuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3\% spatial fidelity) and preserved fine-scale features, while F-FNO converged 2$\times$ faster than standard FNO. DeepONet offered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s) with a 7$\times$ computational speed-up over MG-FNO, suggesting utility for embedded or edge computing applications. All NOs reduced computation time from hours to milliseconds without sacrificing anatomical realism. NOs provide an efficient, resolution-invariant approach for predicting brain deformation, opening the door to real-time, patient-specific TBI risk assessment, clinical triage support, and optimization of protective equipment. These results highlight the potential for NO-based digital twins of the human brain, enabling scalable, on-demand biomechanical modeling in both clinical and population health contexts.</description>

      <title>Scintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes for ultrafast timing over keV-GeV energy scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurement of radiation has long played a vital role in a wide range of research and industrial fields, from fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model to medical imaging such as time-of-flight positron emission tomography. Developing radiation detectors that achieve high timing precision-on the order of a few tens of picoseconds-and energy measurement capabilities remains indispensable yet challenging. In this study, we developed two types of scintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (SCI-IMPs), one incorporating barium fluoride, and the other bismuth germanate, to enable simultaneous high-precision timing and energy measurements. To evaluate their performance over a wide energy range from keV- to GeV-scale, electron-positron annihilation gamma rays and cosmic ray muons were used. For energy measurements, both detectors achieved an energy resolution of approximately 35% at 511 keV. For timing measurements using 511 keV, coincidence time resolutions (CTRs) of approximately 50 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) were obtained for both detectors. In contrast, for cosmic ray muon experiments where cosmic ray muon energy is typically on the order of GeV, CTRs were measured to be 25.1 and 16.8 ps FWHM for barium fluoride- and bismuth germanate-based detectors, respectively. The versatile scintillator-integration technique established in this study can broaden the applicability of the newly developed SCI-IMPs. In particular, these results demonstrate that the developed detectors push the boundaries of timing performance while retaining energy measurement and hold promise for future applications in fundamental physics experiments and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise and spatial resolution in in-line imaging. 3. Optimization using a simple model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of optimization of propagation-based phase-contrast imaging setups is considered in the case of projection X-ray imaging and three-dimensional tomography with phase retrieval. For two-dimensional imaging, a simple model for a homogeneous edge feature embedded in a bulk sample is used to obtain analytical expressions for the image intensity. This model allows for explicit optimization of the geometrical parameters of the imaging setup and the choice of X-ray energy that maximizes the image contrast or the contrast-to-noise ratio. We also consider the question of optimization of the biomedical X-ray imaging quality characteristic which balances the contrast-to-noise against the spatial resolution and the radiation dose. In the three-dimensional case corresponding to propagation-based phase-contrast tomography with phase retrieval according to Paganin's method, the optimization of the imaging setup is studied with respect to the source size, the detector resolution, the geometrical magnification and the X-ray energy.</description>

      <title>Filling of incomplete sinograms from sparse PET detector configurations using a residual U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed, allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant step forward in medical imaging technology.</description>

      <title>Multisession Longitudinal Dynamic MRI Incorporating Patient-Specific Prior Image Information Across Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exams are often performed in clinical practice, offering shared anatomical and motion information across imaging sessions. However, existing reconstruction methods process each session independently without leveraging this valuable longitudinal information. In this work, we propose a novel concept of longitudinal dynamic MRI, which incorporates patient-specific prior images to exploit temporal correlations across sessions. This framework enables progressive acceleration of data acquisition and reduction of scan time as more imaging sessions become available. The concept is demonstrated using the 4D Golden-angle RAdial Sparse Parallel (GRASP) MRI, a state-of-the-art dynamic imaging technique. Longitudinal reconstruction is performed by concatenating multi-session time-resolved 4D GRASP datasets into an extended dynamic series, followed by a low-rank subspace-based reconstruction algorithm. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method. Results show that longitudinal 4D GRASP reconstruction consistently outperforms standard single-session reconstruction in image quality, while preserving inter-session variations. The approach demonstrated robustness to changes in anatomy, imaging intervals, and body contour, highlighting its potential for improving imaging efficiency and consistency in longitudinal MRI applications. More generally, this work suggests a new context-aware imaging paradigm in which the more we see a patient, the faster we can image.</description>
