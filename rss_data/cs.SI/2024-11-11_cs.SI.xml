      <title>A Guide to Misinformation Detection Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this problem, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of all of the 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as insufficient label quality, spurious correlations, or political bias. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. We discuss alternatives to mitigate this problem. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for obtaining higher quality data and conducting more effective evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection. All datasets and other artifacts are available at https://misinfo-datasets.complexdatalab.com/.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Epidemic Simulation Workflow for Submodular Intervention Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other recent global epidemics, epidemic simulation frameworks are gaining rapid significance. In this work, we present a workflow that will allow researchers to simulate the spread of an infectious disease under different intervention schemes. Our workflow is built using the Covasim simulator for COVID-19 alongside a network-based PREEMPT tool for vaccination. The Covasim simulator is a stochastic agent-based simulator with the capacity to test the efficacy of different intervention schemes. PREEMPT is a graph-theoretic approach that models epidemic intervention on a network using submodular optimization. By integrating the PREEMPT tool with the Covasim simulator, users will be able to test network diffusion based interventions for vaccination. The paper presents a description of this integrated workflow alongside preliminary results of our empirical evaluation for COVID-19.</description>

      <title>Content Quality vs. Attention Allocation: An LLM-Based Case Study in Peer-to-peer Mental Health Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of social media and peer-to-peer networks, users increasingly rely on crowdsourced responses for information and assistance. However, the mechanisms used to rank and promote responses often prioritize and end up biasing in favor of timeliness over quality, which may result in suboptimal support for help-seekers. We analyze millions of responses to mental health-related posts, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to assess the multi-dimensional quality of content, including relevance, empathy, and cultural alignment, among other aspects. Our findings reveal a mismatch between content quality and attention allocation: earlier responses - despite being relatively lower in quality - receive disproportionately high fractions of upvotes and visibility due to platform ranking algorithms. We demonstrate that the quality of the top-ranked responses could be improved by up to 39 percent, and even the simplest re-ranking strategy could significantly improve the quality of top responses, highlighting the need for more nuanced ranking mechanisms that prioritize both timeliness and content quality, especially emotional engagement in online mental health communities.</description>

      <title>Influencers' Reposts and Viral Diffusion: Prestige Bias in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cultural evolution theory suggests that prestige bias (whereby individuals preferentially learn from prestigious figures) has played a key role in human ecological success. However, its impact within online environments remains unclear, particularly regarding whether reposts by prestigious individuals amplify diffusion more effectively than reposts by non-influential users. Here, we analyzed over 55 million posts and 520 million reposts on Twitter (currently X) to examine whether users with high influence scores (hg-index) more effectively amplified the reach of others' content. Our findings indicate that posts shared by influencers were more likely to be further shared compared to those shared by non-influencers. This effect persisted over time, especially in viral posts. Moreover, a small group of highly influential users accounted for approximately half of the information flow within repost cascades. These findings demonstrate a prestige bias in information diffusion within digital society, suggesting that cognitive biases shape content spread through reposting.</description>

      <title>Exploring Relationships Between Cryptocurrency News Outlets and Influencers' Twitter Activity and Market Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Academics increasingly acknowledge the predictive power of social media for a wide variety of events and, more specifically, for financial markets. Anecdotal and empirical findings show that cryptocurrencies are among the financial assets that have been affected by news and influencers' activities on Twitter. However, the extent to which Twitter crypto influencer's posts about trading signals and their effect on market prices is mostly unexplored. In this paper, we use LLMs to uncover buy and not-buy signals from influencers and news outlets' Twitter posts and use a VAR analysis with Granger Causality tests and cross-correlation analysis to understand how these trading signals are temporally correlated with the top nine major cryptocurrencies' prices. Overall, the results show a mixed pattern across cryptocurrencies and temporal periods. However, we found that for the top three cryptocurrencies with the highest presence within news and influencer posts, their aggregated LLM-detected trading signal over the preceding 24 hours granger-causes fluctuations in their market prices, exhibiting a lag of at least 6 hours. In addition, the results reveal fundamental differences in how influencers and news outlets cover cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <title>Post-Hoc Robustness Enhancement in Graph Neural Networks with Conditional Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are nowadays the benchmark approach in graph representation learning, have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. While existing defense techniques primarily concentrate on the training phase of GNNs, involving adjustments to message passing architectures or pre-processing methods, there is a noticeable gap in methods focusing on increasing robustness during inference. In this context, this study introduces RobustCRF, a post-hoc approach aiming to enhance the robustness of GNNs at the inference stage. Our proposed method, founded on statistical relational learning using a Conditional Random Field, is model-agnostic and does not require prior knowledge about the underlying model architecture. We validate the efficacy of this approach across various models, leveraging benchmark node classification datasets.</description>

      <title>EUREKHA: Enhancing User Representation for Key Hackers Identification in Underground Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underground forums serve as hubs for cybercriminal activities, offering a space for anonymity and evasion of conventional online oversight. In these hidden communities, malicious actors collaborate to exchange illicit knowledge, tools, and tactics, driving a range of cyber threats from hacking techniques to the sale of stolen data, malware, and zero-day exploits. Identifying the key instigators (i.e., key hackers), behind these operations is essential but remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a novel method called EUREKHA (Enhancing User Representation for Key Hacker Identification in Underground Forums), designed to identify these key hackers by modeling each user as a textual sequence. This sequence is processed through a large language model (LLM) for domain-specific adaptation, with LLMs acting as feature extractors. These extracted features are then fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model user structural relationships, significantly improving identification accuracy. Furthermore, we employ BERTopic (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Topic Modeling) to extract personalized topics from user-generated content, enabling multiple textual representations per user and optimizing the selection of the most representative sequence. Our study demonstrates that fine-tuned LLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying key hackers. Additionally, when combined with GNNs, our model achieves significant improvements, resulting in approximately 6% and 10% increases in accuracy and F1-score, respectively, over existing methods. EUREKHA was tested on the Hack-Forums dataset, and we provide open-source access to our code.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise Interactions: Unveiling the Role of Higher-Order Interactions via Stepwise Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems, such as economic, social, biological, and ecological systems, usually feature interactions not only between pairwise entities but also among three or more entities. These multi-entity interactions are known as higher-order interactions. Hypergraph, as a mathematical tool, can effectively characterize higher-order interactions, where nodes denote entities and hyperedges represent interactions among multiple entities. Meanwhile, all higher-order interactions can also be projected into a number of lower-order interactions or even some pairwise interactions. Whether it is necessary to consider all higher-order interactions, and whether it is with little loss to replace them by lower-order or even pairwise interactions, remain a controversial issue. If the role of higher-order interactions is insignificant, the complexity of computation and the difficulty of analysis can be drastically reduced by projecting higher-order interactions into lower-order or pairwise interactions. We use link prediction, a fundamental problem in network science, as the entry point. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of higher-order interactions on link predictive accuracy to explore the necessity of these structures. We propose a method to decompose the higher-order structures in a stepwise way, thereby allowing to systematically explore the impacts of structures at different orders on link prediction. The results indicate that in some networks, incorporating higher-order interactions significantly enhances the accuracy of link prediction, while in others, the effect is insignificant. Therefore, we think that the role of higher-order interactions varies in different types of networks. Overall, since the improvement in predictive accuracy provided by higher-order interactions is significant in some networks, we believe that the study of higher-order interactions is both necessary and valuable.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Link Prediction: A Data Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Link prediction, a fundamental task on graphs, has proven indispensable in various applications, e.g., friend recommendation, protein analysis, and drug interaction prediction. However, since datasets span a multitude of domains, they could have distinct underlying mechanisms of link formation. Evidence in existing literature underscores the absence of a universally best algorithm suitable for all datasets. In this paper, we endeavor to explore principles of link prediction across diverse datasets from a data-centric perspective. We recognize three fundamental factors critical to link prediction: local structural proximity, global structural proximity, and feature proximity. We then unearth relationships among those factors where (i) global structural proximity only shows effectiveness when local structural proximity is deficient. (ii) The incompatibility can be found between feature and structural proximity. Such incompatibility leads to GNNs for Link Prediction (GNN4LP) consistently underperforming on edges where the feature proximity factor dominates. Inspired by these new insights from a data perspective, we offer practical instruction for GNN4LP model design and guidelines for selecting appropriate benchmark datasets for more comprehensive evaluations.</description>

      <title>Using Time-Aware Graph Neural Networks to Predict Temporal Centralities in Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Node centralities play a pivotal role in network science, social network analysis, and recommender systems. In temporal data, static path-based centralities like closeness or betweenness can give misleading results about the true importance of nodes in a temporal graph. To address this issue, temporal generalizations of betweenness and closeness have been defined that are based on the shortest time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. However, a major issue of those generalizations is that the calculation of such paths is computationally expensive. Addressing this issue, we study the application of De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNN), a time-aware graph neural network architecture, to predict temporal path-based centralities in time series data. We experimentally evaluate our approach in 13 temporal graphs from biological and social systems and show that it considerably improves the prediction of betweenness and closeness centrality compared to (i) a static Graph Convolutional Neural Network, (ii) an efficient sampling-based approximation technique for temporal betweenness, and (iii) two state-of-the-art time-aware graph learning techniques for dynamic graphs.</description>
