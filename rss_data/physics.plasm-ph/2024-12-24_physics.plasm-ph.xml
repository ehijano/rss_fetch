      <title>Development of grid-based and PINN solvers for electron kinetics in collisional non-thermal plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare traditional finite volume and Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) solvers for elliptic (Poisson), hyperbolic (advection), and parabolic (diffusion) equations in 2d settings. We describe the challenges of using traditional and PINN solvers for electron kinetic equations in collisional plasmas. The advantages and drawbacks of PINNs over state-of-the-art traditional solvers are discussed. We also consider angular moments in spherical velocity space and the potential use of ML algorithms for reduced kinetic models in the coordinate-energy phase space based on adaptive closure relations.</description>

      <title>Technical Status Report on Plasma Components and Systems in the context of EuPRAXIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EuPRAXIA project aims to construct two state-of-the-art accelerator facilities based on plasma accelerator technology. Plasma-based accelerators offer the possibility of a significant reduction in facility size and cost savings over current radio frequency (RF) accelerators. The two facilities - one laser-driven one a beam-driven - are envisioned to provide electron beams with an energy in the range of 1-5 GeV and beam quality comparable to existing RF machines. This will enable a versatile portfolio of applications from compact free-electron laser (FEL) drivers to sources for medical and industrial imaging.
  At the heart of both facilities is the use of plasma-based accelerator components and systems which encompass not only the accelerating medium itself, but also a range of auxiliary systems such as plasma-based electron beam optics and plasma-based mirrors for high-intensity lasers. From a technical standpoint, a high-degree of control over these plasma devices will be essential for EuPRAXIA to achieve its target performance goals. The ability to diagnose and characterize these plasma devices and to simulate their operation will be further essential success factors. Additionally, compatibility with extended operation at high-repetition rates and integration into the accelerator beamline will also prove crucial.
  In this work, we aim to review the current status of plasma components and related systems for both laser-driven and beam-driven plasma accelerators and to assess challenges to be addressed regarding implementation at future EuPRAXIA facilities.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity fluxes in dynamos from rotating inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze direct numerical simulations of large-scale dynamos in inhomogeneous nonhelically-driven rotating turbulence with and without shear. The forcing is modulated so that the turbulent intensity peaks in the middle of the computational box and drops to nearly zero at the two ends above and below the midplane. A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\alpha$ effect of opposite signs between the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the hemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important and can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the $\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously been observed in non-shearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic Reynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent dynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number -- just like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos, where the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it. This suggests that catastrophic dynamo quenching is alleviated by the shear-induced hemispheric small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes that can even overcompensate the fluxes between large and small scales and thereby cause resistive contributions.</description>

      <title>Wakefield generation and electron acceleration via propagation of radially polarized laser pulses in homogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a study of wakefield generation and electron injection via propagation of radially polarized laser pulses in homogeneous pre-ionized plasma. The analytical study is based on Lorentz force and continuity equations. Perturbation technique and quasi-static approximation are used for evaluating the generated longitudinal wakefields. Trapping and acceleration of electrons are examined by injecting a test electron in the generated wakefields. The results are compared with those obtained via linearly polarized laser pulses. The validation of analytical results is performed using the Fourier-Bessel particle-in-cell (FBPIC) simulation code. It is seen that there is a significant enhancement in amplitude of the longitudinal wakefield generated and electron energy gain via radially polarized laser pulses as compared to linearly polarized laser pulse case.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics and dissipation in the binary magnetosphere of pre-merger neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy release in the interacting magnetospheres of binary neutron stars (BNS) with global 3D force-free electrodynamics simulations. The system's behavior depends on the inclinations $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ of the stars' magnetic dipole moments relative to their orbital angular momentum. The simplest aligned configuration ($\chi_1=\chi_2=0^\circ$) has no magnetic field lines connecting the two stars. Remarkably, it still develops separatrix current sheets warping around each star and forms a dissipative region at the interface of the two magnetospheres. Dissipation at the interface is caused by a Kelvin-Helmholtz-type (KH) instability, which generates local Alfv\'enic turbulence and escaping fast magnetosonic waves. Binaries with inclined magnetospheres release energy in two ways: via KH instability at the interface and via magnetic reconnection flares in the twisted flux bundles connecting the two stars. The outgoing compressive waves can develop shocks and source fast radio bursts. We discuss implications for X-ray and radio precursors of BNS mergers.</description>

      <title>Ion-Scale Solitary Structures in the Solar Wind Observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of ion-scale magnetic solitary structures in the solar wind, characterized by distinct magnetic field enhancements and bipolar rotations over spatial scales of several proton inertial lengths. Previously tentatively identified as Alfv\'enic solitons, these structures are revisited using high-resolution data from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions. Using a machine learning-based method, we identified nearly a thousand such structures, providing new insights into their evolution and physical properties. Statistical analysis shows that these structures are more abundant closer to the Sun, with occurrence rates peaking around 30-40 solar radii and declining at greater distances, suggesting that they decay. High-cadence measurements reveal that these structures are predominantly found in low-beta environments, with consistent fluctuations in density, velocity, and magnetic field. Magnetic field enhancements are often accompanied by plasma density drops, which, under near pressure balance, limit field increases. This leads to small fractional field enhancements near the Sun (approximately 0.01 at 20 solar radii), making detection challenging. Magnetic field variance analysis indicates that these structures are primarily oblique to the local magnetic field. Alfv\'enic velocity-magnetic field correlations suggest that most of these structures propagate sunward in the plasma frame, distinguishing them from typical solar wind fluctuations. We compare these findings with previous studies, discussing possible generation mechanisms and their implications for the turbulent cascade in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind. Further high-resolution observations and simulations are needed to fully understand their origins and impacts.</description>

      <title>Fast-moving electrostatic solitons in a plasma with turbulence heating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, it is shown that electrostatic solitons in a plasma with turbulent heating of the electrons through an accelerating electric field can form with very high velocities, reaching up to several order of magnitudes larger than the equilibrium ion-sound speed. The possible parameter regime, where this work may be relevant, can be found in the so-called "dead zones" of a protoplanetary disk. Though these zones are stable to magnetorotational instability, the resultant turbulence can in fact heat the electrons making them follow a highly non- Maxwellian velocity distribution. We show that these fast-moving solitons can reach very high velocities. With electron velocity distribution described by the Davydov distribution function, we argue that these solitons can be an effective mechanism for energy equilibration in such a situation through soliton decay and radiation.</description>

      <title>Volkov solutions for relativistic magnetized plasma in strong field quantum electrodynamics regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study shows the dynamics of relativistic electrons in terms of Dirac equation solutions when an ultra-intense short laser pulse of intensity $\ge 10^{23} {W.cm^{-2}}$ propagates through magnetized dense plasma ($B_0\approx {1MG})$. The interaction dynamics is analyzed near the strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED) regime. Our study finds new solutions in plasma media considering the effects of the re-normalized mass of relativistic electrons and the nonzero effective mass of accelerated photons. We have provided a general method for constructing exact solutions of the Dirac relativistic equation that correctly explains the dynamics of electrons in the strongly magnetized plasma medium. The modified solutions of the Dirac equation for one electron are derived and compared to the Volkov solutions. The new solutions are a basis for a feasible explanation of quantum attributes of relativistic electrons in a strong electromagnetic field of very short ultra-intense laser pulses with intensity near Schwinger field intensity. The solutions are called new Volkov solutions in a plasma medium. These solutions can be used to understand better the theory of quantum radiation reaction for the next-generation laser-plasma accelerator. Our results show that the Volkov solutions are not applicable in a magnetized plasma medium</description>

      <title>Turbulent multicomponent magnetopause: Analytical description and kinetic simulation of complex distributed current sheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out particle-in-cell simulations of complex current sheets of the family of analytically found Vlasov--Maxwell equilibria that model a collisionless magnetopause and allow for arbitrary energy distributions and countercurrents of various particle component. We find that, depending on the parameters, i)~a weak small-scale bending-type instability is always present at the sharp low-density plasma boundary of such a magnetopause, and ii)~the development of a small-scale Weibel-type instability inside a magnetopause is either excluded or possible. Both cases are studied and compared for two variants of the particle energy distribution~ -- Maxwellian and Kappa. The long-term stability of the whole current sheet is observed either without or with saturated Weibel-type turbulence, which can be generated in a low-magnetized region between neighboring countercurrents. We point out the applicability of the developed model of distributed current sheets and the results of analysis of their small-scale instability for the description of physical phenomena in the magnetopauses of planets and late-type stars.</description>

      <title>Laser wakefield acceleration of ions with a transverse flying focus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extreme electric fields created in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions could generate energetic ions far more compactly than traditional accelerators. Despite this promise, laser-plasma accelerators have remained stagnant at maximum ion energies of 100 MeV/nucleon for the last twenty years. The central challenge is the low charge-to-mass ratio of ions, which has precluded one of the most successful approaches used for electrons: laser wakefield acceleration. Here we show that a laser pulse with a focal spot that moves transverse to the laser propagation direction enables wakefield acceleration of ions to GeV energies in underdense plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this relativistic-intensity "transverse flying focus" can trap ions in a comoving electrostatic pocket, producing a monoenergetic collimated ion beam. With a peak intensity of $10^{20}\,$W/cm$^2$ and an acceleration distance of $0.44\,$cm, we observe a proton beam with $23.1\,$pC charge, $1.6\,$GeV peak energy, and $3.7\,$% relative energy spread. This approach allows for compact high-repetition-rate production of high-energy ions, highlighting the capability of more generalized spatio-temporal pulse shaping to address open problems in plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of The Brightest Nano-size Gamma Source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma rays selectively interact with nuclei, induce and mediate nuclear reactions and elementary particle interactions, and exceed x-rays in penetrating power and thus are indispensable for analysis and modification of dense objects. Yet, the available gamma sources lack sufficient power and brightness. The predicted and highly desirable laser-driven gamma flash, from here on termed "Gamma Flash", based on inverse Compton scattering from solid targets at extreme irradiances (&gt;$10^{23}W/cm^2$), would be the highest-power and the brightest terrestrial gamma source with a 30-40% laser-to-gamma energy conversion. However, Gamma Flash remains inaccessible experimentally due to the Bremsstrahlung background. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new interaction regime at the highest effective irradiance where Gamma Flash scaled quickly with the laser power and produced several times the number of Bremsstrahlung photons. Simulations revealed an attosecond, Terawatt Gamma Flash with a nanometre source size achieving a record brightness exceeding $~10^{23}photons/mm^2mrad^2s$ per 0.1% bandwidth at tens of MeV photon energies, surpassing astrophysical Gamma Ray Bursts. These findings could revolutionize inertial fusion energy by enabling unprecedented sub-micrometre/femtosecond resolution radiography of fuel mixing instabilities in extremely-compressed targets. The new gamma source could facilitate significant advances in time-resolved nuclear physics, homeland security, nuclear waste management and non-proliferation, while opening possibilities for spatially-coherent gamma rays.</description>

Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>
