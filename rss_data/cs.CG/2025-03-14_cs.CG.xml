      <title>Cover Learning for Large-Scale Topology Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical unsupervised learning methods like clustering and linear dimensionality reduction parametrize large-scale geometry when it is discrete or linear, while more modern methods from manifold learning find low dimensional representation or infer local geometry by constructing a graph on the input data. More recently, topological data analysis popularized the use of simplicial complexes to represent data topology with two main methodologies: topological inference with geometric complexes and large-scale topology visualization with Mapper graphs -- central to these is the nerve construction from topology, which builds a simplicial complex given a cover of a space by subsets. While successful, these have limitations: geometric complexes scale poorly with data size, and Mapper graphs can be hard to tune and only contain low dimensional information. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of learning covers in its own right, and from the perspective of optimization. We describe a method for learning topologically-faithful covers of geometric datasets, and show that the simplicial complexes thus obtained can outperform standard topological inference approaches in terms of size, and Mapper-type algorithms in terms of representation of large-scale topology.</description>

      <title>Drums of high width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a family of $5$-dimensional prismatoids whose width grows linearly in the number of vertices. This provides a new infinite family of counter-examples to the Hirsch conjecture whose excess width grows linearly in the number of vertices, and answers a question of Matschke, Santos and Weibel.</description>

      <title>Separating Geometric Data with Minimum Cost: Two Disjoint Convex Hulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.09974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a geometric version of an NP-hard problem ("Almost $2-SAT$" problem) is introduced which has potential applications in clustering, separation axis, binary sensor networks, shape separation, image processing, etc. Furthermore, it has been illustrated that the new problem known as "Two Disjoint Convex Hulls" can be solved in polynomial time due to some combinatorial aspects and geometric properties. For this purpose, an $O(n^2)$ algorithm has also been presented which employs the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) and the duality of points/lines.</description>

      <title>A new metaheuristic approach for the art gallery problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.05540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the problem "Localization and trilateration with the minimum number of landmarks", we faced the 3-Guard and classic Art Gallery Problems. The goal of the art gallery problem is to find the minimum number of guards within a simple polygon to observe and protect its entirety. It has many applications in robotics, telecommunications, etc. There are some approaches to handle the art gallery problem that is theoretically NP-hard. This paper offers an efficient method based on the Particle Filter algorithm which solves the most fundamental state of the problem in a nearly optimal manner. The experimental results on the random polygons generated by Bottino et al. \cite{bottino2011nearly} show that the new method is more accurate with fewer or equal guards. Furthermore, we discuss resampling and particle numbers to minimize the run time.</description>

      <title>Tiling Rectangles and the Plane using Squares of Integral Sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of perfect tiling in the plane and exploring the possibility of tiling a rectangle using integral distinct squares. Assume a set of distinguishable squares (or equivalently a set of distinct natural numbers) is given, and one has to decide whether it can tile the plane or a rectangle or not. Previously, it has been proved that tiling the plane is not feasible using a set of odd numbers or an infinite sequence of natural numbers including exactly two odd numbers. The problem is open for different situations in which the number of odd numbers is arbitrary. In addition to providing a solution to this special case, we discuss some open problems to tile the plane and rectangles in this paper.</description>
