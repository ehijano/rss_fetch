      <title>Z-Merge: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for On-Ramp Merging with Zone-Specific V2X Traffic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramp merging is a critical and challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Existing approaches typically rely on either lane-changing or inter-vehicle gap creation strategies based solely on local or neighboring information, often leading to suboptimal performance in terms of safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, we present a V2X (vehicle-to-everything communication)-assisted Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for on-ramp merging that effectively coordinates the complex interplay between lane-changing and inter-vehicle gap adaptation strategies by utilizing zone-specific global information available from a roadside unit (RSU). The merging control problem is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MA-POMDP), where agents leverage both local and global observations through V2X communication. To support both discrete and continuous control decisions, we design a hybrid action space and adopt a parameterized deep Q-learning approach. Extensive simulations, integrating the SUMO traffic simulator and the MOSAIC V2X simulator, demonstrate that our framework significantly improves merging success rate, traffic efficiency, and road safety across diverse traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>A visual study of ICP variants for Lidar Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odometry with lidar sensors is a state-of-the-art method to estimate the ego pose of a moving vehicle. Many implementations of lidar odometry use variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Real-world effects such as dynamic objects, non-overlapping areas, and sensor noise diminish the accuracy of ICP. We build on a recently proposed method that makes these effects visible by visualizing the multidimensional objective function of ICP in two dimensions. We use this method to study different ICP variants in the context of lidar odometry. In addition, we propose a novel method to filter out dynamic objects and to address the ego blind spot problem.</description>

      <title>SVBRD-LLM: Self-Verifying Behavioral Rule Discovery for Autonomous Vehicle Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As more autonomous vehicles operate on public roads, understanding real-world behavior of autonomous vehicles is critical to analyzing traffic safety, making policies, and public acceptance. This paper proposes SVBRD-LLM, a framework that automatically discovers, verifies, and applies interpretable behavioral rules from real traffic videos through zero-shot prompt engineering. The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence.</description>

      <title>An Alignment-Based Approach to Learning Motions from Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has shown to provide robots with fundamental motion skills for a variety of domains. Various branches of LfD research (e.g., learned dynamical systems and movement primitives) can generally be classified into ''time-dependent'' or ''time-independent'' systems. Each provides fundamental benefits and drawbacks -- time-independent methods cannot learn overlapping trajectories, while time-dependence can result in undesirable behavior under perturbation. This paper introduces Cluster Alignment for Learned Motions (CALM), an LfD framework dependent upon an alignment with a representative ''mean" trajectory of demonstrated motions rather than pure time- or state-dependence. We discuss the convergence properties of CALM, introduce an alignment technique able to handle the shifts in alignment possible under perturbation, and utilize demonstration clustering to generate multi-modal behavior. We show how CALM mitigates the drawbacks of time-dependent and time-independent techniques on 2D datasets and implement our system on a 7-DoF robot learning tasks in three domains.</description>

      <title>Communication-Aware Asynchronous Distributed Trajectory Optimization for UAV Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optimization offers a promising paradigm for trajectory planning in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms, yet its deployment in communication-constrained environments remains challenging due to unreliable links and limited data exchange. This paper addresses this issue via a two-tier architecture explicitly designed for operation under communication constraints. We develop a Communication-Aware Asynchronous Distributed Trajectory Optimization (CA-ADTO) framework that integrates Parameterized Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP) for local trajectory optimization of individual UAVs with an asynchronous Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (async-ADMM) for swarm-level coordination. The proposed architecture enables fully distributed optimization while substantially reducing communication overhead, making it suitable for real-world scenarios in which reliable connectivity cannot be guaranteed. The method is particularly effective in handling nonlinear dynamics and spatio-temporal coupling under communication constraints.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Control Architectures for UAVs: a Comparison of SE2(3)-Based Approaches in Simulation and Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the integration and experimental validation of advanced control strategies for quadcopters based on Lie groups. We build upon recent theoretical developments on SE2(3)-based controllers and introduce a novel SE2(3) model predictive controller (MPC) that combines the predictive capabilities and constraint-handling of optimal control with the geometric properties of Lie group formulations. We evaluated this MPC against a state-of-the-art SE2(3)-based LQR approach and obtained comparable performance in simulation. Both controllers where also deployed on the Quanser QDrone platform and compared to each other and an industry standard control architecture. Results show that the SE_2(3) MPC achieves superior trajectory tracking performance and robustness across a range of scenarios. This work demonstrates the practical effectiveness of Lie group-based controllers and offers comparative insights into their impact on system behaviour and real-time performance</description>

      <title>Painted Heart Beats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present AURA, a framework for synergistic human-artist painting. We developed a robot arm that collaboratively paints with a human artist. The robot has an awareness of the artist's heartbeat through the EmotiBit sensor, which provides the arousal levels of the painter. Given the heartbeat detected, the robot decides to increase proximity to the artist's workspace or retract. If a higher heartbeat is detected, which is associated with increased arousal in human artists, the robot will move away from that area of the canvas. If the artist's heart rate is detected as neutral, indicating the human artist's baseline state, the robot will continue its painting actions across the entire canvas. We also demonstrate and propose alternative robot-artist interactions using natural language and physical touch. This work combines the biometrics of a human artist to inform fluent artistic interactions.</description>

      <title>Eq.Bot: Enhance Robotic Manipulation Learning via Group Equivariant Canonicalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems are increasingly deployed across diverse domains. Yet existing multi-modal learning frameworks lack inherent guarantees of geometric consistency, struggling to handle spatial transformations such as rotations and translations. While recent works attempt to introduce equivariance through bespoke architectural modifications, these methods suffer from high implementation complexity, computational cost, and poor portability. Inspired by human cognitive processes in spatial reasoning, we propose Eq.Bot, a universal canonicalization framework grounded in SE(2) group equivariant theory for robotic manipulation learning. Our framework transforms observations into a canonical space, applies an existing policy, and maps the resulting actions back to the original space. As a model-agnostic solution, Eq.Bot aims to endow models with spatial equivariance without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Eq.Bot under both CNN-based (e.g., CLIPort) and Transformer-based (e.g., OpenVLA-OFT) architectures over existing methods on various robotic manipulation tasks, where the most significant improvement can reach 50.0%.</description>

      <title>VIRAL: Visual Sim-to-Real at Scale for Humanoid Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key barrier to the real-world deployment of humanoid robots is the lack of autonomous loco-manipulation skills. We introduce VIRAL, a visual sim-to-real framework that learns humanoid loco-manipulation entirely in simulation and deploys it zero-shot to real hardware. VIRAL follows a teacher-student design: a privileged RL teacher, operating on full state, learns long-horizon loco-manipulation using a delta action space and reference state initialization. A vision-based student policy is then distilled from the teacher via large-scale simulation with tiled rendering, trained with a mixture of online DAgger and behavior cloning. We find that compute scale is critical: scaling simulation to tens of GPUs (up to 64) makes both teacher and student training reliable, while low-compute regimes often fail. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, VIRAL combines large-scale visual domain randomization over lighting, materials, camera parameters, image quality, and sensor delays--with real-to-sim alignment of the dexterous hands and cameras. Deployed on a Unitree G1 humanoid, the resulting RGB-based policy performs continuous loco-manipulation for up to 54 cycles, generalizing to diverse spatial and appearance variations without any real-world fine-tuning, and approaching expert-level teleoperation performance. Extensive ablations dissect the key design choices required to make RGB-based humanoid loco-manipulation work in practice.</description>

      <title>A Class of Dual-Frame Passively-Tilting Fully-Actuated Hexacopter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposed a novel fully-actuated hexacopter. It features a dual-frame passive tilting structure and achieves independent control of translational motion and attitude with minimal actuators. Compared to previous fully-actuated UAVs, it liminates internal force cancellation, resulting in higher flight efficiency and endurance under equivalent payload conditions. Based on the dynamic model of fully-actuated hexacopter, a full-actuation controller is designed to achieve efficient and stable control. Finally, simulation is conducted, validating the superior fully-actuated motion capability of fully-actuated hexacopter and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Model-Checking a ROS2 Multi-Robot System using Timed Rebeca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based development enables quicker prototyping, earlier experimentation and validation of design intents. For a multi-agent system with complex asynchronous interactions and concurrency, formal verification, model-checking in particular, offers an automated mechanism for verifying desired properties. Timed Rebeca is an actor-based modelling language supporting reactive, concurrent and time semantics, accompanied with a model-checking compiler. These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors. The biggest challenges in modelling and verifying a multi-robot system lie in abstracting complex information, bridging the gap between a discrete model and a continuous system and compacting the state space, while maintaining the model's accuracy. We develop different discretization strategies for different kinds of information, identifying the 'enough' thresholds of abstraction, and applying efficient optimization techniques to boost computations. With this work we demonstrate how to use models to design and verify a multi-robot system, how to discretely model a continuous system to do model-checking efficiently, and the round-trip engineering flow between the model and the implementation. The released Rebeca and ROS2 codes can serve as a foundation for modelling multiple autonomous robots systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Breaking in Multi-Agent Navigation: Winding Number-Aware MPC with a Learned Topological Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the fundamental challenge of resolving symmetry-induced deadlocks in distributed multi-agent navigation by proposing a new hierarchical navigation method. When multiple agents interact, it is inherently difficult for them to autonomously break the symmetry of deciding how to pass each other. To tackle this problem, we introduce an approach that quantifies cooperative symmetry-breaking strategies using a topological invariant called the winding number, and learns the strategies themselves through reinforcement learning. Our method features a hierarchical policy consisting of a learning-based Planner, which plans topological cooperative strategies, and a model-based Controller, which executes them. Through reinforcement learning, the Planner learns to produce two types of parameters for the Controller: one is the topological cooperative strategy represented by winding numbers, and the other is a set of dynamic weights that determine which agent interaction to prioritize in dense scenarios where multiple agents cross simultaneously. The Controller then generates collision-free and efficient motions based on the strategy and weights provided by the Planner. This hierarchical structure combines the flexible decision-making ability of learning-based methods with the reliability of model-based approaches. Simulation and real-world robot experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, particularly in dense environments, by efficiently avoiding collisions and deadlocks while achieving superior navigation performance. The code for the experiments is available at https://github.com/omron-sinicx/WNumMPC.</description>

      <title>Behavior Trees vs Executable Ontologies: a Comparative Analysis of Robot Control Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares two distinct approaches to modeling robotic behavior: imperative Behavior Trees (BTs) and declarative Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework. BTs structure behavior hierarchically using control-flow, whereas EO represents the domain as a temporal, event-based semantic graph driven by dataflow rules. We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control. EO supports runtime model modification, full temporal traceability, and a unified representation of data, logic, and interface - features that are difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve with BTs, although BTs excel in established, predictable scenarios. The comparison is grounded in a practical mobile manipulation task. This comparison highlights the respective operational strengths of each approach in dynamic, evolving robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Look, Zoom, Understand: The Robotic Eyeball for Embodied Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In embodied AI perception systems, visual perception should be active: the goal is not to passively process static images, but to actively acquire more informative data within pixel and spatial budget constraints. Existing vision models and fixed RGB-D camera systems fundamentally fail to reconcile wide-area coverage with fine-grained detail acquisition, severely limiting their efficacy in open-world robotic applications. To address this issue, we propose EyeVLA, a robotic eyeball for active visual perception that can take proactive actions based on instructions, enabling clear observation of fine-grained target objects and detailed information across a wide spatial extent. EyeVLA discretizes action behaviors into action tokens and integrates them with vision-language models (VLMs) that possess strong open-world understanding capabilities, enabling joint modeling of vision, language, and actions within a single autoregressive sequence. By using the 2D bounding box coordinates to guide the reasoning chain and applying reinforcement learning to refine the viewpoint selection policy, we transfer the open-world scene understanding capability of the VLM to a vision language action (VLA) policy using only minimal real-world data. Experiments show that our system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions of rotation and zoom, thereby achieving strong environmental perception capabilities. EyeVLA introduces a novel robotic vision system that leverages detailed and spatially rich, large-scale embodied data, and actively acquires highly informative visual observations for downstream embodied tasks.</description>

      <title>Path Planning through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments is a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation and robotics, where obstacles and conditions change over time, introducing uncertainty and requiring continuous adaptation. While existing approaches often assume complete environmental unpredictability or rely on global planners, these assumptions limit scalability and practical deployment in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable, region-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework for path planning in dynamic environments. Our method builds on the observation that environmental changes, although dynamic, are often localized within bounded regions. To exploit this, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and deploy distributed RL agents that adapt to changes locally. We further propose a retraining mechanism based on sub-environment success rates to determine when policy updates are necessary. Two training paradigms are explored: single-agent Q-learning and multi-agent federated Q-learning, where local Q-tables are aggregated periodically to accelerate the learning process. Unlike prior work, we evaluate our methods in more realistic settings, where multiple simultaneous obstacle changes and increasing difficulty levels are present. Results show that the federated variants consistently outperform their single-agent counterparts and closely approach the performance of A* Oracle while maintaining shorter adaptation times and robust scalability. Although initial training remains time-consuming in large environments, our decentralized framework eliminates the need for a global planner and lays the groundwork for future improvements using deep RL and flexible environment decomposition.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Robot Positioning Against Placement Inaccuracies: A Study on the Fanuc CRX10iA/L</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a methodology for determining the optimal base placement of a Fanuc CRX10iA/L collaborative robot for a desired trajectory corresponding to an industrial task. The proposed method uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm that explores the search space to find positions for performing the trajectory. An $\alpha$-shape algorithm is then used to draw the borders of the feasibility areas, and the largest circle inscribed is calculated from the Voronoi diagrams. The aim of this approach is to provide a robustness criterion in the context of robot placement inaccuracies that may be encountered, for example, if the robot is placed on a mobile base when the system is deployed by an operator. The approach developed uses an inverse kinematics model to evaluate all initial configurations, then moves the robot end-effector along the reference trajectory using the Jacobian matrix and assigns a score to the attempt. For the Fanuc CRX10iA/L robot, there can be up to 16 solutions to the inverse kinematics model. The calculation of these solutions is not trivial and requires a specific study that planning tools such as MoveIt cannot fully take into account. Additionally, the optimization process must consider constraints such as joint limits, singularities, and workspace limitations to ensure feasible and efficient trajectory execution.</description>

      <title>MSA - Technique for Stiffness Modeling of Manipulators with Complex and Hybrid Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a systematic approach for stiffness modeling of manipulators with complex and hybrid structures using matrix structural analysis. In contrast to previous results, it is suitable for mixed architectures containing closed-loops, flexible links, rigid connections, passive and elastic joints with external loadings and preloadings. The proposed approach produces the Cartesian stiffness matrices in a semi-analytical manner. It presents the manipulator stiffness model as a set of conventional equations describing the link elasticities that are supplemented by a set of constraints describing connections between links. Its allows user straightforward aggregation of stiffness model equations avoiding traditional column/row merging procedures in the extended stiffness matrix. Advantages of this approach are illustrated by stiffness analysis of NaVaRo manipulator.</description>

      <title>C2F-Space: Coarse-to-Fine Space Grounding for Spatial Instructions using Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space grounding refers to localizing a set of spatial references described in natural language instructions. Traditional methods often fail to account for complex reasoning -- such as distance, geometry, and inter-object relationships -- while vision-language models (VLMs), despite strong reasoning abilities, struggle to produce a fine-grained region of outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose C2F-Space, a novel coarse-to-fine space-grounding framework that (i) estimates an approximated yet spatially consistent region using a VLM, then (ii) refines the region to align with the local environment through superpixelization. For the coarse estimation, we design a grid-based visual-grounding prompt with a propose-validate strategy, maximizing VLM's spatial understanding and yielding physically and semantically valid canonical region (i.e., ellipses). For the refinement, we locally adapt the region to surrounding environment without over-relaxed to free space. We construct a new space-grounding benchmark and compare C2F-Space with five state-of-the-art baselines using success rate and intersection-over-union. Our C2F-Space significantly outperforms all baselines. Our ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each module in the two-step process and their synergistic effect of the combined framework. We finally demonstrate the applicability of C2F-Space to simulated robotic pick-and-place tasks.</description>

      <title>Platform-Agnostic Reinforcement Learning Framework for Safe Exploration of Cluttered Environments with Graph Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration of obstacle-rich spaces requires strategies that ensure efficiency while guaranteeing safety against collisions with obstacles. This paper investigates a novel platform-agnostic reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network-based policy for next-waypoint selection, with a safety filter ensuring safe mobility. Specifically, the neural network is trained using reinforcement learning through the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to maximize exploration efficiency while minimizing safety filter interventions. Henceforth, when the policy proposes an infeasible action, the safety filter overrides it with the closest feasible alternative, ensuring consistent system behavior. In addition, this paper introduces a reward function shaped by a potential field that accounts for both the agent's proximity to unexplored regions and the expected information gain from reaching them. The proposed framework combines the adaptability of reinforcement learning-based exploration policies with the reliability provided by explicit safety mechanisms. This feature plays a key role in enabling the deployment of learning-based policies on robotic platforms operating in real-world environments. Extensive evaluations in both simulations and experiments performed in a lab environment demonstrate that the approach achieves efficient and safe exploration in cluttered spaces.</description>

      <title>RRT*former: Environment-Aware Sampling-Based Motion Planning using Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sampling-based optimal path planning problem for robotics in complex and dynamic environments. Most existing sampling-based algorithms neglect environmental information or the information from previous samples. Yet, these pieces of information are highly informative, as leveraging them can provide better heuristics when sampling the next state. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling-based planning algorithm, called \emph{RRT*former}, which integrates the standard RRT* algorithm with a Transformer network in a novel way. Specifically, the Transformer is used to extract features from the environment and leverage information from previous samples to better guide the sampling process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing sampling-based approaches such as RRT*, Neural RRT*, and their variants, our algorithm achieves considerable improvements in both the optimality of the path and sampling efficiency. The code for our implementation is available on https://github.com/fengmingyang666/RRTformer.</description>

      <title>Discovering Optimal Natural Gaits of Dissipative Systems via Virtual Energy Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged robots offer several advantages when navigating unstructured environments, but they often fall short of the efficiency achieved by wheeled robots. One promising strategy to improve their energy economy is to leverage their natural (unactuated) dynamics using elastic elements. This work explores that concept by designing energy-optimal control inputs through a unified, multi-stage framework. It starts with a novel energy injection technique to identify passive motion patterns by harnessing the system's natural dynamics. This enables the discovery of passive solutions even in systems with energy dissipation caused by factors such as friction or plastic collisions. Building on these passive solutions, we then employ a continuation approach to derive energy-optimal control inputs for the fully actuated, dissipative robotic system. The method is tested on simulated models to demonstrate its applicability in both single- and multi-legged robotic systems. This analysis provides valuable insights into the design and operation of elastic legged robots, offering pathways to improve their efficiency and adaptability by exploiting the natural system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Closed-loop Stability Bounds for Dynamical System Coupled with Diffusion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Policy has shown great performance in robotic manipulation tasks under stochastic perturbations, due to its ability to model multimodal action distributions. Nonetheless, its reliance on a computationally expensive reverse-time diffusion (denoising) process, for action inference, makes it challenging to use for real-time applications where quick decision-making is mandatory. This work studies the possibility of conducting the denoising process only partially before executing an action, allowing the plant to evolve according to its dynamics in parallel to the reverse-time diffusion dynamics ongoing on the computer. In a classical diffusion policy setting, the plant dynamics are usually slow and the two dynamical processes are uncoupled. Here, we investigate theoretical bounds on the stability of closed-loop systems using diffusion policies when the plant dynamics and the denoising dynamics are coupled. The contribution of this work gives a framework for faster imitation learning and a metric that yields if a controller will be stable based on the variance of the demonstrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teams of cooperating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) rely on acoustic communication for coordination, yet this communication medium is constrained by limited range, multi-path effects, and low bandwidth. One way to address the uncertainty associated with acoustic communication is to learn the communication environment in real-time. We address the challenge of a team of robots building a map of the probability of communication success from one location to another in real-time. This is a decentralized classification problem -- communication events are either successful or unsuccessful -- where AUVs share a subset of their communication measurements to build the map. The main contribution of this work is a rigorously derived data sharing policy that selects measurements to be shared among AUVs. We experimentally validate our proposed sharing policy using real acoustic communication data collected from teams of Virginia Tech 690 AUVs, demonstrating its effectiveness in underwater environments.</description>

      <title>NMPC-based Motion Planning with Adaptive Weighting for Dynamic Object Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catching fast-moving objects serves as a benchmark for robotic agility, posing significant coordination challenges for cooperative manipulator systems holding a catcher, particularly due to inherent closed-chain constraints. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner that bridges high-level interception planning with real-time joint space control, enabling dynamic object interception for systems comprising two cooperating arms. We introduce an Adaptive- Terminal (AT) MPC formulation featuring cost shaping, which contrasts with a simpler Primitive-Terminal (PT) approach relying heavily on terminal penalties for rapid convergence. The proposed AT formulation is shown to effectively mitigate issues related to actuator power limit violations frequently encountered with the PT strategy, yielding trajectories and significantly reduced control effort. Experimental results on a robotic platform with two cooperative arms, demonstrating excellent real time performance, with an average planner cycle computation time of approximately 19 ms-less than half the 40 ms system sampling time. These results indicate that the AT formulation achieves significantly improved motion quality and robustness with minimal computational overhead compared to the PT baseline, making it well-suited for dynamic, cooperative interception tasks.</description>

      <title>UltraDP: Generalizable Carotid Ultrasound Scanning with Force-Aware Diffusion Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15550v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound scanning is a critical imaging technique for real-time, non-invasive diagnostics. However, variations in patient anatomy and complex human-in-the-loop interactions pose significant challenges for autonomous robotic scanning. Existing ultrasound scanning robots are commonly limited to relatively low generalization and inefficient data utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present UltraDP, a Diffusion-Policy-based method that receives multi-sensory inputs (ultrasound images, wrist camera images, contact wrench, and probe pose) and generates actions that are fit for multi-modal action distributions in autonomous ultrasound scanning of carotid artery. We propose a specialized guidance module to enable the policy to output actions that center the artery in ultrasound images. To ensure stable contact and safe interaction between the robot and the human subject, a hybrid force-impedance controller is utilized to drive the robot to track such trajectories. Also, we have built a large-scale training dataset for carotid scanning comprising 210 scans with 460k sample pairs from 21 volunteers of both genders. By exploring our guidance module and DP's strong generalization ability, UltraDP achieves a 95% success rate in transverse scanning on previously unseen subjects, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>SRPO: Self-Referential Policy Optimization for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore, SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the LIBERO-Plus benchmark.</description>

      <title>Optimus-Q: Utilizing Federated Learning in Adaptive Robots for Intelligent Nuclear Power Plant Operations through Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of advanced robotics in nuclear power plants (NPPs) presents a transformative opportunity to enhance safety, efficiency, and environmental monitoring in high-stakes environments. Our paper introduces the Optimus-Q robot, a sophisticated system designed to autonomously monitor air quality and detect contamination while leveraging adaptive learning techniques and secure quantum communication. Equipped with advanced infrared sensors, the Optimus-Q robot continuously streams real-time environmental data to predict hazardous gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH$_4$). Utilizing a federated learning approach, the robot collaborates with other systems across various NPPs to improve its predictive capabilities without compromising data privacy. Additionally, the implementation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) ensures secure data transmission, safeguarding sensitive operational information. Our methodology combines systematic navigation patterns with machine learning algorithms to facilitate efficient coverage of designated areas, thereby optimizing contamination monitoring processes. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Optimus-Q robot in enhancing operational safety and responsiveness in nuclear facilities. This research underscores the potential of integrating robotics, machine learning, and quantum technologies to revolutionize monitoring systems in hazardous environments.</description>

      <title>Real-time Point Cloud Data Transmission via L4S for 5G-Edge-Assisted Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel framework for real-time Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data transmission that leverages rate-adaptive technologies and point cloud encoding methods to ensure low-latency, and low-loss data streaming. The proposed framework is intended for, but not limited to, robotic applications that require real-time data transmission over the internet for offloaded processing. Specifically, the Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput L4S-enabled SCReAM v2 transmission framework is extended to incorporate the Draco geometry compression algorithm, enabling dynamic compression of high-bitrate 3D LiDAR data according to the sensed channel capacity and network load. The low-latency 3D LiDAR streaming system is designed to maintain minimal end-to-end delay while constraining encoding errors to meet the accuracy requirements of robotic applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through real-world experiments conducted over a public 5G network across multi-kilometer urban environments. The low-latency and low-loss requirements are preserved, while real-time offloading and evaluation of 3D SLAM algorithms are used to validate the framework's performance in practical use cases.</description>

      <title>In-N-On: Scaling Egocentric Manipulation with in-the-wild and on-task Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Egocentric videos are a valuable and scalable data source to learn manipulation policies. However, due to significant data heterogeneity, most existing approaches utilize human data for simple pre-training, which does not unlock its full potential. This paper first provides a scalable recipe for collecting and using egocentric data by categorizing human data into two categories: in-the-wild and on-task alongside with systematic analysis on how to use the data. We first curate a dataset, PHSD, which contains over 1,000 hours of diverse in-the-wild egocentric data and over 20 hours of on-task data directly aligned to the target manipulation tasks. This enables learning a large egocentric language-conditioned flow matching policy, Human0. With domain adaptation techniques, Human0 minimizes the gap between humans and humanoids. Empirically, we show Human0 achieves several novel properties from scaling human data, including language following of instructions from only human data, few-shot learning, and improved robustness using on-task data.

      <title>Attacking Autonomous Driving Agents with Adversarial Machine Learning: A Holistic Evaluation with the CARLA Leaderboard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To autonomously control vehicles, driving agents use outputs from a combination of machine-learning (ML) models, controller logic, and custom modules. Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.
  To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.
  We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence approaches for energy-efficient laser cutting machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research addresses the significant challenges of energy consumption and environmental impact in laser cutting by proposing novel deep learning (DL) methodologies to achieve energy reduction. Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.</description>

      <title>EGSA-PT:Edge-Guided Spatial Attention with Progressive Training for Monocular Depth Estimation and Segmentation of Transparent Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparent object perception remains a major challenge in computer vision research, as transparency confounds both depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Recent work has explored multi-task learning frameworks to improve robustness, yet negative cross-task interactions often hinder performance. In this work, we introduce Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA), a fusion mechanism designed to mitigate destructive interactions by incorporating boundary information into the fusion between semantic and geometric features. On both Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, EGSA consistently improved depth accuracy over the current state of the art method (MODEST), while preserving competitive segmentation performance, with the largest improvements appearing in transparent regions. Besides our fusion design, our second contribution is a multi-modal progressive training strategy, where learning transitions from edges derived from RGB images to edges derived from predicted depth images. This approach allows the system to bootstrap learning from the rich textures contained in RGB images, and then switch to more relevant geometric content in depth maps, while it eliminates the need for ground-truth depth at training time. Together, these contributions highlight edge-guided fusion as a robust approach capable of improving transparent object perception.</description>

      <title>Learning Human-Like RL Agents Through Trajectory Optimization With Action Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-like agents have long been one of the goals in pursuing artificial intelligence. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents. Our code is available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/MAQ.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</description>

      <title>Fast Post-Hoc Confidence Fusion for 3-Class Open-Set Aerial Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing reliable UAV navigation systems requires robust air-to-air object detectors capable of distinguishing between objects seen during training and previously unseen objects. While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments confirm that our method surpasses threshold-based baselines in two-class classification by an average of 2.7% AUROC, while retaining or improving open-set mAP. Furthermore, our study uniquely enables robust three-class classification, a critical capability for safe UAV navigation, where OOD objects must be actively avoided and background regions safely ignored. Comparative analysis highlights that our method surpasses competitive techniques in AUROC across datasets, while improving closed-set mAP by up to 9 points, an 18% relative gain.</description>

      <title>PCARNN-DCBF: Minimal-Intervention Geofence Enforcement for Ground Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Runtime geofencing for ground vehicles is rapidly emerging as a critical technology for enforcing Operational Design Domains (ODDs). However, existing solutions struggle to reconcile high-fidelity learning with the structural requirements of verifiable control. We address this by introducing PCARNN-DCBF, a novel pipeline integrating a Physics-encoded Control-Affine Residual Neural Network with a preview-based Discrete Control Barrier Function. Unlike generic learned models, PCARNN explicitly preserves the control-affine structure of vehicle dynamics, ensuring the linearity required for reliable optimization. This enables the DCBF to enforce polygonal keep-in constraints via a real-time Quadratic Program (QP) that handles high relative degree and mitigates actuator saturation. Experiments in CARLA across electric and combustion platforms demonstrate that this structure-preserving approach significantly outperforms analytical and unstructured neural baselines.</description>

      <title>MambaIO: Global-Coordinate Inertial Odometry for Pedestrians via Multi-Scale Frequency-Decoupled Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial Odometry (IO) enables real-time localization using only acceleration and angular velocity measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), making it a promising solution for localization in consumer-grade applications. Traditionally, IMU measurements in IO have been processed under two coordinate system paradigms: the body coordinate frame and the global coordinate frame, with the latter being widely adopted. However, recent studies in drone scenarios have demonstrated that the body frame can significantly improve localization accuracy, prompting a re-evaluation of the suitability of the global frame for pedestrian IO. To address this issue, this paper systematically evaluates the effectiveness of the global coordinate frame in pedestrian IO through theoretical analysis, qualitative inspection, and quantitative experiments. Building upon these findings, we further propose MambaIO, which decomposes IMU measurements into high-frequency and low-frequency components using a Laplacian pyramid. The low-frequency component is processed by a Mamba architecture to extract implicit contextual motion cues, while the high-frequency component is handled by a convolutional structure to capture fine-grained local motion details. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that MambaIO substantially reduces localization error and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the Mamba architecture to the inertial odometry task.</description>

      <title>DeepThinkVLA: Enhancing Reasoning Capability of Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to "think before acting" via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a promising path to overcoming the data-hungry nature of end-to-end robot policies. However, progress is stalled by a fundamental conflict: existing models use a single autoregressive decoder for both sequential CoT reasoning and high-dimensional, parallelizable robot actions. This architectural mismatch degrades motor control and fails to forge a strong causal link between thought and action. We introduce DeepThinkVLA, which resolves this conflict through a tightly integrated architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, our hybrid-attention decoder generates sequential CoT with causal attention and then switches to bidirectional attention for fast, parallel decoding of action vectors. This design is complemented by a two-stage training pipeline: we first use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to teach the model foundational reasoning, then apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-success rewards to causally align the full reasoning-action sequence with desired outcomes. This synergy leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 97.0% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark. Our ablations confirm the design's effectiveness: the hybrid architecture alone outperforms standard decoders by 15.5%, and the final RL stage provides a crucial 2% boost to secure top performance.</description>

Abstract: Language-conditioned robot manipulation is an emerging field aimed at enabling seamless communication and cooperation between humans and robotic agents by teaching robots to comprehend and execute instructions conveyed in natural language. This interdisciplinary area integrates scene understanding, language processing, and policy learning to bridge the gap between human instructions and robot actions. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically explore recent advancements in language-conditioned robot manipulation. We categorize existing methods based on the primary ways language is integrated into the robot system, namely language for state evaluation, language as a policy condition, and language for cognitive planning and reasoning. Specifically, we further analyze state-of-the-art techniques from four axes of action granularity, data and supervision regimes, system cost and latency, and environments and evaluations. Additionally, we highlight the key debates in the field. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future research directions, focusing on potentially enhancing generalization capabilities and addressing safety issues in language-conditioned robot manipulators.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the increased availability of WiFi in indoor environments has gained interest in the robotics community to utilize WiFi signals for indoor simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms. This paper discusses the challenges of achieving high-accuracy geometric map building using WiFi signals. The paper introduces the concept of inverse k-visibility, developed from the k-visibility algorithm, to identify free space in an unknown environment, used for planning, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Comprehensive experiments, including those utilizing single and multiple RSSI signals, were conducted in both simulated and real-world environments to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, a detailed analysis comparing the resulting maps with ground-truth LiDAR-based maps is provided to highlight the algorithm's accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>LoopSR: Looping Sim-and-Real for Lifelong Policy Adaptation of Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown its remarkable and generalizable capability in legged locomotion through sim-to-real transfer. However, while adaptive methods like domain randomization are expected to enhance policy robustness across diverse environments, they potentially compromise the policy's performance in any specific environment, leading to suboptimal real-world deployment due to the No Free Lunch theorem. To address this, we propose LoopSR, a lifelong policy adaptation framework that continuously refines RL policies in the post-deployment stage. LoopSR employs a transformer-based encoder to map real-world trajectories into a latent space and reconstruct a digital twin of the real world for further improvement. Autoencoder architecture and contrastive learning methods are adopted to enhance feature extraction of real-world dynamics. Simulation parameters for continual training are derived by combining predicted values from the decoder with retrieved parameters from a pre-collected simulation trajectory dataset. By leveraging simulated continual training, LoopSR achieves superior data efficiency compared with strong baselines, yielding eminent performance with limited data in both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real experiments.

      <title>Robust Adaptive Safe Robotic Grasping with Tactile Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic grasping requires safe force interaction to prevent a grasped object from being damaged or slipping out of the hand. In this vein, this paper proposes an integrated framework for grasping with formal safety guarantees based on Control Barrier Functions. We first design contact force and force closure constraints, which are enforced by a safety filter to accomplish safe grasping with finger force control. For sensory feedback, we develop a technique to estimate contact point, force, and torque from tactile sensors at each finger. We verify the framework with various safety filters in a numerical simulation under a two-finger grasping scenario. We then experimentally validate the framework by grasping multiple objects, including fragile lab glassware, in a real robotic setup, showing that safe grasping can be successfully achieved in the real world. We evaluate the performance of each safety filter in the context of safety violation and conservatism, and find that disturbance observer-based control barrier functions provide superior performance for safety guarantees with minimum conservatism.</description>

      <title>Natural Selection via Foundation Models for Soft Robot Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing soft robots is a complex and iterative process that demands cross-disciplinary expertise in materials science, mechanics, and control, often relying on intuition and extensive experimentation. While foundation models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, their capacity to conduct embodied design remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces RoboCrafter-QA, a novel benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs can learn representations of soft robot designs that effectively bridge the gap between high-level task descriptions and low-level morphological and material choices. RoboCrafter-QA leverages the EvoGym simulator to generate a diverse set of soft robot design challenges, spanning robotic locomotion, manipulation, and balancing tasks. Our experiments with SOTA multi-modal LLMs reveal that while these models exhibit promising capabilities in learning design representations, they struggle with fine-grained distinctions between designs with subtle performance differences. To overcome these limitations, we finetune an efficient, open-source LLM that achieves SOTA performance on our benchmark, demonstrating superior capabilities in both design selection and direct generation of high-performing robot morphologies. Furthermore, we construct a physical replica of the modular soft robot and demonstrate a strong sim-to-real correlation, validating that superior benchmark performance has the potential to translate to effective real-world design selection. Our full system will be open-sourced to foster this exciting direction.</description>

      <title>GPA-RAM: Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba for Spatial Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task failures in prior fine-grained robotic manipulation methods often stem from suboptimal initial grasping, which is critical for subsequent manipulation and reducing the requirement for complex pose adjustments. To address this, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA), a general multi-modal learning framework that enhances grasp perception without additional grasp pose data collection and labeling. GPA achieves evident enhancement on RLBench multi-task benchmark (from 79.3% to 84.2%) and ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks (from 86%/16% to 98%/38%). Although GPA enhances fine-grained grasping performance by leveraging increased model capacity, it incurs computational latency and hinders real-time deployment. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM). This architecture synergizes attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs), effectively capturing complex spatial features while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our unified GPA-RAM framework balances model capacity with efficiency and applies to both discrete and continuous action generation. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across four robotic systems with diverse camera configurations in both simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves average success rates by 8.2% over RVT2 (from 79.3% to 87.5%) and 2.6% over ARP^+ (from 84.9% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on ALOHA bimanual continuous tasks, with inference speed of about 71 FPS. This work provides a framework for developing robotic systems that are simultaneously precise and responsive. The project and code are at https://gpa-ram.github.io/</description>

Abstract: Learning natural, animal-like locomotion from demonstrations has become a core paradigm in legged robotics. Despite the recent advancements in motion tracking, most existing methods demand extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability. We present APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient Exploration), a plug-and-play extension to state-of-the-art motion tracking algorithms that eliminates any dependence on reference data during deployment, improves sample efficiency, and reduces parameter tuning effort. APEX integrates expert demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is combined with a multi-critic framework that balances task performance with motion style. Moreover, APEX enables a single policy to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, while remaining robust to variations in reward design. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation and on a Unitree Go2 robot. By leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration during RL training, without imposing explicit bias toward them, APEX enables legged robots to learn with greater stability, efficiency, and generalization. We believe this approach paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in a wide array of robotic tasks, from locomotion to manipulation.

      <description>arXiv:2508.19367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As robots' manipulation capabilities improve for pick-and-place tasks (e.g., object packing, sorting, and kitting), methods focused on understanding human-acceptable object configurations remain limited expressively with regard to capturing spatial relationships important to humans. To advance robotic understanding of human rules for object arrangement, we introduce positionally-augmented RCC (PARCC), a formal logic framework based on region connection calculus (RCC) for describing the relative position of objects in space. Additionally, we introduce an inference algorithm for learning PARCC specifications via demonstrations. Finally, we present the results from a human study, which demonstrate our framework's ability to capture a human's intended specification and the benefits of learning from demonstration approaches over human-provided specifications.</description>

      <title>U2UData+: A Scalable Swarm UAVs Autonomous Flight Dataset for Embodied Long-horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Embodied Long-Horizon (ELH) tasks is crucial for advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world deployment for ELH tasks. ELH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks, requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining embodied persistent states, and adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData+, the first large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for ELH tasks and the first scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous collaborative flights for ELH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120 hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames. This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes, and ELH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData+ also introduces an ELH task for wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models. U2UData+ can be found at https://fengtt42.github.io/U2UData-2/.</description>

      <title>RL-100: Performant Robotic Manipulation with Real-World Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability, efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass the performance of skilled human operators. We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning framework built on diffusion-based visuomotor policies. RL-100 unifies imitation and reinforcement learning under a single PPO-style objective applied within the denoising process, yielding conservative and stable policy improvements across both offline and online stages. To meet deployment latency constraints, we employ a lightweight consistency distillation procedure that compresses multi-step diffusion into a one-step controller for high-frequency control. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic, and supports both single-action outputs and action-chunking control. We evaluate RL-100 on seven diverse real-robot manipulation tasks, ranging from dynamic pushing and agile bowling to pouring, cloth folding, unscrewing, and multi-stage juicing. RL-100 attains 100% success across evaluated trials, achieving 900 out of 900 successful episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task, and matches or surpasses expert teleoperators in time-to-completion. Without retraining, a single policy attains approximately 90% zero-shot success under environmental and dynamics shifts, adapts in a few-shot regime to significant task variations (86.7%), and remains robust to aggressive human perturbations (about 95%). In a public shopping-mall deployment, the juicing robot served random customers continuously for roughly seven hours without failure. Together, these results suggest a practical path toward deployment-ready robot learning: start from human priors, align training objectives with human-grounded metrics, and reliably extend performance beyond human demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Maestro: Orchestrating Robotics Modules with Vision-Language Models for Zero-Shot Generalist Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's best-explored routes towards generalist robots center on collecting ever larger "observations-in actions-out" robotics datasets to train large end-to-end models, copying a recipe that has worked for vision-language models (VLMs). We pursue a road less traveled: building generalist policies directly around VLMs by augmenting their general capabilities with specific robot capabilities encapsulated in a carefully curated set of perception, planning, and control modules. In Maestro, a VLM coding agent dynamically composes these modules into a programmatic policy for the current task and scenario. Maestro's architecture benefits from a streamlined closed-loop interface without many manually imposed structural constraints, and a comprehensive and diverse tool repertoire. As a result, it largely surpasses today's VLA models for zero-shot performance on challenging manipulation skills. Further, Maestro is easily extensible to incorporate new modules, easily editable to suit new embodiments such as a quadruped-mounted arm, and even easily adapts from minimal real-world experiences through local code edits.</description>

Abstract: Post-disaster situations pose unique navigation challenges. One of those challenges is the unstructured nature of the environment, which makes it hard to layout paths for rescue vehicles. We propose the use of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in such scenario to perform reconnaissance across the environment. To accomplish this, we propose an optimization-based approach to plan a path for the UAV at optimal height where the sensors of the UAV can cover the most area and collect data with minimum uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Consistency Embodied World Model with Multi-View Trajectory Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied world models aim to predict and interact with the physical world through visual observations and actions. However, existing models struggle to accurately translate low-level actions (e.g., joint positions) into precise robotic movements in predicted frames, leading to inconsistencies with real-world physical interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MTV-World, an embodied world model that introduces Multi-view Trajectory-Video control for precise visuomotor prediction. Specifically, instead of directly using low-level actions for control, we employ trajectory videos obtained through camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and Cartesian-space transformation as control signals. However, projecting 3D raw actions onto 2D images inevitably causes a loss of spatial information, making a single view insufficient for accurate interaction modeling. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-view framework that compensates for spatial information loss and ensures high-consistency with physical world. MTV-World forecasts future frames based on multi-view trajectory videos as input and conditioning on an initial frame per view. Furthermore, to systematically evaluate both robotic motion precision and object interaction accuracy, we develop an auto-evaluation pipeline leveraging multimodal large models and referring video object segmentation models. To measure spatial consistency, we formulate it as an object location matching problem and adopt the Jaccard Index as the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-World achieves precise control execution and accurate physical interaction modeling in complex dual-arm scenarios.</description>

      <title>Searching in Space and Time: Unified Memory-Action Loops for Open-World Object Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Service robots must retrieve objects in dynamic, open-world settings where requests may reference attributes ("the red mug"), spatial context ("the mug on the table"), or past states ("the mug that was here yesterday"). Existing approaches capture only parts of this problem: scene graphs capture spatial relations but ignore temporal grounding, temporal reasoning methods model dynamics but do not support embodied interaction, and dynamic scene graphs handle both but remain closed-world with fixed vocabularies. We present STAR (SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval), a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions within a single decision loop. STAR leverages non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory to support efficient recall, and uses a vision-language model to select either temporal or spatial actions at each step. We introduce STARBench, a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments. Experiments in STARBench and on a Tiago robot show that STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines, demonstrating the benefits of treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.</description>

      <title>Is Your VLM for Autonomous Driving Safety-Ready? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating External and In-Cabin Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method that mitigates the rigidity of fixed reward structures and the limited flexibility of implicit reward regularization. Building on the Maximum Entropy IRL framework, our approach incorporates a squared temporal-difference (TD) regularizer with adaptive targets that evolve dynamically during training, thereby imposing adaptive bounds on recovered rewards and promoting robust decision-making. To capture richer return information, we integrate distributional RL into the learning process. Empirically, our method achieves expert-level performance on complex MuJoCo and Adroit environments, surpassing baseline methods on the Humanoid-v2 task with limited expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the approach and provide insights into reward dynamics in imitation learning.

      <title>Class-Aware PillarMix: Can Mixed Sample Data Augmentation Enhance 3D Object Detection with Radar Point Clouds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the significant effort required for data collection and annotation in 3D perception tasks, mixed sample data augmentation (MSDA) has been widely studied to generate diverse training samples by mixing existing data. Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data.</description>

Abstract: We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $\pi^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $\pi^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.</description>
