      <title>Non-Hermitian skin effect in fragmented Hilbert spaces of one-dimensional femionic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover that the interplay between Hilbert space fragmentation and multiple non-Hermitian pumping channels leads to distinct non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in real and Fock spaces. Using an extended Hatano-Nelson model with next-nearest neighbor hopping and a strong interaction as an example, we find that two fermions loaded in the lattice exhibit different real-space NHSE depending on the Hilbert space fragments they belong to. Moreover, in the high-energy sector resulting from the fragmentation, the two-particle bound states form a one-dimensional lattice in Fock space, resulting in the Fock-space NHSE. At half-filling, while real-space NHSE is suppressed by many-body effects, richer patterns of Fock-space skin-like localization are found to emerge for different fragmented energy sectors and subsectors. This work extends our understanding of the interplay between NHSE and Hilbert space fragmentation and provides detailed insights into their manifestation in interacting non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Rotating nonlinear states in trapped binary Bose-Einstein condensates under the action of the spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of systematic analysis of confined steadily rotating patterns in the two-component BEC including the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the Rashba type, which acts in the interplay with the attractive or repulsive intra-component and inter-component nonlinear interactions and confining potential. The analysis is based on the system of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) written in the rotating coordinates. The resulting GPE system includes effective Zeeman splitting. In the case of the attractive nonlinearity, the analysis, performed by means of the imaginary-time simulations, produces deformation of the known two-dimensional SOC solitons (semi-vortices and mixed-modes). Essentially novel findings are reported in the case of the repulsive nonlinearity. They demonstrate patterns arranged as chains of unitary vortices which, at smaller values of the rotation velocity Omega, assume the straight (single-string) form. At larger Omega, the straight chains become unstable, being spontaneously replaced by a trilete star-shaped array of vortices. At still large values of Omega, the trilete pattern rebuilds itself into a star-shaped one formed of five and, then, seven strings. The transitions between the different patterns are accounted for by comparison of their energy. It is shown that the straight chains of vortices, which form the star-shaped structures, are aligned with boundaries between domains populated by plane waves with different wave vectors. A transition from an axisymmetric higher-order (multiple) vortex state to the trilete pattern is investigated too.</description>

      <title>Yrast states of quantum droplets confined in a ring potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a quantum droplet which is confined in a ring potential. We investigate the so-called "yrast" state, i.e., the lowest-energy state of the droplet assuming that it has some fixed expectation value of the angular momentum. Two are the most interesting aspects of this problem, the nonlinear term -- which is partly attractive and partly repulsive -- and the periodic boundary conditions. For some range of the parameters, the attractive, or the repulsive part of the nonlinear term dominates and one gets the expected behavior. In some intermediate regime the two nonlinear terms are of comparable size. In this case both the solution, as well as the corresponding dispersion relation show an interesting behavior. Finally, we make contact with the problem of solitary-wave excitation, since the derived solutions are travelling-wave, i.e., solitary-wave, solutions.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of collective modes in a Bose-Einstein condensate: from single to double zones of excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective modes are coherent excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), and their study provides insight into the macroscopic quantum phenomena that govern these systems. Collective mode frequencies can be used to probe the properties of BECs, such as the trap geometry, the interatomic interactions, and the presence of defects; hence, it is essential to develop methods for high-resolution determination of collective mode frequencies. A standard technique consists of a single pulse of an external oscillatory field, which we denote Rabi-like due to the analogy with the field of nuclear magnetic resonances. In this work, we propose a method to achieve a better resolution than the Rabi-like protocol, which consists of two oscillating fields separated in time, which we call Ramsey-like. We focus on BECs in harmonic traps, considering mainly the quadrupole and breathing modes for different trap anisotropy values and comparing the results using single and double excitation zones. First, we employ a variational approach with a Thomas-Fermi ansatz, which gives rise to dynamical equations that are numerically solved. Then, we modeled the problem as a three-level system, offering a concise and alternative description of the same dynamics, enabling the idea of coherent control of these collective modes. Both approaches show that the Ramsey-like protocol provides a better resolution than the Rabi-like. This offers the possibility of measuring collective mode frequencies with higher precision, which is important in experiments where they are used as indirect measurements of properties that are difficult to probe.</description>

      <title>Impurities in Schr\"{o}dinger field theories and s-wave resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study point impurities in non-relativistic quantum field theories, with a focus on scale-invariant fixed points. We establish the framework of conformal defects in Schr\"{o}dinger field theories and their correspondence to many-body states in a harmonic trap. We discuss a multi-critical quantization of the one-body wave function induced by an impurity, with examples of free and unitary Fermi gases. Our results can potentially be tested in experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Optimal recoil-free state preparation in an optical atom tweezer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing in atom tweezers requires high-fidelity implementations of quantum operations. Here, we demonstrate the optimal implementation of the transition $|0\rangle \rightarrow |1\rangle$ of two levels, serving as a qubit, of an atom in a tweezer potential, driven by a single-photon Rabi pulse. The Rabi pulse generates a photon recoil of the atom, due to the Lamb-Dicke coupling between the internal and motional degree of freedom, driving the system out of the logical subspace. This detrimental effect is strongly suppressed in the protocols that we propose. Using pulse engineering, we generate optimal protocols composed of a Rabi protocol and a force protocol, corresponding to dynamically displacing the tweezer. We generate these for a large parameter space, from small to large values of the Rabi frequency, and a range of pulse lengths. We identify three main regimes for the optimal protocols, and discuss their properties. In all of these regimes, we demonstrate infidelity well below the current technological standard, thus mitigating a universal challenge in atom tweezers and other quantum technology platforms.</description>

      <title>Geometric fractionalized Fermi liquids: Hidden antiferromagnetism and pseudogap from fluctuating stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) phases. The topological nature of the FL* phase has been identified as a scenario compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative FL* scenario: a fractionalized Fermi liquid with a geometric origin (GFL*) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GFL* framework provides a compelling connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Non-Markovian and Coherent Errors Using Quantum Process Tomography of Proxy States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting mitigating and correcting errors in quantum control is among the most pertinent contemporary problems in quantum technologies. We consider three of the most common bosonic error correction codes -- the CLY, binomial and dual rail and compare their performance under typical errors in bosonic systems. We find that the dual rail code shows the best performance. We also develop a new technique for error mitigation in quantum control. We consider a quantum system with large Hilbert space dimension, e.g., a qudit or a multi-qubit system and construct two $2- $ dimensional subspaces -- a code space, $\mathcal C = \text{span}\{|\bar{0}\rangle, |\bar{1}\rangle\}$ where the logical qubit is encoded and a ``proxy'' space $\mathcal P = \text{span}\{|\bar{0}'\rangle, |\bar{1}'\rangle\}$. While the qubit (i.e., $\mathcal C$) can be a part of a quantum circuit, the proxy (i.e., $\mathcal P$) remains idle. In the absence of errors, the quantum state of the proxy qubit does not evolve in time. If $\mathcal E$ is an error channel acting on the full system, we consider its projections on $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal P$ represented as pauli transfer matrices $T_{\mathcal E}$ and $T'_{\mathcal E}$ respectively. Under reasonable assumptions regarding the origin of the errors, $T_{\mathcal E}$ can be inferred from $T'_{\mathcal E}$ acting on the proxy qubit and the latter can be measured without affecting the qubit. The latter can be measured while the qubit is a part of a quantum circuit because, one can perform simultaneous measurements on the logical and the proxy qubits. We use numerical data to learn an \textit{affine map} $\phi$ such that $T_{\mathcal E} \approx \phi(T'_{\mathcal E})$. We also show that the inversion of a suitable proxy space's logical pauli transfer matrix can effectively mitigate the noise on the two modes bosonic system or two qudits system.</description>

      <title>Programming an Optical Lattice Interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programming a quantum device describes the usage of quantum logic gates, agnostic of hardware specifics, to perform a sequence of operations with (typically) a computing or sensing task in mind. Such programs have been executed on digital quantum computers, which despite their noisy character, have shown the ability to optimize metrological functions, for example in the generation of spin squeezing and optimization of quantum Fisher information for signals manifesting as spin rotations in a quantum register. However, the qubits of these programmable quantum sensors are tightly spatially confined and therefore suboptimal for enclosing the kinds of large spacetime areas required for performing inertial sensing. In this work, we derive a set of quantum logic gates for a cold atom optical lattice interferometer that manipulates the momentum of atoms. Here, the operations are framed in terms of single qubit operations and mappings between qubit subspaces with internal levels given by the Bloch (crystal) eigenstates of the lattice. We describe how the quantum optimal control method of direct collocation is well suited for obtaining the modulation waveforms of the lattice which achieve these operations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a quasi-ergodic steady state in a dissipative Tavis-Cummings array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an atom-photon interacting system described by Tavis Cummings Hubbard (TCH) model, we demonstrate the emergence of a quasi-steady state in a dissipative environment that exhibits intriguing ergodic behavior. The TCH model undergoes a dissipative transition from normal to superradiant phase hosting a gapped Higgs and gapless Goldstone modes. However, in a large region of the phase diagram, the instability of the Goldstone mode leads to the disappearance of the stable superradiant phase. In this regime, the decorrelator dynamics reveals light cone spreading of the perturbations and positive Lyapunov exponent, indicating enhanced fluctuations. Remarkably, a quasi-steady state emerges under quench dynamics in this unstable regime; in this state, a class of collective quantities such as site averaged photon number and atomic excitations approach a steady value, in spite of large temporal fluctuations in corresponding microscopic variables. This quasi-steady state describes an incoherent fluid of photons with significant phase fluctuation. The phase space dynamics reveals a fascinating ergodic behavior in presence of dissipation, leading to the characterization of the dynamical variables into two distinct classes. The first class includes site-averaged photon numbers and atomic excitations; these exhibit a stationary distribution regardless of the initial condition indicating ergodic behavior. The second class of variables, particularly those related to phase in contrast, retain information about the initial conditions, resulting in a violation of ergodicity for finite size system. Additionally, the dynamical variables of the ergodic class exhibit fascinating collective scarring phenomenon as the peak of their distribution is attracted towards the unstable steady state, analogous to the single particle quantum scar. We discuss the relevance of our findings in the current experiments.</description>
