      <title>Inverse Design of Copolymers Including Stoichiometry and Chain Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for innovative synthetic polymers with improved properties is high, but their structural complexity and vast design space hinder rapid discovery. Machine learning-guided molecular design is a promising approach to accelerate polymer discovery. However, the scarcity of labeled polymer data and the complex hierarchical structure of synthetic polymers make generative design particularly challenging. We advance the current state-of-the-art approaches to generate not only repeating units, but monomer ensembles including their stoichiometry and chain architecture. We build upon a recent polymer representation that includes stoichiometries and chain architectures of monomer ensembles and develop a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture encoding a graph and decoding a string. Using a semi-supervised setup, we enable the handling of partly labelled datasets which can be benefitial for domains with a small corpus of labelled data. Our model learns a continuous, well organized latent space (LS) that enables de-novo generation of copolymer structures including different monomer stoichiometries and chain architectures. In an inverse design case study, we demonstrate our model for in-silico discovery of novel conjugated copolymer photocatalysts for hydrogen production using optimization of the polymer's electron affinity and ionization potential in the latent space.</description>

      <title>Shear thickening inside elastic open-cell foams under dynamic compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the response of open-cell polyurethane foams filled with a dense suspension of fumed silica particles in polyethylene glycol at compression speeds spanning several orders of magnitude. The gradual compressive stress increase of the composite material indicates the existence of shear rate gradients in the interstitial suspension caused by wide distributions in pore sizes in the disordered foam network. The energy dissipated during compression scales with an effective internal shear rate, allowing for the collapse of three data sets for different pore-size foams. When scaled by this effective shear rate, the most pronounced energy increase coincides with the effective shear rate corresponding to the onset of shear thickening in our bulk suspension. Optical measurements of the radial deformation of the foam network and of the suspension flow under compression provide additional insight into the interaction between shear thickening fluid and foam. This optical data, combined with a simple model of a spring submerged in viscous flow, illustrates the dynamic interaction of viscous drag with foam elasticity as a function of compression rate, and identifies the foam pore size distribution as a critically important model parameter. Taken together, the stress measurements, dissipated energy, and relative motion of the fluid and the foam can be rationalized by knowing the pore size distribution and the average pore size of the foam.</description>

      <title>Acoustic signaling enables collective perception and control in active matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snake-like self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision-making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.</description>

      <title>Probing 3D Velocity Distributions Insights from a Vibrated Dual-Species Granular System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the velocity distributions in a vibrated binary granular gas system, focusing on how these distributions are influenced by the coefficient of restitution (CoR) and the inelasticity of particle collisions. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the system's behavior for a range of CoR values below unity: specifically, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, and 0.95. We track the evolution of velocity distributions as the system approaches a non-equilibrium steady state. Our findings reveal a clear departure from the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, with increasing deviations as CoR decreases, indicating non-equipartition of energy between the two particle types. This behavior underscores the intricate dynamics inherent in inelastic collisions and highlights the significance of particle inelasticity in determining the system's velocity distributions. These results provide insight into non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and have implications for real-world applications where granular materials are subject to external vibrations.</description>

      <title>Ionic association and Wien effect in 2D confined electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental advances in nanofluidics have allowed to explore ion transport across molecular-scale pores, in particular for iontronic applications. Two dimensional nanochannels - in which a single molecular layer of electrolyte is confined between solid walls - constitute a unique platform to investigate fluid and ion transport in extreme confinement, highlighting unconventional transport properties. In this work, we study ionic association in 2D nanochannels, and its consequences on non-linear ionic transport, using both molecular dynamics simulations and analytical theory. We show that under sufficient confinement, ions assemble into pairs or larger clusters in a process analogous to a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, here modified by the dielectric confinement. We further show that the breaking of pairs results in an electric-field dependent conduction, a mechanism usually known as the second Wien effect. However the 2D nature of the system results in non-universal, temperature-dependent, scaling of the conductivity with electric field, leading to ionic coulomb blockade in some regimes. A 2D generalization of the Onsager theory fully accounts for the non-linear transport. These results suggest ways to exploit electrostatic interactions between ions to build new nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution of Decentralized Decision-Making in N-Bead Swimmers Leads to Scalable and Robust Collective Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09438v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many microorganisms swim by performing larger non-reciprocal shape deformations that are initiated locally by molecular motors. However, it remains unclear how decentralized shape control determines the movement of the entire organism. Here, we investigate how efficient locomotion emerges from coordinated yet simple and decentralized decision-making of the body parts using neuroevolution techniques. Our approach allows us to investigate optimal locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies, with emerging long-wavelength body shape deformations corresponding to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. The obtained decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning morphological changes or defects and can be applied to artificial microswimmers for cargo transport or drug delivery applications without further optimization "out of the box". Our work is of relevance to understanding and developing robust navigation strategies of biological and artificial microswimmers and, in a broader context, for understanding emergent levels of individuality and the role of collective intelligence in Artificial Life.</description>

      <title>Multi-Motor Cargo Navigation in Complex Cytoskeletal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinesin superfamily of motor proteins is a major driver of anterograde transport of vesicles and organelles within eukaryotic cells via microtubules. Numerous studies have elucidated the step-size, velocities, forces, and navigation ability of kinesins both in reconstituted systems and in live cells. Outside of cells, the kinesin-based transport is physically regulated and can be controlled by obstacles or defects in the path, or the interaction between several motors on the same cargo. To explore the physical control parameters on kinesin-driven transport, we created complex microtubule networks in vitro to test how kinesin cargoes made from quantum dots with one to 10 kinesin motors attached are able to navigate the network. We find that many motors on the quantum dot significantly alter distance walked, time spent bound, the average speed, and the tortuosity of the cargo. We also find that the average mesh size of the microtubule network affects the end-to-end distance of the motion, the run time, average speed and tortuosity of cargoes. Thus, both motor number and network density are physical aspects that regulate where cargoes traverse in space and time.</description>

      <title>Analysis of local structure of mechanical and thermal rearrangements in glasses with the atomic cluster expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the structural signatures of excitations in amorphous materials with the atomic cluster expansion (ACE), a universal and complete linear basis of descriptors of the atomic environment. Body-orderd linear classifiers are constructed that distinguish between active and inactive particles in three different model glass formers, in which structural relaxation occurs either through spontaneous thermal activation or by simple shear. We find that in binary mixtures, maximum prediction accuracy is already achieved with very few two-body correlations, while a polymer glass requires both two- and three-body correlations. Trends are robust across both activation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Elastocapillarity-driven surface growth in tumour spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing experimental evidence highlights the relevant role of mechanics in the physiology of solid tumours, even in their early stages. While most of the mathematical models describe tumour growth as a volumetric increase of mass in the bulk, in vitro experiments on tumour spheroids have demonstrated that cell proliferation occurs in a thin layer at the boundary of the cellular aggregate. In this work, we investigate how elasticity and surface tension interact during the development of tumour spheroids. We model the tumour as a hyperelastic material undergoing boundary accretion, where the newly created cells are deformed by the action of surface tension. This growth leads to a frustrated reference configuration, resulting in the appearance of residual stress.Our theoretical framework is validated through experimental results of tumour spheroid cutting. Similar to fully developed tumours, spheroids tend to open when subject to radial cuts. Remarkably, even newly formed spheroids, which lack residual stress, exhibit this behaviour. Through both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we show that this phenomenon is driven by elastocapillary interactions, where the residual stress developed in grown spheroids amplifies the tumour opening. Our model's outcomes align with experimental observations and allow us to estimate the surface tension acting on tumour spheroids.</description>

      <title>Receptors cluster in high-curvature membrane regions for optimal spatial gradient sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial information from cell-surface receptors is crucial for processes that require signal processing and sensing of the environment. Here, we investigate the optimal placement of such receptors through a theoretical model that minimizes uncertainty in gradient estimation. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the physical limits of sensing or biochemical processes, we reproduce the emergence of clusters that closely resemble those observed in real cells. On perfect spherical surfaces, optimally placed receptors spread uniformly. When perturbations break their symmetry, receptors cluster in regions of high curvature, massively reducing estimation uncertainty. This agrees with mechanistic models that minimize elastic preference discrepancies between receptors and cell membranes. We further extend our model to motile receptors responding to cell-shape changes and external fluid flow, demonstrating the relevance of our model in realistic scenarios. Our findings provide a simple and utilitarian explanation for receptor clustering at high-curvature regions when high sensing accuracy is paramount.</description>

Abstract: Using nonequilibrium computer simulations, we study the response of ferromagnetic nanofilaments, consisting of stabilized onedimensional chains of ferromagnetic nanoparticles, under external rotating magnetic fields. In difference with their analogous microscale and stiff counterparts, which have been actively studied in recent years, nonequilibrium properties of rather flexible nanoparticle filaments remain mostly unexplored. By progressively increasing the modeling details, we are able to evidence the qualitative impact of main interactions that can not be neglected at the nanoscale, showing that filament flexibility, thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions contribute independently to broaden the range of synchronous frequency response in this system. Furthermore, we also show the existence of a limited set of characteristic dynamic filament configurations and discuss in detail the asynchronous response, which at finite temperature becomes probabilistic.</description>

Abstract: I formulate the theory of three dimensional "Malthusian flocks" -- i.e., coherently moving collections of self-propelled entities (such as living creatures) which are being "born" and "dying" during their motion -- whose constituents all have a preference for having their velocity vectors lie parallel to the same two-dimensional plane. I determine the universal scaling exponents characterizing such systems exactly, finding that the dynamical exponent $z=3/2$, the "anisotropy" exponent $\zeta=3/4$, and the "roughness" exponent $\chi=-1/2$. I also give the scaling laws implied by these exponents.</description>

      <title>Solvent-cosolvent attraction is sufficient to induce polymer collapse in good solvent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when two miscible, competing good solvents for a polymer are mixed, resulting in a loss of solubility. In this study, we demonstrate through simulations, supported by theory, that cononsolvency can be driven solely by solvent-cosolvent attraction ($\epsilon_{sc}$). The primary mechanism underlying this behavior is the emergent depletion effect, which is amplified by solvent-cosolvent interactions. The polymer reaches a compact state when the solvent and cosolvent fractions are equal ($x_s = x_c = 0.5$), a finding that aligns with predictions from Flory-Huggins theory and the random phase approximation. We show that this cononsolvency behavior is observed for different cosolvent sizes, provided the cosolvent density remains below the depletion threshold and the sizes of solvent and cosolvent particles are not smaller than the monomer size. Additionally, we investigate the role of temperature and find that cononsolvency weakens as temperature increases, due to a reduction in the depletion effect. Finally, we show that when preferential cosolvent attraction is introduced in this simple model, it leads to cononsolvency driven by bridging interactions, occurring at lower cosolvent fractions ($x_c &lt; 0.5$).</description>

      <title>A Reaction-Diffusion-Chemotaxis Model for Human Population Dynamics over Fractal Terrains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advection of entities induced by gradients in attractant concentration fields is observed via diffusiophoresis in colloids and via chemotaxis in microorganisms. Mathematically, both diffusiophoresis and chemotaxis follow similar mathematical descriptions and display a variety of interesting behaviors that are not observed through other transport mechanisms. However, the application of such a mathematical framework has largely been restricted to soft matter research. In this article, we argue that this framework is more general and can be expanded to study human population dynamics. We assert that human populations also migrate chemotactically, but by sensing concentrations gradients in attractants such as resource availability, social connections, and safety indices. Therefore, we extend the Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, foundational to human population dynamics, to incorporate chemotactic advection. Furthermore, we introduce a fractal terrain to better mimic the human dispersal phenomena. Simulations demonstrate that, by including chemotaxis of a population toward attractants which are dispersed heterogenously over fractal terrains, population hotspots can appear from from initially uniformly dispersed states whereas Fisher-KPP without chemotaxis predicts a persistent tendency toward population uniformity. Varying the chemotactic migration yields fine control over inter- or intra-population segregation and thus the population growth rates may be substantially altered by considering the population-attractant coupling. This framework may be useful for characterizing historical population separations, and furthermore is particularly pertinent for predicting emergence of new population hotspots as climate change is expected to cause large-scale human displacement, which may be dictated by chemotactic movement of humans due to evolving concentration gradients in safety indices.</description>
