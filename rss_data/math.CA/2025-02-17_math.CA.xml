      <title>Reconstruction of frequency-localized functions from pointwise samples via least squares and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering frequency-localized functions from pointwise data is a fundamental task in signal processing. We examine this problem from an approximation-theoretic perspective, focusing on least squares and deep learning-based methods. First, we establish a novel recovery theorem for least squares approximations using the Slepian basis from uniform random samples in low dimensions, explicitly tracking the dependence of the bandwidth on the sampling complexity. Building on these results, we then present a recovery guarantee for approximating bandlimited functions via deep learning from pointwise data. This result, framed as a practical existence theorem, provides conditions on the network architecture, training procedure, and data acquisition sufficient for accurate approximation. To complement our theoretical findings, we perform numerical comparisons between least squares and deep learning for approximating one- and two-dimensional functions. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical limitations and the practical gaps between theory and implementation.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the generalized principal eigenvalue of cooperative nonlocal dispersal systems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that, in the study of the dynamical properties of nonlinear evolution system with nonlocal dispersals, the principal eigenvalue of linearized system play an important role. However, due to lack of compactness, in order to obtain the existence of principal eigenvalue, certain additional conditions must be attached to the coefficients. In this paper, we approximate the generalized principal eigenvalue of nonlocal dispersal cooperative and irreducible system, which admits the Collatz-Wielandt characterization, by constructing the monotonic upper and lower control systems with principal eigenvalues; and show that the generalized principal eigenvalue plays the same role as the usual principal eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Edge detection with polynomial frames on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article, we have shown that a variety of localized polynomial frames, including isotropic as well as directional systems, are suitable for detecting jump discontinuities along circles on the sphere. More precisely, such edges can be identified in terms of their position and orientation by the asymptotic decay of the frame coefficients in an arbitrary small neighborhood. In this paper, we will extend these results to discontinuities which lie along general smooth curves. In particular, we prove upper and lower estimates for the frame coefficients when the analysis function is concentrated in the vicinity of such a singularity. The estimates are given in an asymptotic sense, with respect to some dilation parameter, and they hold uniformly in a neighborhood of the smooth curve segment under consideration.</description>

      <title>Completeness of sparse and finite local complexity sequences of translates in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a nonnegative function $g$ and a set $\Lambda = \{\lambda_1 &lt; \lambda_2 &lt; \dots\}$ of positive real numbers such that the system $\{g(x-\lambda_n)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is complete simultaneously in all $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ spaces, $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, and $\Lambda$ satisfies one of the following two additional conditions: either $\Lambda$ is very sparse, namely, the ratios $\lambda_{n+1}/\lambda_n$ tend to $1$ arbitrarily slowly; or the differences $\lambda_{n+1} - \lambda_n$ attain only two different values, so $\Lambda$ has finite local complexity. Both constructions are, in a sense, extreme: it is well known that $\Lambda$ cannot be Hadamard lacunary and cannot be contained in any arithmetic progression.</description>

      <title>Point configurations in sets of sufficient topological structure and a topological {E}rd\H{o}s similarity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the occurrence of point configurations within non-meager (second category) Baire sets. A celebrated result of Steinhaus asserts that $A+B$ and $A-B$ contain an interval whenever $A$ and $B$ are sets of positive Lebesgue measure in $\R^n$ for $n\geq 1$. A topological analogue attributed to Piccard asserts that both $AB$ and $AB^{-1}$ contain an interval when $A,B$ are non-meager (second category) Baire sets in a topological group. We explore generalizations of Piccard's result to more complex point configurations and more abstract spaces. In the Euclidean setting, we show that if $A\subset \R^d$ is a non-meager Baire set and $F=\{x_n\}_{n\in\N}$ is a bounded sequence, then there is an interval of scalings $t$ for which $tF+z\subset A$ for some $z\in \R^d$. That is, the set $$\Delta_F(A)=\{t\in\R: \exists z\text{ such that }tF+z\subset A\}$$ has nonempty interior. More generally, if $V$ is a topological vector space and $F=\{x_n\}_{n\in\N}\subset V$ is a bounded sequence, we show that if $A\subset V$ is non-meager and Baire, then $\Delta_F(A)$ has nonempty interior. The notion of boundedness in this context is described below. Note that the sequence $F$ can be countably infinite, which distinguishes this result from its measure-theoretic analogue. In the context of the topological version of Erd\H{o}s' similarity conjecture, we show that bounded countable sets are universal in non-meager Baire sets.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of slices of compact sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\theta$ intermediate dimensions are a continuous family of dimensions that interpolate between Hausdorff and Box dimensions of fractal sets. In this paper we study the problem of the relationship between the dimension of a set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ and the dimension of the slices $E\cap V$ from the point of view of intermediate dimensions. Here $V\in G(d,m)$, where $G(d,m)$ is the set of $m-$dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We obtain upper bounds analogous to those already known for Hausdorff dimension. In addition, we prove several corollaries referring to, among other things, the continuity of these dimensions at $\theta=0$, a natural problem that arises when studying them. We also investigate which conditions are sufficient to obtain a lower bound that provides an equality for almost all slices. Finally, a new type of Frostman measures is introduced. These measures combine the results already known for intermediate dimensions and Frostman measures in the case of Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Fourier dimension of the graph of fractional Brownian motion with $H \ge 1/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Fourier dimension of the graph of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index greater than $1/2$ is almost surely 1. This extends the result of Fraser and Sahlsten (2018) for the Brownian motion and verifies partly the conjecture of Fraser, Orponen and Sahlsten (2014). We introduce a combinatorial integration by parts formula to compute the moments of the Fourier transform of the graph measure. The proof of our main result is based on this integration by parts formula together with Fa\`a di Bruno's formula and strong local nondeterminism of fractional Brownian motion. We also show that the Fourier dimension of the graph of a symmetric $\alpha$-stable process with $\alpha\in[1,2]$ is almost surely 1.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Solutions for Reaction-diffusion-convection Models with Accumulation Term and Aggregative Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the wavefront solutions of parabolic partial differential equations of the type \[ g(u)u_{\tau}+f(u)u_{x}=\left(D(u)u_{x}\right)_{x}+\rho(u),\quad u\left(\tau,x\right)\in[0,1] \] where the reaction term $\rho$ is of monostable-type. We allow the diffusivity $D$ and the accumulation term $g$ to have a finite number of changes of sign.
  We provide an existence result of travelling wave solutions (t.w.s.) together with an estimate of the threshold wave speed. Finally, we classify the t.w.s. between classical and sharp ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the solvability of the following doubly singular boundary value problem \[\begin{cases} \dot z = c g(u)-f(u) -\dfrac{h(u)}{z^\alpha}\\ z(0^+)=0, z(1^-)=0, \ z(u)&gt;0 \text{ in } (0,1)\end{cases}\] naturally arising in the study of the existence and properties of travelling waves for reaction-diffusion-convection equations governed by the $p-$Laplacian operator.
  Here $c,\alpha$ are real parameters, with $\alpha&gt;0$, and $f,g,h$ are continuous functions in $[0,1]$, with \[ h(0)=h(1), \quad h(u)&gt;0 \text{ in } (0,1).\]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzian derivative plays a fundamental role in complex analysis, differential equations, and modular forms. In this paper, we investigate its higher-order generalizations, known as higher Schwarzians, and their connections to quasimodular forms and equivariant functions. We prove that a meromorphic function is equivariant if and only if its higher Schwarzians are quasimodular forms of prescribed weight and depth, thereby extending classical results and linking projective differential operators to the structure of modular and quasimodular forms.</description>

      <title>Geometric approach for the identification of Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some new Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type are presented and the analogue of Okamoto's space of initial conditions computed. Using the geometric approach that was introduced originally for the identification problem of Painlev\'e equations, comparing the irreducible components of the inaccessible divisors arising in the blow-up process, we find bi-rational coordinate changes between some of these systems that give rise to the same global Hamiltonian structure. This scheme thus gives a method for identifying Hamiltonian systems up to bi-rational maps, which is performed in this article for systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type having singularities that are either square-root type algebraic poles or ordinary poles.</description>

Abstract: A recent asymptotic expansion for the positive zeros $x=j_{\nu,m}$ ($m=1,2,3,\ldots$) of the Bessel function of the first kind $J_{\nu}(x)$ is studied, where the order $\nu$ is positive. Unlike previous well-known expansions in the literature, this is uniformly valid for one or both $m$ and $\nu$ unbounded, namely $m=1,2,3,\ldots$ and $1 \leq \nu &lt; \infty$. Explicit and simple lower and upper error bounds are derived for the difference between $j_{\nu,m}$ and the first three terms of the expansion. The bounds are sharp in the sense they are close to the value of the fourth term of the expansion (i.e. the first neglected term).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For suitable kernels on a locally compact space, we develop a theory of inner (outer) pseudo-balayage of quite general signed Radon measures (not necessarily of finite energy) onto quite general sets (not necessarily closed). Such investigations were initiated in Fuglede's study (Anal. Math., 2016), which was, however, mainly concerned with the outer pseudo-balayage of positive measures of finite energy. The results thereby obtained solve Fuglede's problem, posed to the author in a private correspondence (2016), whether his theory could be extended to measures of infinite energy. An application of this theory to weighted minimum energy problems is also given.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like Schr\"odinger Operators at Low Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>

      <title>On the Folklore set and Dirichlet spectrum for matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Folklore set of Dirichlet improvable matrices in $\mathbb R^{m\times n}$ which are neither singular nor badly approximable. We prove the non-emptiness for all positive integer pairs $m,n$ apart from $\{m,n\}=\{ 1,1\}$ and $\{m,n\}=\{ 2,3\}$ in a constructive manner. For a wide range of integer pairs $(m,n)$ we construct subsets of the Folklore set with an exact prescribed Dirichlet constant (in some right neighbourhood of $0$). This enables us to provide information on the Dirichlet Spectrum of matrices. The key technique of our construction is to build first vectors of a given Diophantine type, and then to show that most `liftings' to matrices will preserve this Diophantine type. This is a variant of a method introduced by Moshchevitin for uniform approximation. Our technique is often also applicable to arbitrary norms. As a corollary, we obtain lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of these sets. These statements complement previous results of the middle-named author (Selecta Math. 2023), Beresnevich et. al. (Adv. Math. 2023), and Das et. al. (Adv. Math. 2024).</description>

Abstract: In this paper we shall use the abstract bifurcation theorems developed by the author in previous papers to study bifurcations of solutions for Lagrangian systems on manifolds linearly or nonlinearly dependent on parameters under various boundary value conditions. As applications, many bifurcation results for geodesics on Finsler and Riemannian manifolds are derived.</description>
