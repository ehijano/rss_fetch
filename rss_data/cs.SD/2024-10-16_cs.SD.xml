      <title>Audio Captioning via Generative Pair-to-Pair Retrieval with Refined Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio understanding tasks leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, adapting LLMs to learn audio concepts requires massive training data and substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves audio-text pairs from a knowledge base (KB) and augments them with query audio to generate accurate textual responses. In RAG, the relevance of the retrieved information plays a crucial role in effectively processing the input. In this paper, we analyze how different retrieval methods and knowledge bases impact the relevance of audio-text pairs and the performance of audio captioning with RAG. We propose generative pair-to-pair retrieval, which uses the generated caption as a text query to accurately find relevant audio-text pairs to the query audio, thereby improving the relevance and accuracy of retrieved information. Additionally, we refine the large-scale knowledge base to retain only audio-text pairs that align with the contextualized intents. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks including AudioCaps, Clotho, and Auto-ACD, with detailed ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our retrieval and KB construction methods.</description>

      <title>GraFPrint: A GNN-Based Approach for Audio Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces GraFPrint, an audio identification framework that leverages the structural learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to create robust audio fingerprints. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph from time-frequency representations and applies max-relative graph convolutions to encode local and global information. The network is trained using a self-supervised contrastive approach, which enhances resilience to ambient distortions by optimizing feature representation. GraFPrint demonstrates superior performance on large-scale datasets at various levels of granularity, proving to be both lightweight and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications with extensive reference databases.</description>

      <title>CleanUMamba: A Compact Mamba Network for Speech Denoising using Channel Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents CleanUMamba, a time-domain neural network architecture designed for real-time causal audio denoising directly applied to raw waveforms. CleanUMamba leverages a U-Net encoder-decoder structure, incorporating the Mamba state-space model in the bottleneck layer. By replacing conventional self-attention and LSTM mechanisms with Mamba, our architecture offers superior denoising performance while maintaining a constant memory footprint, enabling streaming operation. To enhance efficiency, we applied structured channel pruning, achieving an 8X reduction in model size without compromising audio quality. Our model demonstrates strong results in the Interspeech 2020 Deep Noise Suppression challenge. Specifically, CleanUMamba achieves a PESQ score of 2.42 and STOI of 95.1% with only 442K parameters and 468M MACs, matching or outperforming larger models in real-time performance.

      <title>Audio-based Kinship Verification Using Age Domain Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-based kinship verification (AKV) is important in many domains, such as home security monitoring, forensic identification, and social network analysis. A key challenge in the task arises from differences in age across samples from different individuals, which can be interpreted as a domain bias in a cross-domain verification task. To address this issue, we design the notion of an "age-standardised domain" wherein we utilise the optimised CycleGAN-VC3 network to perform age-audio conversion to generate the in-domain audio. The generated audio dataset is employed to extract a range of features, which are then fed into a metric learning architecture to verify kinship. Experiments are conducted on the KAN_AV audio dataset, which contains age and kinship labels. The results demonstrate that the method markedly enhances the accuracy of kinship verification, while also offering novel insights for future kinship verification research.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Speaker Representation for Target-Speaker Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target-speaker speech processing (TS) tasks, such as target-speaker automatic speech recognition (TS-ASR), target speech extraction (TSE), and personal voice activity detection (p-VAD), are important for extracting information about a desired speaker's speech even when it is corrupted by interfering speakers. While most studies have focused on training schemes or system architectures for each specific task, the auxiliary network for embedding target-speaker cues has not been investigated comprehensively in a unified cross-task evaluation. Therefore, this paper aims to address a fundamental question: what is the preferred speaker embedding for TS tasks? To this end, for the TS-ASR, TSE, and p-VAD tasks, we compare pre-trained speaker encoders (i.e., self-supervised or speaker recognition models) that compute speaker embeddings from pre-recorded enrollment speech of the target speaker with ideal speaker embeddings derived directly from the target speaker's identity in the form of a one-hot vector. To further understand the properties of ideal speaker embedding, we optimize it using a gradient-based approach to improve performance on the TS task. Our analysis reveals that speaker verification performance is somewhat unrelated to TS task performances, the one-hot vector outperforms enrollment-based ones, and the optimal embedding depends on the input mixture.</description>

      <title>Diff-SAGe: End-to-End Spatial Audio Generation Using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial audio is a crucial component in creating immersive experiences. Traditional simulation-based approaches to generate spatial audio rely on expertise, have limited scalability, and assume independence between semantic and spatial information. To address these issues, we explore end-to-end spatial audio generation. We introduce and formulate a new task of generating first-order Ambisonics (FOA) given a sound category and sound source spatial location. We propose Diff-SAGe, an end-to-end, flow-based diffusion-transformer model for this task. Diff-SAGe utilizes a complex spectrogram representation for FOA, preserving the phase information crucial for accurate spatial cues. Additionally, a multi-conditional encoder integrates the input conditions into a unified representation, guiding the generation of FOA waveforms from noise. Through extensive evaluations on two datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional simulation-based baselines across both objective and subjective metrics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM Embeddings for Cross Dataset Label Alignment and Zero Shot Music Emotion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for music emotion recognition that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings for label alignment across multiple datasets and zero-shot prediction on novel categories. First, we compute LLM embeddings for emotion labels and apply non-parametric clustering to group similar labels, across multiple datasets containing disjoint labels. We use these cluster centers to map music features (MERT) to the LLM embedding space. To further enhance the model, we introduce an alignment regularization that enables dissociation of MERT embeddings from different clusters. This further enhances the model's ability to better adaptation to unseen datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing zero-shot inference on a new dataset, showcasing its ability to generalize to unseen labels without additional training.</description>

      <title>LLM Gesticulator: Leveraging Large Language Models for Scalable and Controllable Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present LLM Gesticulator, an LLM-based audio-driven co-speech gesture generation framework that synthesizes full-body animations that are rhythmically aligned with the input audio while exhibiting natural movements and editability. Compared to previous work, our model demonstrates substantial scalability. As the size of the backbone LLM model increases, our framework shows proportional improvements in evaluation metrics (a.k.a. scaling law). Our method also exhibits strong controllability where the content, style of the generated gestures can be controlled by text prompt. To the best of our knowledge, LLM gesticulator is the first work that use LLM on the co-speech generation task. Evaluation with existing objective metrics and user studies indicate that our framework outperforms prior works.</description>

      <title>Code Drift: Towards Idempotent Neural Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural codecs have demonstrated strong performance in high-fidelity compression of audio signals at low bitrates. The token-based representations produced by these codecs have proven particularly useful for generative modeling. While much research has focused on improvements in compression ratio and perceptual transparency, recent works have largely overlooked another desirable codec property -- idempotence, the stability of compressed outputs under multiple rounds of encoding. We find that state-of-the-art neural codecs exhibit varied degrees of idempotence, with some degrading audio outputs significantly after as few as three encodings. We investigate possible causes of low idempotence and devise a method for improving idempotence through fine-tuning a codec model. We then examine the effect of idempotence on a simple conditional generative modeling task, and find that increased idempotence can be achieved without negatively impacting downstream modeling performance -- potentially extending the usefulness of neural codecs for practical file compression and iterative generative modeling workflows.</description>

      <title>Character-aware audio-visual subtitling in context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved framework for character-aware audio-visual subtitling in TV shows. Our approach integrates speech recognition, speaker diarisation, and character recognition, utilising both audio and visual cues. This holistic solution addresses what is said, when it's said, and who is speaking, providing a more comprehensive and accurate character-aware subtitling for TV shows. Our approach brings improvements on two fronts: first, we show that audio-visual synchronisation can be used to pick out the talking face amongst others present in a video clip, and assign an identity to the corresponding speech segment. This audio-visual approach improves recognition accuracy and yield over current methods. Second, we show that the speaker of short segments can be determined by using the temporal context of the dialogue within a scene. We propose an approach using local voice embeddings of the audio, and large language model reasoning on the text transcription. This overcomes a limitation of existing methods that they are unable to accurately assign speakers to short temporal segments. We validate the method on a dataset with 12 TV shows, demonstrating superior performance in speaker diarisation and character recognition accuracy compared to existing approaches.

      <title>DMDSpeech: Distilled Diffusion Model Surpassing The Teacher in Zero-shot Speech Synthesis via Direct Metric Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in speech synthesis tasks, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice cloning. However, their iterative denoising processes are inefficient and hinder the application of end-to-end optimization with perceptual metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel method of distilling TTS diffusion models with direct end-to-end evaluation metric optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance. By incorporating Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss and Speaker Verification (SV) loss, our approach optimizes perceptual evaluation metrics, leading to notable improvements in word error rate and speaker similarity. Our experiments show that DMDSpeech consistently surpasses prior state-of-the-art models in both naturalness and speaker similarity while being significantly faster. Moreover, our synthetic speech has a higher level of voice similarity to the prompt than the ground truth in both human evaluation and objective speaker similarity metric. This work highlights the potential of direct metric optimization in speech synthesis, allowing models to better align with human auditory preferences. The audio samples are available at https://dmdspeech.github.io/.</description>

      <title>DARNet: Dual Attention Refinement Network with Spatiotemporal Construction for Auditory Attention Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At a cocktail party, humans exhibit an impressive ability to direct their attention. The auditory attention detection (AAD) approach seeks to identify the attended speaker by analyzing brain signals, such as EEG signals. However, current AAD algorithms overlook the spatial distribution information within EEG signals and lack the ability to capture long-range latent dependencies, limiting the model's ability to decode brain activity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dual attention refinement network with spatiotemporal construction for AAD, named DARNet, which consists of the spatiotemporal construction module, dual attention refinement module, and feature fusion \&amp; classifier module. Specifically, the spatiotemporal construction module aims to construct more expressive spatiotemporal feature representations, by capturing the spatial distribution characteristics of EEG signals. The dual attention refinement module aims to extract different levels of temporal patterns in EEG signals and enhance the model's ability to capture long-range latent dependencies. The feature fusion \&amp; classifier module aims to aggregate temporal patterns and dependencies from different levels and obtain the final classification results. The experimental results indicate that compared to the state-of-the-art models, DARNet achieves an average classification accuracy improvement of 5.9\% for 0.1s, 4.6\% for 1s, and 3.9\% for 2s on the DTU dataset. While maintaining excellent classification performance, DARNet significantly reduces the number of required parameters. Compared to the state-of-the-art models, DARNet reduces the parameter count by 91\%. Code is available at: https://github.com/fchest/DARNet.git.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni2: Towards Open-source GPT-4o with Vision, Speech and Duplex Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11190v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPT-4o, an all-encompassing model, represents a milestone in the development of large multi-modal language models. It can understand visual, auditory, and textual modalities, directly output audio, and support flexible duplex interaction. Models from the open-source community often achieve some functionalities of GPT-4o, such as visual understanding and voice chat. Nevertheless, training a unified model that incorporates all modalities is challenging due to the complexities of multi-modal data, intricate model architectures, and training processes. In this paper, we introduce Mini-Omni2, a visual-audio assistant capable of providing real-time, end-to-end voice responses to visoin and audio queries. By integrating pretrained visual and auditory encoders, Mini-Omni2 maintains performance in individual modalities. We propose a three-stage training process to align modalities, allowing the language model to handle multi-modal inputs and outputs after training on a limited dataset. For interaction, we introduce a command-based interruption mechanism, enabling more flexible interaction with users. To the best of our knowledge, Mini-Omni2 is one of the closest reproductions of GPT-4o, which have similar form of functionality, and we hope it can offer valuable insights for subsequent research.</description>

      <title>The importance of spatial and spectral information in multiple speaker tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-speaker localization and tracking using microphone array recording is of importance in a wide range of applications. One of the challenges with multi-speaker tracking is to associate direction estimates with the correct speaker. Most existing association approaches rely on spatial or spectral information alone, leading to performance degradation when one of these information channels is partially known or missing. This paper studies a joint probability data association (JPDA)-based method that facilitates association based on joint spatial-spectral information. This is achieved by integrating speaker time-frequency (TF) masks, estimated based on spectral information, in the association probabilities calculation. An experimental study that tested the proposed method on recordings from the LOCATA challenge demonstrates the enhanced performance obtained by using joint spatial-spectral information in the association.</description>

Abstract: Recently, symbolic music generation has become a focus of numerous deep learning research. Structure as an important part of music, contributes to improving the quality of music, and an increasing number of works start to study the hierarchical structure. In this study, we delve into the multi-level structures within music from macro-level and micro-level hierarchies. At the macro-level hierarchy, we conduct phrase segmentation algorithm to explore how phrases influence the overall development of music, and at the micro-level hierarchy, we design skeleton notes extraction strategy to explore how skeleton notes within each phrase guide the melody generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel Phrase-level Cross-Attention mechanism to capture the intrinsic relationship between macro-level hierarchy and micro-level hierarchy. Moreover, in response to the current lack of research on Chinese-style music, we construct our Small Tunes Dataset: a substantial collection of MIDI files comprising 10088 Small Tunes, a category of traditional Chinese Folk Songs. This dataset serves as the focus of our study. We generate Small Tunes songs utilizing the extracted skeleton notes as conditions, and experiment results indicate that our proposed model, Small Tunes Transformer, outperforms other state-of-the-art models. Besides, we design three novel objective evaluation metrics to evaluate music from both rhythm and melody dimensions.</description>

      <title>F5-TTS: A Fairytaler that Fakes Fluent and Faithful Speech with Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces F5-TTS, a fully non-autoregressive text-to-speech system based on flow matching with Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Without requiring complex designs such as duration model, text encoder, and phoneme alignment, the text input is simply padded with filler tokens to the same length as input speech, and then the denoising is performed for speech generation, which was originally proved feasible by E2 TTS. However, the original design of E2 TTS makes it hard to follow due to its slow convergence and low robustness. To address these issues, we first model the input with ConvNeXt to refine the text representation, making it easy to align with the speech. We further propose an inference-time Sway Sampling strategy, which significantly improves our model's performance and efficiency. This sampling strategy for flow step can be easily applied to existing flow matching based models without retraining. Our design allows faster training and achieves an inference RTF of 0.15, which is greatly improved compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based TTS models. Trained on a public 100K hours multilingual dataset, our Fairytaler Fakes Fluent and Faithful speech with Flow matching (F5-TTS) exhibits highly natural and expressive zero-shot ability, seamless code-switching capability, and speed control efficiency. Demo samples can be found at https://SWivid.github.io/F5-TTS. We release all code and checkpoints to promote community development.</description>
