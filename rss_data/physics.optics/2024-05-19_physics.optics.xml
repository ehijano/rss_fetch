      <title>Regular, beating and dilogarithmic breathers in biased photorefractive crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of light beams in photovoltaic pyroelectric photorefractive crystals is modelled by a specific generalization of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (GNLSE). We use the variational approximation (VA) to predict the propagation of solitary-wave inputs in the crystal, finding that the VA equations involve the dilogarithm special function. The VA predicts that solitons and breathers exist, and the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion predicts that the solitons are stable solutions. Direct simulations of the underlying GNLSE corroborates the existence of such stable modes. The numerical solutions produce both regular breathers and ones featuring beats (long-period modulations of fast oscillations). In the latter case, the Fourier transform of amplitude oscillations reveals a nearly discrete spectrum characterizing the beats dynamics. Numerical solutions of another type demonstrate spontaneous splitting of the input pulse in two or several secondary ones.</description>

      <title>Single-shot volumetric fluorescence imaging with neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot volumetric fluorescence (SVF) imaging offers a significant advantage over traditional imaging methods that require scanning across multiple axial planes as it can capture biological processes with high temporal resolution across a large field of view. Existing SVF imaging methods often require large, complex point spread functions (PSFs) to meet the multiplexing requirements of compressed sensing, which limits the signal-to-noise ratio, resolution and/or field of view. In this paper, we introduce the QuadraPol PSF combined with neural fields, a novel approach for SVF imaging. This method utilizes a cost-effective custom polarizer at the back focal plane and a polarization camera to detect fluorescence, effectively encoding the 3D scene within a compact PSF without depth ambiguity. Additionally, we propose a reconstruction algorithm based on the neural fields technique that addresses the inaccuracies of phase retrieval methods used to correct imaging system aberrations. This algorithm combines the accuracy of experimental PSFs with the long depth of field of computationally generated retrieved PSFs. QuadraPol PSF, combined with neural fields, significantly reduces the acquisition time of a conventional fluorescence microscope by approximately 20 times and captures a 100 mm$^3$ cubic volume in one shot. We validate the effectiveness of both our hardware and algorithm through all-in-focus imaging of bacterial colonies on sand surfaces and visualization of plant root morphology. Our approach offers a powerful tool for advancing biological research and ecological studies.</description>

      <title>Geometric Phase and Nanoscale Architected Morphology of Reusch Piles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric phase has acquired interest for optical devices such as achromatic phase shifters, spatial light modulators, frequency shifters, and planar lenses for wavefront engineering. Numerical work with Reusch piles with a large number of layers per period suggests that the geometric phase of the reflected/transmitted plane wave may be sensitive to nanoscale morphological differences, and the geometric-phase spectrum could contain signatures of morphological details that depend on the fabrication technique.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-enhanced two photon excited emission from edges of one-dimensional plasmonic hotspots with continuous-wave laser excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional junctions between parallel and closely arranged multiple silver nanowires (NWs) exhibit a large electromagnetic (EM) enhancement factor (FR) owing to both localized and surface plasmon resonances. Such junctions are referred to as one-dimensional (1D) hotspots (HSs). This study found that two-photon excited emissions, such as hyper-Rayleigh, hyper-Raman, and two-photon fluorescence of dye molecules, are generated at the edge of 1D HSs of NW dimers with continuous-wave near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation and propagated through the 1D HSs; however, they were not generated from the centers of 1D HSs. Numerical EM calculations showed that FR of the NIR region for the edges of 1D HSs was larger than that for the centers by approximately 104 times, resulting in the observation of two-photon excited emissions only from the edge of 1D HSs. The analysis of the NW dimer gap distance dependence of FR revealed that the lowest surface plasmon (SP) mode, compressed and localized at the edges of the 1D HSs, was the origin of the large FR in the NIR region. The propagation of two-photon-excited emissions was supported by higher-order coupled SP mode.</description>

      <title>Observation of Noise Suppression during High-Efficiency Wavelength Doubling of Intense Quasi-Monochromatic Laser Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-stable, quasi-monochromatic laser light forms the basis for high-precision interferometric measurements, e.g. for observing gravitational waves and for time keeping with optical clocks. Optical frequency conversion enables access to wavelengths at which optical materials have the lowest absorption and the lowest mechanical loss. Here we report a 25 % reduction in relative intensity noise (of technical origin) when converting 1064 nm to 2128 nm for powers far above parametric oscillation threshold. The new wavelength has high potential for improving gravitational wave detection and other ultra-high-precision experiments as well. Our results provide a better understanding of the dynamics of nonlinear optical processes and have great potential for the stabilisation of laser sources in optical sensing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-enabled non-orthogonal four-output polarization splitter for non-redundant full-Stokes imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging polarimetry plays an essential role in various fields since it imparts rich information that cannot be obtained through mere intensity and spectral measurements. To retrieve full Stokes parameters, at least four sensor pixels are required, each of which projects incident light to a different polarization state in the Stokes space. Conventional full-Stokes division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) cameras realize this function by integrating angled polarizers and retarders on top of image sensors. Due to the inevitable absorption at the polarizers, however, the maximum efficiency of these schemes is limited to 50% in theory. Instead of polarizers, three sets of lossless polarization beam splitters can be used to achieve higher-efficiency polarimetry, however, at the cost of reduced spatial resolution due to the need for six redundant sensor pixels. In this paper, we reveal, for the first time to our knowledge, that low-loss four-output polarization splitting (without filtering) is possible using a single-layer dielectric metasurface. Although these four states are not orthogonal to each other, our metasurface enables simultaneous sorting and focusing onto four sensor pixels with an efficiency exceeding 50\%, which is not feasible by a simple combination of space-optic components. The designed metasurface composed of silicon nanoposts is fabricated to experimentally demonstrate complete retrieval of full Stokes parameters at the near-infrared wavelength range from 1500 to 1600 nm with $-$2.28-dB efficiency. Finally, simple imaging polarimetry is demonstrated using a 3$\times$4 superpixel array.</description>

      <title>Inverse Opal Optical Tamm State for Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of optical Tamm states (OTS) in inverse opal (IO) - based three-dimensional photonic crystal on a flat metal substrate, validated through both numerical simulations and experimental observations. Our fabrication approach for the Tamm inverse opal (Tamm-IO) structure is notably straightforward and does not involve corrosive chemicals. Upon infiltration of non-reactive solvents such as methanol and ethanol into the IO, a noticeable shift of the OTS, consistent with our simulations is observed, and the temporal dynamics of the same have been investigated. The experimentally obtained sensitivity is ~ 110 nm/RIU which is of the same order as the computed value, making the IO OTS to be an attractive sensing tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converting a THz signal into the optical domain is of great interest for THz sensing and spectroscopy. Here intense broadband THz pulses with a central frequency of $\Omega$$_{THz}$ are mixed with an optical pump at $\omega$$_p$ and a signal is observed at a wavelength of $\omega$$_s$ = 2($\omega$$_p$ - $\Delta\omega$$_p$) - $\Omega_{THz}$ with the detuning $\omega$$_p$ - $\Delta\omega$$_p$ being due to pump pulse spectral broadening. The observed THz-FWM signal close to 400 nm is shown to result from a resonantly amplified four-wave mixing in CaF$_2$, BaF$_2$ and MgF$_2$.</description>

      <title>A wavefront rotator with near-zero mean polarization change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A K-mirror is a device that rotates the wavefront of an incident optical field. It has recently gained prominence over Dove prism, another commonly used wavefront rotator, due to the fact that while a K-mirror has several controls for adjusting the internal reflections, a Dove prism is made of a single glass element with no additional control. Thus, one can obtain much lower angular deviations of transmitting wavefronts using a K-mirror than with a Dove prism. However, the accompanying polarization changes in the transmitted field due to rotation persist even in the commercially available K-mirrors. A recent theoretical work [Applied Optics, 61, 8302 (2022)] shows that it is possible to optimize the base angle of a K-mirror for a given refractive index such that the accompanying polarization changes are minimum. In contrast, we show in this article that by optimizing the refractive index it is possible to design a K-mirror at any given base angle and with any given value for the mean polarization change, including near-zero values. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a K-mirror with an order-of-magnitude lower mean polarization change than that of the commercially available K-mirrors. This can have important practical implications for OAM-based applications that require precise wavefront rotation control.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use ab-initio electromagnetic simulations to investigate light absorption by rough surfaces in the context of the formation of laser-induced periodic surface structures. Our approach involves modeling a realistic rough surface using a statistical description of its continuous height distribution via a corresponding correlation function. We study the influence of incident light polarization and various statistical properties of surface roughness, such as root-mean-square height and correlation length, on the distribution of absorbed laser energy. By analyzing light absorption in different layers of the surface selvedge, we elucidate how different features of surface morphology influence the shape of the resulting periodic surface structures. We show that circularly polarized laser pulses are highly sensitive to initial or progressively developing asymmetries in surface roughness.</description>

      <title>Hyper-doping of Silicon for Plasmonics in the Telecommunication Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hyper-doping, a promising approach to introduce a high concentration of impurities into silicon beyond its solid solubility limit, for its potential applications in near-infrared plasmonics. We systematically explore the incorporation of dopants into silicon using ion implantation and pulsed laser melting annealing processes. Reflectance spectra analysis shows an achievable plasma wavelength of around 1.5 $\mu$m for dopant concentrations exceeding 4 at.%. Complex refractive index data for the doped silicon samples are extracted, revealing their potential for near-infrared plasmonic applications. Moreover, we propose a fabrication process that allows for the creation of hyper-doped silicon nanoparticles without the need for additional masking steps. Our research paves the way for designing CMOS-compatible plasmonic nanostructures operating in the telecommunication wavelength range. The study's findings offer significant insights into the utilization of hyper-doped silicon for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design for Waveguide Dispersion with a Differentiable Mode Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design of optical components based on adjoint sensitivity analysis has the potential to address the most challenging photonic engineering problems. However existing inverse design tools based on finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) models are poorly suited for optimizing waveguide modes for adiabatic transformation or perturbative coupling, which lies at the heart of many important photonic devices. Among these, dispersion engineering of optical waveguides is especially challenging in ultrafast and nonlinear optical applications involving broad optical bandwidths and frequency-dependent anisotropic dielectric material response. In this work we develop gradient back-propagation through a general purpose electromagnetic eigenmode solver and use it to demonstrate waveguide dispersion optimization for second harmonic generation with maximized phase-matching bandwidth. This optimization of three design parameters converges in eight steps, reducing the computational cost of optimization by ~100x compared to exhaustive search and identifies new designs for broadband optical frequency doubling of laser sources in the 1.3-1.4 micron wavelength range.Furthermore we demonstrate that the computational cost of gradient back-propagation is independent of the number of parameters, as required for optimization of complex geometries. This technique enables practical inverse design for a broad range of previously intractable photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient photon-pair generation in layer-poled lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photon-pair sources are crucial for scalable photonic quantum systems. Thin-film lithium niobate is a promising platform for on-chip photon-pair generation through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). However, the device implementation faces practical challenges. Periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN), despite enabling flexible quasi-phase matching, suffers from poor fabrication reliability and device repeatability, while conventional modal phase matching (MPM) methods yield limited efficiencies due to inadequate mode overlaps. Here, we introduce a layer-poled lithium niobate (LPLN) nanophotonic waveguide for efficient photon-pair generation. It leverages layer-wise polarity inversion through electrical poling to break spatial symmetry and significantly enhance nonlinear interactions for MPM, achieving a notable normalized second-harmonic generation (SHG) conversion efficiency of 4615% W^{-1}cm^{-2}. Through a cascaded SHG and SPDC process, we demonstrate photon-pair generation with a normalized brightness of 3.1*10^6 Hz nm^{-1} mW^{-2} in a 3.3 mm long LPLN waveguide, surpassing existing on-chip sources under similar operating configurations. Crucially, our LPLN waveguides offer enhanced fabrication reliability and reduced sensitivity to geometric variations and temperature fluctuations compared to PPLN devices. We expect LPLN to become a promising solution for on-chip nonlinear wavelength conversion and non-classical light generation, with immediate applications in quantum communication, networking, and on-chip photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, exciton-polariton microcavity arrays have emerged as a promising semiconductor-based platform for analogue simulations of model Hamiltonians and topological effects. To realize experimentally a variety of Hamiltonians and change their parameters, it is essential to have highly tunable and easily engineerable structures. Here, we demonstrate in-situ tunable, room-temperature polariton condensation in individual states of a one-dimensional topological lattice, by utilizing an open-cavity configuration with an organic polymer layer. Angle-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal the band structure of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, comprised of S-like and P-like bands, along with the appearance of discrete topological edge states with distinct symmetries. Changing the cavity length in combination with vibron-mediated relaxation in the polymer allows us to achieve selective polariton condensation into different states of the band structure, unveiled by nonlinear emission, linewidth narrowing, energy blue-shift and extended macroscopic coherence. Furthermore, we engineer the bandgap and the edge state localization by adjusting the interaction between adjacent lattice sites. Comparison to first-principles calculations showcases the precision of the polariton simulator. These results demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of the platform for the investigation of quantum fluids in complex potential landscapes and topological effects at room temperature.</description>

      <title>XLuminA: An Auto-differentiating Discovery Framework for Super-Resolution Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by human ingenuity and creativity, the discovery of super-resolution techniques, which circumvent the classical diffraction limit of light, represent a leap in optical microscopy. However, the vast space encompassing all possible experimental configurations suggests that some powerful concepts and techniques might have not been discovered yet, and might never be with a human-driven direct design approach. Thus, AI-based exploration techniques could provide enormous benefit, by exploring this space in a fast, unbiased way. We introduce XLuminA, an open-source computational framework developed using JAX, which offers enhanced computational speed enabled by its accelerated linear algebra compiler (XLA), just-in-time compilation, and its seamlessly integrated automatic vectorization, auto-differentiation capabilities and GPU compatibility. Remarkably, XLuminA demonstrates a speed-up of 4 orders of magnitude compared to well-established numerical optimization methods. We showcase XLuminA's potential by re-discovering three foundational experiments in advanced microscopy. Ultimately, XLuminA identified a novel experimental blueprint featuring sub-diffraction imaging capabilities. This work constitutes an important step in AI-driven scientific discovery of new concepts in optics and advanced microscopy.</description>

Abstract: The fascinating realm of non-Hermitian physics with the interplay of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry has been witnessing immense attention in exploring unconventional physics at Exceptional Point (EP) singularities. Particularly, the physics of PT-symmetry, anti-PT (APT)-symmetry, and the emergence of EPs have ignited fervor in photonics. Beyond the conventional relation between EP and PT-symmetric phase transitions, this study delves into hosting higher-order EPs in a specially designed APT-symmetric Fabry-P\'erot-type microcavity. We unveil the captivating physics of the parametric encirclement schemes to explore the branch-point behaviors of EPs up to order three in terms of successive state-flipping, while optimizing the designed cavity under APT-symmetric constraints. The insights from our findings are poised to boost research in optical metamaterials, meeting the demands of APT-symmetry and paving the way for a novel class of photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: The fundamental principle of satellite or node-based positioning involves triangulating the receiver's coordinates through the intersection of spatial distances. Recent advancements in hybrid wireless networks have yielded high-precision positioning at decimetre-level (wavelength-level) (Nature 611, 473-478 (2022)), approaching the resolution limits in free space. Here, we present a three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution positioning paradigm in free space by utilizing a novel kind of topologically structured pulses, toroidal electromagnetic pulses (Nat. Photonics 16(7), 523-528 (2022); Sci. Adv. 10(2), eadl1803 (2024)). Excited by the recent compact generator of toroidal pulses and their sophisticated topological and nonseparable structures, we demonstrate that the space-time nonseparability and skyrmion topology inherent in toroidal pulses can be harnessed to achieve freespace microwave 3D positioning with super-resolution accuracy, reaching the centimeter level, using a single emitting antenna. This work opens up new avenues for exploring the potential applications of topological electromagnetic pulses including but not limited to positioning, imaging, and sensing technologies.</description>
