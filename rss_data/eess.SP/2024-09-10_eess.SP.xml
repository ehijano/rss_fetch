      <title>NapTune: Efficient Model Tuning for Mood Classification using Previous Night's Sleep Measures along with Wearable Time-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep is known to be a key factor in emotional regulation and overall mental health. In this study, we explore the integration of sleep measures from the previous night into wearable-based mood recognition. To this end, we propose NapTune, a novel prompt-tuning framework that utilizes sleep-related measures as additional inputs to a frozen pre-trained wearable time-series encoder by adding and training lightweight prompt parameters to each Transformer layer. Through rigorous empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the inclusion of sleep data using NapTune not only improves mood recognition performance across different wearable time-series namely ECG, PPG, and EDA, but also makes it more sample-efficient. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over the best baselines and unimodal variants. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of adding sleep-related measures on recognizing different moods as well as the influence of individual sleep-related measures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Noise Approximation and Pattern Analysis on Parameterized Component Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise is a vital factor in determining the accuracy of processing the information of the quantum channel. One must consider classical noise effects associated with quantum noise sources for more realistic modelling of quantum channels. A hybrid quantum noise model incorporating both quantum Poisson noise and classical additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) can be interpreted as an infinite mixture of Gaussians with weightage from the Poisson distribution. The entropy measure of this function is difficult to calculate. This research developed how the infinite mixture can be well approximated by a finite mixture distribution depending on the Poisson parametric setting compared to the number of mixture components. The mathematical analysis of the characterization of hybrid quantum noise has been demonstrated based on Gaussian and Poisson parametric analysis. This helps in the pattern analysis of the parametric values of the component distribution, and it also helps in the calculation of hybrid noise entropy to understand hybrid quantum noise better.</description>

      <title>Transformer Based Tissue Classification in Robotic Needle Biopsy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-guided minimally invasive robotic surgery is commonly employed for tasks such as needle biopsies or localized therapies. However, the nonlinear deformation of various tissue types presents difficulties for surgeons in achieving precise needle tip placement, particularly when relying on low-fidelity biopsy imaging systems. In this paper, we introduce a method to classify needle biopsy interventions and identify tissue types based on a comprehensive needle-tissue contact model that incorporates both position and force parameters. We trained a transformer model using a comprehensive dataset collected from a formerly developed robotics platform, which consists of synthetic and porcine tissue from various locations (liver, kidney, heart, belly, hock) marked with interaction phases (pre-puncture, puncture, post-puncture, neutral). This model achieves a significant classification accuracy of 0.93. Our demonstrated method can assist surgeons in identifying transitions to different tissues, aiding surgeons with tissue awareness.</description>

      <title>SPIRIT: Low Power Seizure Prediction using Unsupervised Online-Learning and Zoom Analog Frontends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early prediction of seizures and timely interventions are vital for improving patients' quality of life. While seizure prediction has been shown in software-based implementations, to enable timely warnings of upcoming seizures, prediction must be done on an edge device to reduce latency. Ideally, such devices must also be low-power and track long-term drifts to minimize maintenance from the user. This work presents SPIRIT: Stochastic-gradient-descent-based Predictor with Integrated Retraining and In situ accuracy Tuning. SPIRIT is a complete system-on-a-chip (SoC) integrating an unsupervised online-learning seizure prediction classifier with eight 14.4 uW, 0.057 mm2, 90.5 dB dynamic range, Zoom Analog Frontends. SPIRIT achieves, on average, 97.5%/96.2% sensitivity/specificity respectively, predicting seizures an average of 8.4 minutes before they occur. Through its online learning algorithm, prediction accuracy improves by up to 15%, and prediction times extend by up to 7x, without any external intervention. Its classifier consumes 17.2 uW and occupies 0.14 mm2, the lowest reported for a prediction classifier by &gt;134x in power and &gt;5x in area. SPIRIT is also at least 5.6x more energy efficient than the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Data driven synthetic wavefront generation for boundary layer data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disturbances such as atmospheric turbulence and aero-optic effects lead to wavefront aberrations, which degrade performance in imaging and laser propagation applications. Adaptive optics (AO) provide a method to mitigate these effects by pre-compensating the wavefront before propagation. However, development and testing of AO systems requires wavefront aberration data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. Simulation methods can be used to generate such data less expensively. For atmospheric turbulence, the Kolmogorov-Taylor model provides a well-defined power spectrum that can be combined with the well-known angular spectrum method to generate synthetic phase screens. However, as aero-optics cannot be similarly generalized, this process cannot be applied to aero-optically relevant phenomena. In this paper, we introduce ReVAR (Re-Whitened Vector Auto-Regression), a novel algorithm for data-driven aero-optic phase screen generation. ReVAR trains on an input time-series of spatially and temporally correlated wavefront images from experiment and then generates synthetic data that captures the statistics present in the experimental data. The first training step of ReVAR distills the input images to a set of prediction weights and residuals. A further step we call re-whitening uses a spatial principal component analysis (PCA) to whiten these residuals. ReVAR then uses a white noise generator and inverts the previous transformation to construct synthetic time-series of data. This algorithm is computationally efficient, able to generate arbitrarily long synthetic time-series, and produces high-quality results when tested on turbulent boundary layer (TBL) data measured from a wind tunnel experiment. Using measured data for training, the temporal power spectral density (TPSD) of data generated using ReVAR closely matches the TPSD of the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Joint Antenna Selection and Precoding Methods in Multi-user Massive MISO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a performance analysis of two distinct techniques for antenna selection and precoding in downlink multi-user massive multiple-input single-output systems with limited dynamic range power amplifiers. Both techniques are derived from the original formulation of the regularized-zero forcing precoder, designed as the solution to minimizing a regularized distortion. Based on this, the first technique, called the $\ell_1$-norm precoder, adopts an $\ell_1$-norm regularization term to encourage sparse solutions, thereby enabling antenna selection. The second technique, termed the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder, involves post-processing the precoder solution obtained from the first method by applying an entry-wise thresholding operation. This work conducts a precise performance analysis to compare these two techniques. The analysis leverages the Gaussian min-max theorem which is effective for examining the asymptotic behavior of optimization problems without explicit solutions. While the analysis of the $\ell_1$-norm precoder follows the conventional Gaussian min-max theorem framework, understanding the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder is more complex due to the non-linear behavior introduced by the thresholding operation. To address this complexity, we develop a novel Gaussian min-max theorem tailored to these scenarios. We provide precise asymptotic behavior analysis of the precoders, focusing on metrics such as received signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and bit error rate. Our analysis demonstrates that the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder can offer superior performance when the threshold parameter is carefully selected. Simulations confirm that the asymptotic results are accurate for systems equipped with hundreds of antennas at the base station, serving dozens of user terminals.</description>

      <title>Time-Distributed Feature Learning for Internet of Things Network Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based network traffic classification (NTC) techniques, including conventional and class-of-service (CoS) classifiers, are a popular tool that aids in the quality of service (QoS) and radio resource management for the Internet of Things (IoT) network. Holistic temporal features consist of inter-, intra-, and pseudo-temporal features within packets, between packets, and among flows, providing the maximum information on network services without depending on defined classes in a problem. Conventional spatio-temporal features in the current solutions extract only space and time information between packets and flows, ignoring the information within packets and flow for IoT traffic. Therefore, we propose a new, efficient, holistic feature extraction method for deep-learning-based NTC using time-distributed feature learning to maximize the accuracy of the NTC. We apply a time-distributed wrapper on deep-learning layers to help extract pseudo-temporal features and spatio-temporal features. Pseudo-temporal features are mathematically complex to explain since, in deep learning, a black box extracts them. However, the features are temporal because of the time-distributed wrapper; therefore, we call them pseudo-temporal features. Since our method is efficient in learning holistic-temporal features, we can extend our method to both conventional and CoS NTC. Our solution proves that pseudo-temporal and spatial-temporal features can significantly improve the robustness and performance of any NTC. We analyze the solution theoretically and experimentally on different real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the holistic-temporal time-distributed feature learning method, on average, is 13.5% more accurate than the state-of-the-art conventional and CoS classifiers.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Trace Norm Minimization for Tensor Tucker Completion: A Direct Multilinear Rank Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05139v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To efficiently express tensor data using the Tucker format, a critical task is to minimize the multilinear rank such that the model would not be over-flexible and lead to overfitting. Due to the lack of rank minimization tools in tensor, existing works connect Tucker multilinear rank minimization to trace norm minimization of matrices unfolded from the tensor data. While these formulations try to exploit the common aim of identifying the low-dimensional structure of the tensor and matrix, this paper reveals that existing trace norm-based formulations in Tucker completion are inefficient in multilinear rank minimization. We further propose a new interpretation of Tucker format such that trace norm minimization is applied to the factor matrices of the equivalent representation, rather than some matrices unfolded from tensor data. Based on the newly established problem formulation, a fixed point iteration algorithm is proposed, and its convergence is proved. Numerical results are presented to show that the proposed algorithm exhibits significant improved performance in terms of multilinear rank learning and consequently tensor signal recovery accuracy, compared to existing trace norm based Tucker completion methods.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Geometric Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalization capabilities of geometric graph neural networks (GNNs). We consider GNNs over a geometric graph constructed from a finite set of randomly sampled points over an embedded manifold with topological information captured. We prove a generalization gap between the optimal empirical risk and the optimal statistical risk of this GNN, which decreases with the number of sampled points from the manifold and increases with the dimension of the underlying manifold. This generalization gap ensures that the GNN trained on a graph on a set of sampled points can be utilized to process other unseen graphs constructed from the same underlying manifold. The most important observation is that the generalization capability can be realized with one large graph instead of being limited to the size of the graph as in previous results. The generalization gap is derived based on the non-asymptotic convergence result of a GNN on the sampled graph to the underlying manifold neural networks (MNNs). We verify this theoretical result with experiments on both Arxiv dataset and Cora dataset.</description>

      <title>A new method to derive the calculation formula of antenna total isotropic sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the OTA test of the antenna spatial performance of communication equipment,the total radiated power TRP and the total isotropic sensitivity TIS are two important characterization parameters,representing the overall transmission and reception performance of the antenna in space.In order to gain a deeper understanding of the physical meaning of these two parameters and the calculation method of TIS,this paper proposes a new method for deriving the TIS calculation formula.This method uses the reciprocity principle of the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna.By comparing the transmitting process,two corresponding receiving antenna parameters are newly defined in the receiving process analysis.Combining the relationship between the antenna pattern and the receiving intensity,the relationship formula between TIS and equivalent isotropic sensitivity EIS is obtained after a simple deduction.This formula is consistent with the calculation formula given in the reference,but the derivation method in the reference is to use the ideal omnidirectional antenna as a reference,calculate the received power at the receiver input,and combine factors such as the actual antenna gain to derive the TIS calculation formula;the method proposed in this paper is to first derive the expression of the receiving directivity coefficient by definition,introduce the receiving strength parameter,calculate the full-space receiving power at the antenna,and derive the TIS calculation formula.In comparison,the derivation process in this paper calculates the received power from the input end of the receiving antenna,so there is no need to consider the efficiency of the antenna itself.The received power calculation starts directly from the receiving intensity.The entire derivation process is intuitive and easy to understand,avoiding complex concepts and formulas.</description>

      <title>Exact equality of the MSEs for two types of nonlinear adaptive systems: Saturation and dead-zone types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive signal processing systems, commonly utilized in applications such as active noise control and acoustic echo cancellation, often encompass nonlinearities due to hardware components such as loudspeakers, microphones, and amplifiers. Examining the impact of these nonlinearities on the overall performance of adaptive systems is critically important. In this study, we employ a statistical-mechanical method to investigate the behaviors of adaptive systems, each containing an unknown system with a nonlinearity in its output. We specifically address two types of nonlinearity: saturation and dead-zone types. We analyze both the dynamic and steady-state behaviors of these systems under the effect of such nonlinearities. Our findings indicate that when the saturation value is equal to the dead-zone width, the mean square errors (MSEs) in steady states are identical for both nonlinearity types. Furthermore, we derive a self-consistent equation to obtain the saturation value and dead-zone width that maximize the steady-state MSE. We theoretically clarify that these values depend on neither the step size nor the variance of background noise.</description>

      <title>Practicality meets precision: Wearable vest with integrated multi-channel PCG sensors for effective coronary artery disease pre-screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide is cardiovascular disease (CVD), with coronary artery disease (CAD) being the largest sub-category. Unfortunately, myocardial infarction or stroke can manifest as the first symptom of CAD, underscoring the crucial importance of early disease detection. Hence, there is a global need for a cost-effective, non-invasive, reliable, and easy-to-use system to pre-screen CAD. Previous studies have explored weak murmurs arising from CAD for classification using phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. However, these studies often involve tedious and inconvenient data collection methods, requiring precise subject preparation and environmental conditions. This study proposes using a novel data acquisition system (DAQS) designed for simplicity and convenience. The DAQS incorporates multi-channel PCG sensors into a wearable vest. The entire signal acquisition process can be completed in under two minutes, from fitting the vest to recording signals and removing it, requiring no specialist training. This exemplifies the potential for mass screening, which is impractical with current state-of-the-art protocols. Seven PCG signals are acquired, six from the chest and one from the subject's back, marking a novel approach. Our classification approach, which utilizes linear-frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) as features and employs a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between normal and CAD-affected heartbeats, outperformed alternative low-computational methods suitable for portable applications. Utilizing feature-level fusion, multiple channels are combined, and the optimal combination yields the highest subject-level accuracy and F1-score of 80.44% and 81.00%, respectively, representing a 7% improvement over the best-performing single channel. The proposed system's performance metrics have been demonstrated to be clinically significant.</description>

      <title>Transferable Selective Virtual Sensing Active Noise Control Technique Based on Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual sensing (VS) technology enables active noise control (ANC) systems to attenuate noise at virtual locations distant from the physical error microphones. Appropriate auxiliary filters (AF) can significantly enhance the effectiveness of VS approaches. The selection of appropriate AF for various types of noise can be automatically achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, training the CNN model for different ANC systems is often labour-intensive and time-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method, Transferable Selective VS, by integrating metric-learning technology into CNN-based VS approaches. The Transferable Selective VS method allows a pre-trained CNN to be applied directly to new ANC systems without requiring retraining, and it can handle unseen noise types. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in attenuating sudden-varying broadband noises and real-world noises.</description>

      <title>ECG Biometric Authentication Using Self-Supervised Learning for IoT Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices are gaining ground for continuous physiological data acquisition and health monitoring. These physiological signals can be used for security applications to achieve continuous authentication and user convenience due to passive data acquisition. This paper investigates an electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric user authentication system using features derived from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and self-supervised contrastive learning. Contrastive learning enables us to use large unlabeled datasets to train the model and establish its generalizability. We propose approaches enabling the CNN encoder to extract appropriate features that distinguish the user from other subjects. When evaluated using the PTB ECG database with 290 subjects, the proposed technique achieved an authentication accuracy of 99.15%. To test its generalizability, we applied the model to two new datasets, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the ECG-ID Database, achieving over 98.5% accuracy without any modifications. Furthermore, we show that repeating the authentication step three times can increase accuracy to nearly 100% for both PTBDB and ECGIDDB. This paper also presents model optimizations for embedded device deployment, which makes the system more relevant to real-world scenarios. To deploy our model in IoT edge sensors, we optimized the model complexity by applying quantization and pruning. The optimized model achieves 98.67% accuracy on PTBDB, with 0.48% accuracy loss and 62.6% CPU cycles compared to the unoptimized model. An accuracy-vs-time-complexity tradeoff analysis is performed, and results are presented for different optimization levels.</description>

      <title>Urban traffic analysis and forecasting through shared Koopman eigenmodes</title>

Abstract: Predicting traffic flow in data-scarce cities is challenging due to limited historical data. To address this, we leverage transfer learning by identifying periodic patterns common to data-rich cities using a customized variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD): constrained Hankelized DMD (TrHDMD). This method uncovers common eigenmodes (urban heartbeats) in traffic patterns and transfers them to data-scarce cities, significantly enhancing prediction performance. TrHDMD reduces the need for extensive training datasets by utilizing prior knowledge from other cities. By applying Koopman operator theory to multi-city loop detector data, we identify stable, interpretable, and time-invariant traffic modes. Injecting ``urban heartbeats'' into forecasting tasks improves prediction accuracy and has the potential to enhance traffic management strategies for cities with varying data infrastructures. Our work introduces cross-city knowledge transfer via shared Koopman eigenmodes, offering actionable insights and reliable forecasts for data-scarce urban environments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Acoustics of the Chinese Transverse Flute (dizi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the acoustical characteristics of the Chinese transverse flute, the dizi, employing input impedance measurements, modeling and analysis. The input impedances for various fingerings of a bangdi in the key of F, a particular type of the dizi, are measured and compared to models using both the transfer matrix method and the Transfer Matrix Method with external Interaction (TMMI). In order to get more accurate modeling results, we provide specific transfer matrices for the unique components of the dizi, such as back end-holes, membrane hole and upstream branch. The matching volume length correction for holes drilled in a thick wall is also derived. Comparative analysis of modeling and measurement data validates the improved accuracy of TMMI, confirming the influence of radiated sound from closely spaced toneholes.</description>

      <title>Fast Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Videos Feature Extraction without Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired deep predictive coding networks (DPCNs) effectively model and capture video features through a bi-directional information flow, even without labels. They are based on an overcomplete description of video scenes, and one of the bottlenecks has been the lack of effective sparsification techniques to find discriminative and robust dictionaries. FISTA has been the best alternative. This paper proposes a DPCN with a fast inference of internal model variables (states and causes) that achieves high sparsity and accuracy of feature clustering. The proposed unsupervised learning procedure, inspired by adaptive dynamic programming with a majorization-minimization framework, and its convergence are rigorously analyzed. Experiments in the data sets CIFAR-10, Super Mario Bros video game, and Coil-100 validate the approach, which outperforms previous versions of DPCNs on learning rate, sparsity ratio, and feature clustering accuracy. Because of DCPN's solid foundation and explainability, this advance opens the door for general applications in object recognition in video without labels.</description>

      <title>Physics-augmented Deep Learning with Adversarial Domain Adaptation: Applications to STM Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image denoising is a critical task in various scientific fields such as medical imaging and material characterization, where the accurate recovery of underlying structures from noisy data is essential. Although supervised denoising techniques have achieved significant advancements, they typically require large datasets of paired clean-noisy images for training. Unsupervised methods, while not reliant on paired data, typically necessitate a set of unpaired clean images for training, which are not always accessible. In this paper, we propose a physics-augmented deep learning with adversarial domain adaption (PDA-Net) framework for unsupervised image denoising, with applications to denoise real-world scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. Our PDA-Net leverages the underlying physics to simulate and envision the ground truth for denoised STM images. Additionally, built upon Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we incorporate a cycle-consistency module and a domain adversarial module into our PDA-Net to address the challenge of lacking paired training data and achieve information transfer between the simulated and real experimental domains. Finally, we propose to implement feature alignment and weight-sharing techniques to fully exploit the similarity between simulated and real experimental images, thereby enhancing the denoising performance in both the simulation and experimental domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PDA-Net successfully enhances the quality of STM images, offering promising applications to enhance scientific discovery and accelerate experimental quantum material research.</description>

      <title>Imputation of Time-varying Edge Flows in Graphs by Multilinear Kernel Regression and Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the recently developed framework of multilinear kernel regression and imputation via manifold learning (MultiL-KRIM) to impute time-varying edge flows in a graph. MultiL-KRIM uses simplicial-complex arguments and Hodge Laplacians to incorporate the graph topology, and exploits manifold-learning arguments to identify latent geometries within features which are modeled as a point-cloud around a smooth manifold embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Following the concept of tangent spaces to smooth manifolds, linear approximating patches are used to add a collaborative-filtering flavor to the point-cloud approximations. Together with matrix factorizations, MultiL-KRIM effects dimensionality reduction, and enables efficient computations, without any training data or additional information. Numerical tests on real-network time-varying edge flows demonstrate noticeable improvements of MultiL-KRIM over several state-of-the-art schemes.</description>

      <title>IndicVoices-R: Unlocking a Massive Multilingual Multi-speaker Speech Corpus for Scaling Indian TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis show that large-scale models trained with extensive web data produce highly natural-sounding output. However, such data is scarce for Indian languages due to the lack of high-quality, manually subtitled data on platforms like LibriVox or YouTube. To address this gap, we enhance existing large-scale ASR datasets containing natural conversations collected in low-quality environments to generate high-quality TTS training data. Our pipeline leverages the cross-lingual generalization of denoising and speech enhancement models trained on English and applied to Indian languages. This results in IndicVoices-R (IV-R), the largest multilingual Indian TTS dataset derived from an ASR dataset, with 1,704 hours of high-quality speech from 10,496 speakers across 22 Indian languages. IV-R matches the quality of gold-standard TTS datasets like LJSpeech, LibriTTS, and IndicTTS. We also introduce the IV-R Benchmark, the first to assess zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot speaker generalization capabilities of TTS models on Indian voices, ensuring diversity in age, gender, and style. We demonstrate that fine-tuning an English pre-trained model on a combined dataset of high-quality IndicTTS and our IV-R dataset results in better zero-shot speaker generalization compared to fine-tuning on the IndicTTS dataset alone. Further, our evaluation reveals limited zero-shot generalization for Indian voices in TTS models trained on prior datasets, which we improve by fine-tuning the model on our data containing diverse set of speakers across language families. We open-source all data and code, releasing the first TTS model for all 22 official Indian languages.</description>

      <title>OTFS-MDMA: An Elastic Multi-Domain Resource Utilization Mechanism for High Mobility Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By harnessing the delay-Doppler (DD) resource domain, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) substantially improves the communication performance under high-mobility scenarios by maintaining quasi-time-invariant channel characteristics. However, conventional multiple access (MA) techniques fail to efficiently support OTFS in the face of diverse communication requirements. Recently, multi-dimensional MA (MDMA) has emerged as a flexible channel access technique by elastically exploiting multi-domain resources for tailored service provision. Therefore, we conceive an elastic multi-domain resource utilization mechanism for a novel multi-user OTFS-MDMA system by leveraging user-specific channel characteristics across the DD, power, and spatial resource domains. Specifically, we divide all DD resource bins into separate subregions called DD resource slots (RSs), each of which supports a fraction of users, thus reducing the multi-user interference. Then, the most suitable MA, including orthogonal, non-orthogonal, or spatial division MA (OMA/ NOMA/ SDMA), will be selected with each RS based on the interference levels in the power and spatial domains, thus enhancing the spectrum efficiency. Then, we jointly optimize the user assignment, access scheme selection, and power allocation in all DD RSs to maximize the weighted sum-rate subject to their minimum rate and various practical constraints. Since this results in a non-convex problem, we develop a dynamic programming and monotonic optimization (DPMO) method to find the globally optimal solution in the special case of disregarding rate constraints. Subsequently, we apply a low-complexity algorithm to find sub-optimal solutions in general cases.</description>

      <title>A Novel Finite Fractional Fourier Transform and its Quantum Circuit Implementation on Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new number theoretic definition of discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) . In this approach the DFrFT is defined as the $N \times N$ dimensional unitary representation of the generator of the arithmetic rotational group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$, which is the finite set of $\bmod N$ integer, $2\times 2$ matrices acting on the points of the discrete toroidal phase space lattice $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$, preserving the euclidean distance $\bmod N$.
  We construct explicitly, using techniques of the Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM), the $p^n$ dimensional unitary matrix representation of the group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}]$ and especially we work out in detail the one which corresponds to the generator. This is our definition of the arithmetic fractional Fourier transform (AFrFT).
  Following this definition, we proceed to the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the AFrFT, on sets of $n$ $p$-dimensional qudits with $p$ a prime integer, by introducing novel quantum subcircuits for diagonal operators with quadratic phases as well as new quantum subcircuits for multipliers by a constant. The quantum subcircuits that we introduce provide a set capable to construct quantum circuits for any element of a more general group, the group of Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT), $SL_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ of the toroidal phase space lattice. As a byproduct, extensions of the diagonal and multiplier quantum circuits for both the qudit and qubit case are given, which are useful alone in various applications. Also, we analyze the depth, width and gate complexity of the efficient AFrFT quantum circuit and we estimate its gate complexity which is of the order $O(n^2)$, its depth which is of the order $O(n)$ with depth $n$, while at the same time it has a structure permitting local interactions between the qudits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.07457v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present strip-map mode spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging with the focus on Doppler centroid frequency estimation. The non-zero Doppler centroid frequency is the result of non-zero squint angle which if it is not compensated it can de-focus the image. We present an efficient method based on the entropy of the reconstructed image to estimate the fractional part of the Doppler centroid frequency. Furthermore, we discuss the speckle noise, which degrades the quality of the reconstructed images considerably, and attempt to alleviate its effect efficiently. Following the implementation of the speckle noise reduction algorithm, a significant improvement in the quality of the reconstructed images is achieved.
  Finally, we utilize the experimental data gathered from the RADARSAT-1 satellite of Vancouver Canada to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Iterative Sparsified MMSE Turbo Equalization for OTFS Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has drawn much attention to reliable communications in high-mobility scenarios. This paper proposes a doubly-iterative sparsified minimum mean square error (DI-S-MMSE) turbo equalizer, which iteratively exchanges the extrinsic information between a soft-input-soft-input (SISO) MMSE estimator and a SISO decoder. Our proposed equalizer does not suffer from short loops and approaches the performance of the near-optimal symbol-wise maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. To exploit the inherent sparsity of OTFS system, we resort to graph theory to investigate the sparsity pattern of the channel matrix, and propose two sparsification guidelines to reduce the complexity of calculating the matrix inverse at the MMSE estimator. Then, we apply two iterative algorithms to MMSE estimation, i.e., the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) and Factorized Sparse Approximate Inverse (FSPAI) algorithms. The former is used at the initial turbo iteration, whose global convergence is proven in our equalizer, while the latter is used at the subsequent turbo iterations with the help of our proposed guidelines. Simulation results demonstrate that our equalizer has a linear order of complexity while the performance loss incurred by the sparsification is only 0.2 dB at $10^{-4}$ bit error rate. Simulation codes are available to reproduce the results presented in this paper: https://github.com/Alga53/DISMMSE-Turbo-Equalizer-for-OTFS.</description>

      <title>Input Distribution Optimization in OFDM Dual-Function Radar-Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely adopted in dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, where radar and communications are performed simultaneously with a common signal. However, with random communication symbols (CS) in DFRC, the transmit signal has a random ambiguity function that affects the radar's range-velocity estimation performance, whose influence is remained uncovered. Hence, this paper focuses on minimizing the outlier probability (OP) -- the probability of incorrectly estimating a target's range-velocity bin -- in OFDM DFRC w.r.t the CS probability distribution (i.e., the \emph{input distribution}). Conditioned on the CSs, the OP only depends on the CS magnitudes. Hence, we consider the following two schemes for the above optimization: CSs with (1) constant magnitude (phase shift keying input), and (2) random magnitude (Gaussian input). For (1), the problem reduces to the familiar power allocation design across OFDM's subcarriers and symbols, with uniform power allocation across subcarriers and a \emph{windowed} power allocation across symbols being near-optimal. For (2), the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution at each subcarrier is optimized, with an additional communication constraint to avoid the zero-variance solution where no CSs are carried. We observe that subcarriers with strong communication channels feature strong variance (i.e., favour communications) while the others are characterized by a strong mean (favouring radar). However, the overall power allocation (i.e., the sum of mean and variance) across the OFDM subcarriers and symbols is similar to (1). Simulations show that CSs with random magnitudes degrade the sensing performance, but can be compensated significantly with the proposed input distribution optimization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gaussian Process Classification-based Physical-Layer Authentication with Configurable Fingerprints for 6G-Enabled IoT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The future 6G-enabled IoT will facilitate seamless global connectivity among ubiquitous wireless devices, but this advancement also introduces heightened security risks such as spoofing attacks. Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) has emerged as a promising, inherently secure, and energy-efficient technique for authenticating IoT terminals. However, applying state-of-the-art PLA schemes directly to 6G-enabled IoT faces two primary challenges: inaccurate channel fingerprints and inefficient utilization of prior fingerprint information. To tackle these challenges, we leverage Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) to enhance fingerprint accuracy. Additionally, we integrate active learning and Gaussian Processes (GPs) to propose an Efficient Gaussian Process Classification (EGPC)-based PLA scheme, aiming for reliable and lightweight authentication. Following Bayes' theorem, we model configurable fingerprints using GPs and employ the Expectation Propagation (EP) method to identify unknown fingerprints. Given the difficulty of obtaining sufficient labeled fingerprint samples to train PLA models, we propose three fingerprint selection algorithms. These algorithms select unlabeled fingerprints whose identities are then queried to upper-layer authentication mechanisms. Among these methods, the optimal algorithm reduces the required number of training fingerprints through importance sampling and eliminates the need for PLA model retraining via joint distribution calculation. The simulations conducted on synthetic datasets demonstrate that the IRS-assisted PLA framework reduces the authentication error rate by 98.69% compared to the non-IRS-based approach. Furthermore, our proposed fingerprint selection algorithms achieve the reduction in the authentication error rate of up to 86.93% compared to baseline active learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Maximum Eigenvalue Detection based Spectrum Sensing in RIS-aided System with Correlated Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust spectrum sensing is crucial for facilitating opportunistic spectrum utilization for secondary users (SU) in the absense of primary users (PU). However, propagation environment factors such as multi-path fading, shadowing, and lack of line of sight (LoS) often adversely affect detection performance. To deal with these issues, this paper focuses on utilizing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to improve spectrum sensing in the scenario wherein both the multi-path fading and noise are correlated. In particular, to leverage the spatially correlated fading, we propose to use maximum eigenvalue detection (MED) for spectrum sensing. We first derive exact distributions of test statistics, i.e., the largest eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix, observed under the null and signal present hypothesis. Next, utilizing these results, we present the exact closed-form expressions for the false alarm and detection probabilities. In addition, we also optimally configure the phase shift matrix of RIS such that the mean of the test statistics is maximized, thus improving the detection performance. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that the MED's receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve improves with increased RIS elements, SNR, and the utilization of statistically optimal configured RIS.</description>

      <title>Process-and-Forward: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Over Cooperative Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) schemes for image transmission over cooperative relay channels. The relay either amplifies-and-forwards its received signal, called DeepJSCC-AF, or leverages neural networks to extract relevant features from its received signal, called DeepJSCC-PF (Process-and-Forward). We consider both half- and full-duplex relays, and propose a novel transformer-based model at the relay. For a half-duplex relay, it is shown that the proposed scheme learns to generate correlated signals at the relay and source to obtain beamforming gains. In the full-duplex case, we introduce a novel block-based transmission strategy, in which the source transmits in blocks, and the relay updates its knowledge about the input signal after each block and generates its own signal. To enhance practicality, a single transformer-based model is used at the relay at each block, together with an adaptive transmission module, which allows the model to seamlessly adapt to different channel qualities and the transmission powers}. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of DeepJSCC-PF compared to the state-of-the-art BPG image compression algorithm operating at the maximum achievable rate of conventional decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward protocols, in both half- and full-duplex relay scenarios over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.</description>

      <title>Distributed Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for Latency Minimization in Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has attracted substantial interests in latency-aware task offloading of mobile edge computing (MEC)-namely, minimizing service latency. Additionally, the use of MEC systems poses an additional problem arising from limited battery resources of MDs. This paper tackles the pressing challenge of latency-aware distributed task offloading optimization, where user association (UA), resource allocation (RA), full-task offloading, and battery of mobile devices (MDs) are jointly considered. In existing studies, joint optimization of overall task offloading and UA is seldom considered due to the complexity of combinatorial optimization problems, and in cases where it is considered, linear objective functions such as power consumption are adopted. Revolutionizing the realm of MEC, our objective includes all major components contributing to users' quality of experience, including latency and energy consumption. To achieve this, we first formulate an NP-hard combinatorial problem, where the objective function comprises three elements: communication latency, computation latency, and battery usage. We derive a closed-form RA solution of the problem; next, we provide a distributed pricing-based UA solution. We simulate the proposed algorithm for various resource-intensive tasks. Our numerical results show that the proposed method Pareto-dominates baseline methods. More specifically, the results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform baseline methods by 1.62 times shorter latency with 41.2% less energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Outlier Hypothesis Testing for Continuous Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In outlier hypothesis testing, one aims to detect outlying sequences among a given set of sequences, where most sequences are generated i.i.d. from a nominal distribution while outlying sequences (outliers) are generated i.i.d. from a different anomalous distribution. Most existing studies focus on discrete-valued sequences, where each data sample takes values in a finite set. To account for practical scenarios where data sequences usually take real values, we study outlier hypothesis testing for continuous sequences when both the nominal and anomalous distributions are \emph{unknown}. Specifically, we propose distribution free tests and prove that the probabilities of misclassification error, false reject and false alarm decay exponentially fast for three different test designs: fixed-length test, sequential test, and two-phase test. In a fixed-length test, one fixes the sample size of each observed sequence; in a sequential test, one takes a sample sequentially from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision can be made; in a two-phase test, one adapts the sample size from two different fixed values. Remarkably, the two-phase test achieves a good balance between test design complexity and theoretical performance. We first consider the case of at most one outlier, and then generalize our results to the case with multiple outliers where the number of outliers is unknown.</description>

      <title>Feature Characterization for Profile Surface Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06381v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional field parameters for surface measurement use all data points, while feature characterization focuses on subsets extracted by watershed segmentation. This approach enables the extraction of specific features that are potentially responsible for the function of the surface or are a direct reflection of the manufacturing process, allowing for a more accurate assessment of both aspects. Feature characterization with the underlying watershed segmentation for areal surface topographies has been standardized for over a decade and is well established in industry and research. In contrast, feature characterization for surface profiles has been standardized recently, and the corresponding standard for watershed segmentation is planned to be published in the near future. Since the standards do not provide guidelines for implementation, this paper presents an unambiguous algorithm of the watershed segmentation and the feature characterization for surface profiles. This framework provides the basis for future work, mainly investigating the relationship between feature parameters based on feature characterization and the function of the surface or manufacturing process. For this purpose, recommendations for the configuration and extensions of the toolbox can also be developed, which could find their way into the ISO standards.</description>

      <title>Classification of Heart Sounds Using Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Network and LSTM-CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Wireless Symbol Detection via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in tackling challenging tasks in wireless systems, especially when an accurate wireless model is not available. However, when available data is limited, traditional DNNs often yield subpar results due to underfitting. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) exemplified by GPT-3, have remarkably showcased their capabilities across a broad range of natural language processing tasks. But whether and how LLMs can benefit challenging non-language tasks in wireless systems is unexplored. In this work, we propose to leverage the in-context learning ability (a.k.a. prompting) of LLMs to solve wireless tasks in the low data regime without any training or fine-tuning, unlike DNNs which require training. We further demonstrate that the performance of LLMs varies significantly when employed with different prompt templates. To solve this issue, we employ the latest LLM calibration methods. Our results reveal that using LLMs via ICL methods generally outperforms traditional DNNs on the symbol demodulation task and yields highly confident predictions when coupled with calibration techniques.</description>

      <title>Target Detection in Sea Clutter with Application to Spaceborne SAR Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the challenging task of target detection in sea clutter is addressed. We analyze the statistical properties of the signals which have been received from the scene and based on that, we model the amplitude of the signals that have been reflected from the sea clutter according to several well-known probability distributions. Next, by exploiting the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence metric as a goodness-of-fit test, we will demonstrate that among the proposed probability distributions, the Weibull distribution can model the statistical properties of the sea clutter with higher accuracy. Subsequently, we utilize the aforementioned information to design an adaptive threshold based on the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm to detect the energy of the targets which have been buried in the sea clutter. Thorough analysis of the experimental data gathered from the Canadian RADARSAT-1 satellite demonstrates the overall effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Optical Integrated Sensing and Communication with Light-Emitting Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new optical integrated sensing and communication (O-ISAC) framework tailored for cost-effective Light-Emitting Diode (LED) for enhanced Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Unlike prior research on ISAC, which predominantly focused on radio frequency (RF) band, O-ISAC capitalizes on the inherent advantages of the optical spectrum, including the ultra-wide license-free bandwidth, immunity to RF interference, and energy efficiency -- attributes crucial for IoT communications. The communication and sensing in our O-ISAC system unfold in two phases: directionless O-ISAC and directional O-ISAC. In the first phase, distributed optical access points emit non-directional light for communication and leverage small-aperture imaging principles for sensing. In the second phase, we put forth the concept of optical beamforming, using collimating lenses to concentrate light, resulting in substantial performance enhancements in both communication and sensing. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and impressive performance of O-ISAC benchmarked against optical separate communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>RIS Empowered Near-Field Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an extremely large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (XL-RIS) empowered covert communication system in the near-field region. Alice covertly transmits messages to Bob with the assistance of the XL-RIS, while evading detection by Willie. To enhance the covert communication performance, we maximize the achievable covert rate by jointly optimizing the hybrid analog and digital beamformers at Alice, as well as the reflection coefficient matrix at the XL-RIS. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the joint beamforming design problem. For the hybrid beamformer design, a semi-closed-form solution for fully digital beamformer is first obtained by a weighted minimum mean-square error based algorithm, then the baseband digital and analog beamformers at Alice are designed by approximating the fully digital beamformer via manifold optimization. For the XL-RIS's reflection coefficient matrix design, a low-complexity alternating direction method of multipliers based algorithm is proposed to address the challenge of large-scale variables and unit-modulus constraints. Numerical results unveil that i) the near-field communications can achieve a higher covert rate than the far-field covert communications in general, and still realize covert transmission even if Willie is located at the same direction as Bob and closer to the XL-RIS; ii) the proposed algorithm can enhance the covert rate significantly compared to the benchmark schemes; iii) the proposed algorithm leads to a beam diffraction pattern that can bypass Willie and achieve high-rate covert transmission to Bob.</description>

      <title>Unified Capacity Results for Free-Space Optical Communication Systems Over Gamma-Gamma Atmospheric Turbulence Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11352v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transmit power control, as in the mobile wireless channels, can enable a robust and spectrally efficient communication through atmospheric turbulence in terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) channels. With optical bandwidths in excess of several GHz and eye safety regulations limiting the transmit optical power, the per hertz signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terrestrial FSO systems can possibly become limited. This is especially true for future high-bandwidth and long-haul terrestrial systems based on coherent optical communications. Hence, power control becomes significant in terrestrial FSO communication systems. However, a comprehensive study of dynamic power adaptation in the existing FSO systems is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we investigate perfectly beam power-controlled terrestrial FSO communication systems with heterodyne detection and direct detection based receivers operating under shot noise-limited conditions. Under these systems considerations, we derive unified exact and asymptotic capacity formulas for the Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels with and without pointing errors. The numerical results highlight the intricate relations of atmospheric turbulence and pointing error parameters in typical terrestrial FSO channel settings. More importantly, a concrete assessment of the impact of the key channel parameters on the capacity performances of the aforementioned FSO systems is performed revealing several novel and interesting insights.</description>

      <title>Spatial Craving Patterns in Marijuana Users: Insights from fMRI Brain Connectivity Analysis with High-Order Graph Attention Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00033v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excessive consumption of marijuana can induce substantial psychological and social consequences. In this investigation, we propose an elucidative framework termed high-order graph attention neural networks (HOGANN) for the classification of Marijuana addiction, coupled with an analysis of localized brain network communities exhibiting abnormal activities among chronic marijuana users. HOGANN integrates dynamic intrinsic functional brain networks, estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using graph attention-based long short-term memory (GAT-LSTM) to capture temporal network dynamics. We employ a high-order attention module for information fusion and message passing among neighboring nodes, enhancing the network community analysis. Our model is validated across two distinct data cohorts, yielding substantially higher classification accuracy than benchmark algorithms. Furthermore, we discern the most pertinent subnetworks and cognitive regions affected by persistent marijuana consumption, indicating adverse effects on functional brain networks, particularly within the dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Intriguingly, our model demonstrates superior performance in cohorts exhibiting prolonged dependence, implying that prolonged marijuana usage induces more pronounced alterations in brain networks. The model proficiently identifies craving brain maps, thereby delineating critical brain regions for analysis</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. This paper presents DEEP-IoT, an innovative communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering feedback channel coding strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Tensor Star Tensor Decomposition and Its Applications to Higher-order Compression and Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel tensor decomposition framework, termed Tensor Star (TS) decomposition, is proposed which represents a new type of tensor network decomposition based on tensor contractions. This is achieved by connecting the core tensors in a ring shape, whereby the core tensors act as skip connections between the factor tensors and allow for direct correlation characterisation between any two arbitrary dimensions. Uniquely, this makes it possible to decompose an order-$N$ tensor into $N$ order-$3$ factor tensors $\{\mathcal{G}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{N}$ and $N$ order-$4$ core tensors $\{\mathcal{C}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{N}$, which are arranged in a star shape. Unlike the class of Tensor Train (TT) decompositions, these factor tensors are not directly connected to one another. The so obtained core tensors also enable consecutive factor tensors to have different latent ranks. In this way, the TS decomposition alleviates the "curse of dimensionality" and controls the "curse of ranks", exhibiting a storage complexity which scales linearly with the number of dimensions and as the fourth power of the ranks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates physical layer security (PLS) in a movable antenna (MA)-assisted full-duplex (FD) system. In this system, an FD base station (BS) with multiple MAs for transmission and reception provides services for an uplink (UL) user and a downlink (DL) user. Each user operates in half-duplex (HD) mode and is equipped with a single fixed-position antenna (FPA), in the presence of a single-FPA eavesdropper (Eve). To ensure secure communication, artificial noise (AN) is transmitted to obstruct the interception of Eve. The objective of this paper is to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of the UL and DL users by jointly optimizing the beamformers of the BS and the positions of MAs. This paper also proposes an alternating optimization (AO) method to address the non-convex problem, which decomposes the optimization problem into three subproblems and solves them iteratively. Simulation results demonstrate a significant performance gain in the SSR achieved by the proposed scheme compared to the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Fourier Approach to the Parameter Estimation Problem for One-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel algorithm for estimating parameters in one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The algorithm takes advantage of the Hankel structure inherent in the Fourier data obtained from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples of the mixture. For GMMs with a unified variance, a singular value ratio functional using the Fourier data is introduced and used to resolve the variance and component number simultaneously. The consistency of the estimator is derived. Compared to classic algorithms such as the method of moments and the maximum likelihood method, the proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the number of Gaussian components or good initial guesses. Numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance in estimation accuracy and computational cost. Second, we reveal that there exists a fundamental limit to the problem of estimating the number of Gaussian components or model order in the mixture model if the number of i.i.d samples is finite. For the case of a single variance, we show that the model order can be successfully estimated only if the minimum separation distance between the component means exceeds a certain threshold value and can fail if below. We derive a lower bound for this threshold value, referred to as the computational resolution limit, in terms of the number of i.i.d samples, the variance, and the number of Gaussian components. Numerical experiments confirm this phase transition phenomenon in estimating the model order. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better scores in likelihood, AIC, and BIC when compared to the EM algorithm.</description>

      <title>Wall-Street: Smart Surface-Enabled 5G mmWave for Roadside Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 5G mmWave roadside networks promise high-speed wireless connectivity, but face significant challenges in maintaining reliable connections for users moving at high speed. Frequent handovers, complex beam alignment, and signal attenuation due to obstacles like car bodies lead to service interruptions and degraded performance. We present Wall-Street, a smart surface installed on vehicles to enhance 5G mmWave connectivity for users inside. Wall-Street improves mobility management by (1) steering outdoor mmWave signals into the vehicle, ensuring coverage for all users; (2) enabling simultaneous serving cell data transfer and candidate handover cell measurement, allowing seamless handovers without service interruption; and (3) combining beams from source and target cells during a handover to increase reliability. Through its flexible signal manipulation capabilities, Wall-Street provides uninterrupted high-speed connectivity for latency-sensitive applications in challenging mobile environments. We have implemented and integrated Wall-Street in the COSMOS testbed and evaluated its real-time performance with three gNBs and multiple mobile clients inside a surface-enabled vehicle, driving on a nearby road. In multi-UE scenarios, Wall-Street doubles the average TCP throughput and reduces delay by 30% over a baseline 5G Standalone handover protocol.</description>

      <title>R-SFLLM: Jamming Resilient Framework for Split Federated Learning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for word embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs), which are crucial for language understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming LLM word embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using BERT and RoBERTa models demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and datasets. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the LLM's resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.</description>

      <title>The Transferability of Downsamped Sparse Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To accelerate the training of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) on real-world large-scale sparse graphs, downsampling methods are commonly employed as a preprocessing step. However, the effects of graph sparsity and topological structure on the transferability of downsampling methods have not been rigorously analyzed or theoretically guaranteed, particularly when the topological structure is affected by graph sparsity. In this paper, we introduce a novel downsampling method based on a sparse random graph model and derive an expected upper bound for the transfer error. Our findings show that smaller original graph sizes, higher expected average degrees, and increased sampling rates contribute to reducing this upper bound. Experimental results validate the theoretical predictions. By incorporating both sparsity and topological similarity into the model, this study establishes an upper bound on the transfer error for downsampling in the training of large-scale sparse graphs and provides insight into the influence of topological structure on transfer performance.</description>

      <title>Latent-EnSF: A Latent Ensemble Score Filter for High-Dimensional Data Assimilation with Sparse Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling and prediction of complex physical systems often rely on data assimilation techniques to correct errors inherent in model simulations. Traditional methods like the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and its variants as well as the recently developed Ensemble Score Filters (EnSF) face significant challenges when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear Bayesian filtering problems with sparse observations, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel data assimilation method, Latent-EnSF, which leverages EnSF with efficient and consistent latent representations of the full states and sparse observations to address the joint challenges of high dimensionlity in states and high sparsity in observations for nonlinear Bayesian filtering. We introduce a coupled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with two encoders to encode the full states and sparse observations in a consistent way guaranteed by a latent distribution matching and regularization as well as a consistent state reconstruction. With comparison to several methods, we demonstrate the higher accuracy, faster convergence, and higher efficiency of Latent-EnSF for two challenging applications with complex models in shallow water wave propagation and medium-range weather forecasting, for highly sparse observations in both space and time.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna (6DMA) for Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an emerging technology that is able to fully exploit the spatial variation of wireless channels by controlling the 3D positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces at the transmitter/receiver. In this letter, we apply 6DMA at the base station (BS) to enhance its wireless sensing performance over a given set of regions. To this end, we first divide each region into a number of equal-size subregions and select one typical target location within each subregion. Then, we derive an expression for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the directions of arrival (DoAs) from these typical target locations in all regions, which sheds light on the sensing performance of 6DMA enhanced systems in terms of a power gain and a geometric gain. Next, we minimize the CRB for DoA estimation via jointly optimizing the positions and rotations of all 6DMAs at the BS, subject to practical movement constraints, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem sub-optimally. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the significant improvement in DoA estimation accuracy achieved by the proposed 6DMA sensing scheme as compared to various benchmark schemes, for both isotropic and directive antenna radiation patterns.</description>
