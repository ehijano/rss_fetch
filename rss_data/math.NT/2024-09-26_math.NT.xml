      <title>Sign changes along geodesics of modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact segment, $\beta$, of a cuspidal geodesic on the modular surface, we study the number of sign changes of cusp forms and Eisenstein series along $\beta$. We prove unconditionally a sharp lower bound for Eisenstein series along a full density set of spectral parameters. Conditioned on certain moment bounds, we extend this to all spectral parameters, and prove similar theorems for cusp forms. The arguments rely in part on the authors' mean square bounds [KKL24], and on removing the assumption of the Lindel\"of hypothesis from recent work of Ki [Ki23].</description>

      <title>Rankin-Selberg L-Functions for GSpin x GL Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an integral representation for the global Rankin-Selberg (partial) $L$-function $L(s, \pi \times \tau)$ where $\pi$ is an irreducible globally generic cuspidal automorphic representation of a general spin group (over an arbitrary number field) and $\tau$ is one of a general linear group, generalizing the works of Gelbart, Piatetski-Shapiro, Rallis, Ginzburg, Soudry and Kaplan among others. We consider all ranks and both even and odd general spin groups including the quasi-split forms. The resulting facts about the location of poles of $L(s, \pi \times \tau)$ have, in particular, important consequences in describing the image of the Langlands funtorial transfer from the general spin groups to general linear groups.</description>

      <title>Equivalent criteria for the Reimann hypothesis for a general class of $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1916, Riesz gave an equivalent criterion for the Riemann hypothesis (RH). Inspired from Riesz's criterion, Hardy and Littlewood showed that RH is equivalent to the following bound: \begin{align*} P_1(x):= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n} \exp\left({-\frac{x}{n^2}}\right) = O_{\epsilon}\left( x^{-\frac{1}{4}+ \epsilon } \right), \quad \mathrm{as}\,\, x \rightarrow \infty. \end{align*} Recently, the authors extended the above bound for the generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions and gave a conjecture for a class of ``nice'' $L$-functions. In this paper, we settle this conjecture. In particular, we give equivalent criteria for the Riemann hypothesis for $L$-functions associated to cusp forms. We also obtain an entirely novel form of equivalent criteria for the Riemann hypothesis of $\zeta(s)$. Furthermore, we generalize an identity of Ramanujan, Hardy and Littlewood for Chandrasekharan-Narasimhan class of $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>Singularities of Steinberg deformation rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $l$ and $p$ be distinct primes, let $F$ be a local field with residue field of characteristic $p$, and let $\mathfrak{X}$ be the irreducible component of the moduli space of Langlands parameters for $GL_3$ over $\mathbb{Z}_l$ corresponding to parameters of Steinberg type. We show that $\mathfrak{X}$ is Cohen-Macaulay and compute explicit equations for it. We also compute the Weil divisor class group of the special fibre of $\mathfrak{X}$, motivated by work of Manning for $GL_2$. Our methods involve the calculation of the cohomology of certain vector bundles on the flag variety, and build on work of Snowden, Vilonen-Xue, and Ngo.</description>

      <title>Precision Asymptotics for Partitions Featuring False-Indefinite Theta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andrews-Dyson-Hickerson, Cohen build a striking relation between q-hypergeometric series, real quadratic fields, and Maass forms. Thanks to the works of Lewis-Zagier and Zwegers we have a complete understanding on the part of these relations pertaining to Maass forms and false-indefinite theta functions. In particular, we can systematically distinguish and study the class of false-indefinite theta functions related to Maass forms. A crucial component here is the framework of mock Maass theta functions built by Zwegers in analogy with his earlier work on indefinite theta functions and their application to Ramanujan's mock theta functions. Given this understanding, a natural question is to what extent one can utilize modular properties to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the associated Fourier coefficients, especially in view of their relevance to combinatorial objects. In this paper, we develop the relevant methods to study such a question and show that quite detailed results can be obtained on the asymptotic development, which also enable Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher type exact formulas under the right conditions. We develop these techniques by concentrating on a concrete example involving partitions with parts separated by parity and derive an asymptotic expansion that includes all the exponentially growing terms.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families of polynomials over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an analog of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem to polynomial rings over finite fields, affirmatively answering a conjecture of C. Tompkins.
  A $k$-uniform family of subsets of a set of finite size $n$ is $l$-intersecting if any two subsets in the family intersect in at least $l$ elements. The study of such intersecting families is a core subject of extremal set theory, tracing its roots to the seminal 1961 Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem, which establishes a sharp upper bound on the size of these families.
  As an analog of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem, we determine the largest possible size of a family of monic polynomials, each of degree $n$, over a finite field $F_q$, where every pair of polynomials in the family shares a common factor of degree at least $l$. We establish that the upper bound for this size is $q^{n-l}$ and further characterize all extremal families that achieve this maximum size.
  Further extending our study to triple-intersecting families, where every triplet of polynomials shares a common factor of degree at least $l$, we prove that only trivial families achieve the corresponding upper bound. Moreover, by relaxing the conditions to include polynomials of degree at most $n$, we affirm that the same upper bound holds and only trivial families achieve the corresponding upper bound.</description>

      <title>On integral aspects of Asai periods and Euler systems for $\mathrm{Res}_{E/\mathbf{Q}}\mathrm{GL}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbf{Q}$ be a totally real quadratic field. Using unramified harmonic analysis in Hecke modules, we study the $\ell$-adic integral behavior of the (unramified part of the) Asai period attached to a Hilbert modular form for $E$, when evaluated on arbitrary integral test data in the sense of Loeffler. Using the same representation-theoretic framework, we also prove the conjectured integral behavior of local factors appearing in tame norm relations, between any collection of integral motivic Asai-Flach classes in the recipe of Loeffler-Skinner-Zerbes. Finally, specializing to one such specific integral collection, we obtain the most general version of the Asai-Flach Euler system tame norm relations, extending a result of Grossi.</description>

      <title>Integers that are sums of two cubes in the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a cubefree natural number and $p\geq 5$ be a prime number. Assume that $n$ is not expressible as a sum of the form $x^3+y^3$, where $x,y\in \mathbb{Q}$. In this note, we study the solutions (or lack thereof) to the equation $n=x^3+y^3$, where $x$ and $y$ belong to the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. As an application, consider the case when $n$ is not a sum of rational cubes. Then, we prove that $n$ cannot be a sum of two cubes in certain large families of prime cyclic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>A bound on the $\mu$-invariants of supersingular elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and let $p$ be a prime of good supersingular reduction. Attached to $E$ are pairs of Iwasawa invariants $\mu_p^\pm$ and $\lambda_p^\pm$ which encode arithmetic properties of $E$ along the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. A well-known conjecture of B. Perrin-Riou and R. Pollack asserts that $\mu_p^\pm=0$. We provide support for this conjecture by proving that for all but finitely many primes, if $\lambda_p^\pm =0$ then $\mu_p^\pm$ is at most 1 or 2, and if $\lambda_p^\pm =1$ then $\mu_p^\pm$ is at most 3 or $p+1+\lceil \frac{p}{\log p}\rceil$, depending on sign. As a corollary, we show that if $E$ has rank 0 then $\mu_p^-\leq 1$ and $\mu_p^+\leq 2$ hold on density 1 set of good supersingular primes.</description>

      <title>On the number of quadratic polynomials with a given portrait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a number field. Given a quadratic polynomial $f_c(z) = z^2 + c \in F[z]$, we can construct a directed graph $Preper(f_c, F)$ (also called a portrait), whose vertices are $F$-rational preperiodic points for $f_c$, with an edge $\alpha \to \beta$ if and only if $f_c(\alpha) = \beta$. Poonen and Faber classified the portraits that occur for infinitely many $c$'s.
  Given a portrait $P$, we prove an asymptotic formula for counting the number of $c \in F$'s by height, such that $Preper(f_c, F) \cong P$. We also prove an asymptotic formula for the analogous counting problem, where $Preper(f_c, K) \cong P$ for some quadratic extension $K/F$. These results are conditioned on Morton-Silverman conjecture.</description>

We also completely characterize the $\alpha$'s which can be expressed in exactly $2$ ways. Subsequently, we apply this result to determine the elements with $6$ partitions.</description>

      <title>Perfectoid pure singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a prime number $p$. Inspired by the notion of $F$-pure or $F$-split singularities, we study the condition that a Noetherian ring with $p$ in its Jacobson radical is pure inside some perfectoid (classical) ring, a condition we call \emph{perfectoid pure}. We also study a related a priori weaker condition which asks that $R$ is pure in its absolute perfectoidization, a condition we call \emph{lim-perfectoid pure}. We show that both these notions coincide when $R$ is LCI. Mixed characteristic analogs of $F$-injective and Du Bois singularities are also explored. We study these notions of singularity, proving that they are weakly normal and that they are Du Bois after inverting $p$. We also explore the behavior of perfectoid singularities under finite covers and their relation to log canonical singularities. Finally, we prove an inversion of adjunction result in the LCI setting, and use it to prove that many common examples are perfectoid pure.</description>

      <title>Certifying rings of integers in number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Number fields and their rings of integers, which generalize the rational numbers and the integers, are foundational objects in number theory. There are several computer algebra systems and databases concerned with the computational aspects of these. In particular, computing the ring of integers of a given number field is one of the main tasks of computational algebraic number theory. In this paper, we describe a formalization in Lean 4 for certifying such computations. In order to accomplish this, we developed several data types amenable to computation. Moreover, many other underlying mathematical concepts and results had to be formalized, most of which are also of independent interest. These include resultants and discriminants, as well as methods for proving irreducibility of univariate polynomials over finite fields and over the rational numbers. To illustrate the feasibility of our strategy, we formally verified entries from the $\textit{Number fields}$ section of the $\textit{L-functions and modular forms database}$ (LMFDB). These concern, for several number fields, the explicitly given $\textit{integral basis}$ of the ring of integers and the $\textit{discriminant}$. To accomplish this, we wrote SageMath code that computes the corresponding certificates and outputs a Lean proof of the statement to be verified.</description>

Abstract: We study Shalika models for generic unramified representations of $\mathrm{PGU}_{2,2}$ over non-archimedean local fields. We prove that they always exist and show that they are in fact unique up to constant by means of the theta correspondence for $(\mathrm{PGSp}_4,\mathrm{PGU}_{2,2})$. We then prove a Casselman-Shalika formula which relates the values of spherical Shalika functionals on ${\rm PGU}_{2,2}$ to the values of finite dimensional complex representations of the dual group of $\mathrm{PGSp}_4$.</description>

Abstract: Ramanujan studied a general class of Stirling constants that are the resummation of some natural divergent series. These constants include the classical Euler-Mascheroni, Stirling and Glaisher-Kinkelin constants. We find natural integral representations for all these constants that appear as exponential periods in the field $\mathbb Q (t,e^{-t})$ which reveals their natural transalgebraic nature. We conjecture that all these constants are transcendental numbers. Euler-Mascheroni's and Stirling's integral formula are classical, but the integral formula for Glaisher-Kinkelin appears to be new, as well as the integral formulas for the higher Stirling-Ramanujan constants. The method presented generalizes naturally to prove that many other constants are exponential periods over the field $\mathbb Q(t,e^{-t})$.</description>

      <title>Modular resurgent structures</title>

Abstract: The theory of resurgence uniquely associates a factorially divergent formal power series with a collection of exponentially small non-perturbative corrections paired with a set of complex numbers known as Stokes constants. When the Borel plane displays a single infinite tower of singularities, the secondary resurgent series are trivial, and the Stokes constants are coefficients of an $L$-function, a rich analytic number-theoretic fabric underlies the resurgent structure of the asymptotic series. We propose a new paradigm of modular resurgence that focuses on the role of the Stokes constants and the interplay of the $q$-series acting as their generating functions with the corresponding $L$-functions. Guided by two pivotal examples arising from topological string theory and the theory of Maass cusp forms, we introduce the notion of modular resurgent series, which we conjecture to have specific summability properties as well as to be related to quantum modular forms.</description>

      <title>On eventually greedy best underapproximations by Egyptian fractions</title>

Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham found it conceivable that the best $n$-term Egyptian underapproximation of almost every positive number for sufficiently large $n$ gets constructed in a greedy manner, i.e., from the best $(n-1)$-term Egyptian underapproximation. We show that the opposite is true: the set of real numbers with this property has Lebesgue measure zero. [This note solves Problem 206 on Bloom's website "Erd\H{o}s problems".]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k_\infty$ be the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension field of an algebraic number field $k$. Moreover, we take a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $K_\infty$ over $k_\infty$. In this paper, we study the behavior of the $p$-part of the class number of certain intermediate fields of $K_\infty /k$. We also consider the structure of the unramified Iwasawa module of $K_\infty / k_\infty$ for several cases.</description>

      <title>The Comma Sequence is Finite in Other Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The comma sequence (1, 12, 35, 94, ...) is the lexicographically earliest sequence such that the difference of consecutive terms equals the concatenation of the digits on either side of the comma separating them. The behavior of a "generalized comma sequence" depends on the base the numbers are written in, as well as the sequence's initial values. We provide a computational proof that all comma sequences in bases 3 through 633 are finite. Relying on a combinatorial conjecture, Angelini et al. estimated that the final element of a comma sequence in base b should be roughly exp(O(b)). We prove their conjecture, but provide evidence that the correct estimate is actually exp(O(b log b)).</description>

      <title>Supercongruences arising from Ramanujan-Sato Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the authors with Lea Beneish established a recipe for constructing Ramanujan-Sato series for $1/\pi$, and used this to construct 11 explicit examples of Ramanujan-Sato series arising from modular forms for arithmetic triangle groups of non-compact type. Here, we use work of Chisholm, Deines, Long, Nebe and the third author to prove a general $p$-adic supercongruence theorem through an explicit connection to CM hypergeometric elliptic curves that provides $p$-adic analogues of these Ramanujan-Sato series. We further use this theorem to construct explicit examples related to each of our explicit Ramanujan-Sato series examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove upper and lower bounds on the number of pairs of commuting $n\times n$ matrices with integer entries in $[-T,T]$, as $T\to \infty$. Our work uses Fourier analysis and leads us to an analysis of exponential sums involving matrices over finite fields. These are bounded by combining a stratification result of Fouvry and Katz with a new result about the flatness of the commutator Lie bracket.</description>

      <title>The Differential and Boomerang Properties of a Class of Binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd prime power with $q\equiv 3\ ({\rm{mod}}\ 4)$. In this paper, we study the differential and boomerang properties of the function $F_{2,u}(x)=x^2\big(1+u\eta(x)\big)$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, where $u\in\mathbb{F}_{q}^*$ and $\eta$ is the quadratic character of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We determine the differential uniformity of $F_{2,u}$ for any $u\in\mathbb{F}_{q}^*$ and determine the differential spectra and boomerang uniformity of the locally-APN functions $F_{2,\pm 1}$, thereby disproving a conjecture proposed in \cite{budaghyan2024arithmetization} which states that there exist infinitely many $q$ and $u$ such that $F_{2,u}$ is an APN function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shnirel'man's inequality and Shnirel'man's basis theorem are fundamental results about sums of sets of positive integers in additive number theory. It is proved that these results are inherently order-theoretic and extend to partially ordered abelian and nonabelian groups. One abelian application is an addition theorem for sums of sets of $n$-dimensional lattice points.</description>
