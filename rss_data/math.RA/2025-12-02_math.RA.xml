      <title>Sheaf Theory and Derived Gamma Geometry over the Non-Commutative Gamma Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the geometric and homological framework for non-commutative $n$-ary $\Gamma$-semirings by constructing a sheaf and derived theory over their non-commutative $\Gamma$-spectrum. Starting with a non-commutative $n$-ary $\Gamma$-semiring $(T,+,\Gamma,\mu)$ and its bi-$\Gamma$-modules, we define the space $\Spec_{\Gamma}^{\mathrm{nc}}(T)$, equip it with a Zariski-type topology, and build the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}{\Spec{\Gamma}^{\mathrm{nc}}(T)}$ via localization at prime $\Gamma$-ideals. We introduce quasi-coherent $\Gamma$-sheaves, show that their category is exact with enough injectives, and interpret the derived functors $\Ext^{\Gamma}$ and $\Tor^{\Gamma}$ as global cohomological invariants on this non-commutative $\Gamma$-space.
  On the derived side, we construct the category $\mathbf{D}(\QCoh(\Spec_{\Gamma}^{\mathrm{nc}}(T)))$, establish a local--global principle for $\Ext^{\Gamma}$ and $\Tor^{\Gamma}$, and prove a non-commutative local duality theorem assuming a dualizing complex. We further introduce derived non-commutative $\Gamma$-stacks and a dg-enhancement of the spectrum, giving a spectral and motivic interpretation of homological invariants. Structural consequences include a Wedderburn--Artin type decomposition in the $n$-ary $\Gamma$-setting, a derived Morita theory for semisimple $n$-ary $\Gamma$-semirings, and a duality between the primitive $\Gamma$-spectrum and simple objects of the derived category. These results extend our earlier commutative derived $\Gamma$-geometry to a fully non-commutative $n$-ary context.</description>

      <title>Matched pairs of Hopf algebras and Rota-Baxter Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study Rota-Baxter Hopf algebras of weight $-1$ and construct a matched pair of Hopf algebras on every Rota-Baxter Hopf algebra of weight $-1$. Then we propose the notion of projection homomorphism pairs on a matched pair of Hopf algebras, and show that every projection homomorphism pair $(C,\wtd{C})$ induces a Rota-Baxter Hopf algebra. Conversely, we prove that the matched pair of Hopf algebras on a Rota-Baxter Hopf algebra of weight $-1$ $(H,B)$ gives rise to a projection homomorphism pair $(C,\wtd{C})$. Furthermore, we study the Rota-Baxter Hopf algebra structure on $\im C$ that is Rota-Baxter isomorphic to $(H,B)$, and investigate the relationship between the Rota-Baxter Hopf algebra structure on $\im \wtd{C}$ and the descendent Rota-Baxter Hopf algebra $(H_{B},B)$.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Criterion for Singular or Nonsingular of Diagonally Dominant Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of determining whether a diagonally dominant matrix is singular or nonsingular is a classical topic in matrix theory. This paper develops necessary and sufficient conditions for the singularity or nonsingularity of diagonally dominant matrices. Starting from Taussky's theorem, we establish a unified line of theory which reduces the general problem to the study of irreducible diagonally dominant matrices. A complete similarity and unitary similarity analysis is given for singular irreducible diagonally dominant matrices, leading to a necessary and sufficient condition expressed in terms of an angle equation system associated with the nonzero off-diagonal entries. Applications and motivations from network dynamical systems, affine multi-agent systems, and Kolmogorov differential equations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Transposed Poisson structures on the $q$-analog Virasoro-like algebras and $q$-Quantum Torus Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transposed Poisson structures on both the $q$-analog Virasoro-like algebra and $q$-quantum torus Lie algebra considering the cases where $q$ is generic and where $q$ is a primitive root of unity, respectively. We establish the following results: When $q$ is generic, there are no non-trivial $\frac{1}{2}$-derivations and consequently, no non-trivial transposed Poisson algebra structures exist on the $q$-analog Virasoro-like algebra. Meanwhile, the $q$-quantum torus Lie algebra does possess non-trivial $\frac{1}{2}$-derivations but lacks of a non-trivial transposed Poisson structure. When $q$ is a primitive root of unity, both the $q$-analog Virasoro-like algebra and the $q$-quantum torus Lie algebra possess non-trivial $\frac{1}{2}$-derivations. We present the non-trivial transposed Poisson algebra structure for the $q$-analog Virasoro-like algebra. However, the $q$-quantum torus Lie algebra lacks of a non-trivial transposed Poisson structure.</description>

      <title>Representations of the Grassmann Poisson superalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every irreducible Poisson supermodule over the Grassmann Poisson superalgebra $G_n$ over a field of characteristic different from $2$ is isomorphic to the regular Poisson supermodule $\mathrm{Reg}\,G_n$ or to its opposite supermodule. Moreover, every unital Poisson supermodule over $G_n$ is completely reducible. If $P$ is a unital Poisson superalgebra which contains $G_n$ with the same unit then $P\cong Q\otimes G_n$ for some Poisson superalgebra $Q$. Furthermore, we classify the supermodules over $G_n$ in the category of dot-bracket superalgebras with Jordan brackets, and we prove that every irreducible Jordan supermodule over the Kantor double $\mathrm{Kan}\,G_n$ is isomorphic to the supermodule $\mathrm{Kan}\,V$, where $V$ is an irreducible dot-bracket supermodule with a Jordan bracket over $G_n$.</description>

      <title>A guide to topological reconstruction on endomorphism monoids and polymorphism clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various spaces of symmetries of a structure are naturally endowed with both an algebraic and a topological structure. For example, the automorphism group of a structure is, on top of being a group, a topological group when equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence. In some cases, the algebraic structure of such space alone is sufficiently rich to determine its topology (under some requirements on the topology). For automorphism groups, the problem of when this happens has been actively pursued over the last 40 years. With the exception of some early work of Lascar, the analogue of this problem for endomorphism monoids and polymorphism clones has only received attention in the past 15 years. In this guide, we survey the current state of affairs in this relatively young line of research. We moreover use this opportunity to polish several existing results and to extend them beyond what was hitherto known.</description>

      <title>Lifting free modules to generalized Weyl algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study modules over a generalized Weyl algebra $R(\sigma,a)$ which are free when restricted to the base ring $R$. When $R$ is an integral domain, we construct all such finite-rank modules up to isomorphism, leading to new simple modules over a variety of algebras. In particular, we show that free modules that have rank $1$ over $R$ can be parametrized as $V_{\mathsf{p}}$ where $\mathsf{p}$ is a divisor of $a$. We give simplicity criteria for $V_{\mathsf{p}}$ and, additionally, when $R$ is a PID, provide a complete combinatorial description of the submodule structure of $V_{\mathsf{p}}$ and of the weight modules occurring as subquotients. We also show that, under some mild conditions on $R(\sigma,a)$, there exist simple $R$-free modules of arbitrary finite rank. We apply our results to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ in order to construct new families of simple Cartan-free modules of all finite ranks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the upper bound conjecture proposed by Saeedi Madani \&amp; Kiani on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of generalized binomial edge ideals. We give a combinatorial upper bound of regularity for generalized binomial edge ideals, which is better than the bound claimed in that conjecture. Also, we show that the bound is tight by providing an infinite class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Invariants of Superalgebras as Complex Integrals</title>

Abstract: In [A. Berele, Computing super matrix invariants, {\it Advances in Applied Math. \bf48} (2012), 273--289.] we defined integrals that approximated the Poincar\'e series of the invariants and concomitants of the general linear Lie supergroup or superalgebra. Budzik suggested in [K. Budzik, Supergroup Invariants and the Brane/Negative Brane Expansion, (preprint) arXiv:2509.20451] a way to adapt this method to get the exact Poincar\'e series. The purpose of this paper is to prove that Budzik's ideas are correct. As a consequence we prove that the Poincar\'e series are rational functions.</description>

We prove that $H$ is of finite corepresentation type if and only if it is coNakayama, if and only if the link quiver $\mathrm{Q}(H)$ of $H$ is a disjoint union of basic cycles, if and only if the link-indecomposable component $H_{(1)}$ containing $\Bbbk1$ is a pointed Hopf algebra and the link quiver of $H_{(1)}$ is a basic cycle.</description>

      <title>Minimal generating sets of large powers of bivariate monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that for a monomial ideal $I$, the number of minimal generators, $\mu(I^n)$, eventually follows a polynomial pattern for increasing $n$. In general, little is known about the power at which this pattern emerges. Even less is known about the exact form of the minimal generators after this power. Let $s\ge \mu(I)(d^2-1)+1$, where $d$ is a constant bounded above by the maximal $x$- or $y$-degree appearing in the set $\mathsf{G}(I)$ of minimal generators of $I$. We show that every higher power $I^{s+\ell}$ for any $\ell \ge 0$ can be constructed from certain subideals of $I^s$. This provides an explicit description of~$\mathsf{G}(I^{s+\ell})$ in terms of $\mathsf{G}(I^s)$. Given $\mathsf{G}(I^s)$, this construction significantly reduces computational complexity in determining larger powers of~$I$. This further enables us to explicitly compute $\mu(I^n)$ for all $n\ge s$ in terms of a linear polynomial in $n$. We include runtime measurements for the attached implementation in SageMath.</description>

      <title>On the lattice of multi-sorted relational clones on a two-element set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to the description of multi-sorted clones (sets of $k$-tuples of operations of the same arity, closed under coordinatewise composition and containing all projection tuples) on a two-element domain. Leveraging the well-known Galois connection between operations and relations, we define a small class of canonical relations sufficient to describe all Boolean multi-sorted clones up to non-surjective operations. Furthermore, we introduce elementary operations on relations, which are less cumbersome than general formulas and have many useful properties. Using these tools, we provide a new and elementary proof of the famous Post's lattice theorem. We also show that every multi-sorted clone of $k$-tuples of operations decomposes into a surjective part described by canonical relations and $2k$ clones of $(k-1)$-tuples of operations. This structural understanding allows us to describe an embedding of the lattice of multi-sorted clones into a well-understood poset. In particular, we rederive - by a simpler method - a result of V. Taimanov originally from 1983, showing that every multi-sorted clone on a two-element domain is finitely generated. Finally, we also give a concise proof of the Galois connection between (surjective) multi-sorted clones and the corresponding closed sets of relations.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}(RC)$ be the derived category of representations of a small category $C$ over a commutative noetherian ring $R$. We study the homotopically smashing t-structures on this category. Specifying our discussion to the stalk categories $\Gamma_{\mathfrak{p}}\mathcal{D}(RQ)$ for a finite quiver $Q$ and a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $R$, we prove the telescope conjecture for the derived category of representations of finite quivers over artinian rings. More generally, we prove the same result also outside of the noetherian context, for representations of finite quivers over commutative perfect rings.</description>

      <title>Rings of non-commutative functions and their fields of fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-free ideal rings, or semifirs, were introduced by Paul M. Cohn to study universal localizations in the non-commutative setting. We provide new examples of semifirs consisting of analytic functions in several non-commuting variables. These examples arise canonically in free analysis by completing the free algebra in the topology of ``uniform convergence on operator-space balls'' in the non-commutative universe of tuples of square matrices of any finite size.
  We show, in particular, that the ring of (uniformly) entire non-commutative (NC) functions in $d \in \mathbb{N}$ non-commuting variables, $\scr{O}_d$, is a semifir. Every finitely--generated right (or left) ideal in $\scr{O}_d$ is closed, which yields an analytic extension of G. Bergman's nullstellensatz for the free algebra. Any semifir admits a universal skew field of fractions; applying this to $\scr{O}_d$ yields the universal skew field of ``NC meromorphic expressions", $\scr{M} _d$. We show that any $f \in \scr{M} _d$ has a well-defined domain and evaluations in a large class of stably-finite topological algebras, including finite $C^*$-algebras, extending a result of Cohn for NC rational functions. As an application, we extend the almost sure convergence result of Haagerup and Thorbj\"ornsen for free polynomials evaluated on tuples of random matrices to the setting of NC meromorphic expressions.</description>
