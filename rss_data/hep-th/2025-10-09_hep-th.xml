      <title>Detecting Black Hole Microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Euclidean two-point function of an appropriately chosen probe operator can detect the microstate of an asymptotically AdS black hole. This detection, which requires a tuned, state-dependent choice of probe, is the result of a new gravitational saddle, which dominates over the usual saddles. The gravitational result can be explicitly reproduced in the dual boundary CFT if we assume the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We also discuss a binary search protocol to detect the black hole microstate from a candidate list.</description>

      <title>SymTFT Entanglement and Holographic (Non)-Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two otherwise decoupled $D$-dimensional CFTs which possess a common (finite) symmetry subcategory, one can consider entangled boundary states of their $(D+1)$-dimensional SymTFTs. This roughly corresponds to performing a gauging of the tensor product of two CFTs, and we call this phenomena ``SymTFT entanglement" (or ``S-entanglement" for short). In the case when these CFTs have semiclassical holographic duals, the S-entanglement relates the bulk gauge charges between two otherwise disconnected AdS spacetimes as we highlight in several top-down examples. We show that taking partial traces of such S-entangled states leads to a streamlined approach to preparing ensemble-averaged CFTs in string theory. This ensemble averaging coincides with that generated by $\alpha$-states in the baby universe Hilbert space, and we propose a symmetry-enriched generalization of this Hilbert space via generalized global symmetries. We quantify how this symmetry-governed averaging violates holographic factorization and leads to the emergence of bulk global symmetries. We also consider the eternal (two-sided) AdS black hole geometries, where our SymTFT entanglement considerations imply that there exist refinements of the usual theromofield double state preparation of the system. We show that one may prepare the system in such a way that the total CFT data does not factorize into left and right copies. As anticipated by Marolf and Wall \cite{Marolf:2012xe}, we highlight that such considerations are necessary to define the gauge charges of eternal black holes, and in certain cases, can imply that there exist extended bulk objects stretching across the wormhole which cannot be expressed in terms of a product of left and right CFT operators.</description>

      <title>Stable Evaluation of Lefschetz Thimble Intersection Numbers: Towards Real-Time Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a robust numerical method for determining intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in multivariable settings. Our approach employs the multiple shooting method to solve the upward flow equations from the saddle points to the original integration cycle, which also enables us to determine the signs of the intersection numbers. The method demonstrates stable and reliable performance, and has been tested for systems with up to $20$ variables, which can be further extended by adopting quadruple-precision arithmetic. We determine intersection numbers for several complex saddle points in a discretized path integral, providing new insights into the structure of real-time path integrals. The proposed method is broadly applicable to a wide range of problems involving oscillatory integrals in physics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cosmic Superstrings and the Overshoot Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the techniques of dynamical systems to study the cosmological evolution of cosmic fundamental strings and effective strings arising from branes wrapped on internal cycles. We also include the whole potential of the volume modulus characterised by an early time run-away towards a late time minimum. We analyse the overshoot problem with and without radiation, and find that the presence of an initial population of strings arising from NS5-branes wrapped around 4-cycles is enough to ensure that the modulus stabilises in its late time minimum, even in the absence of radiation. The reason is the transfer of energy between the modulus and the effective strings caused by the fact that their tension depends on the volume modulus. Interestingly, we find that the energy density of cosmic superstrings is generically very large when the modulus is oscillating around its minimum, opening up the possibility of a detectable gravitational wave signal. We also find no evidence of an efficient resonant enhancement of cosmic superstrings due to an oscillating tension in the late time minimum.</description>

      <title>Emergent Mixed States for Baby Universes and Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of sequences of states in the large $N$ limit of AdS/CFT duality in cases in which the bulk duals involve baby universes or black holes. Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under suitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can converge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black holes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do not converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit large $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to convergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial commutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby universe.</description>

      <title>Boundary Conditions of Warped AdS$_3$ in New Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To satisfy the Cardy formula for Warped AdS$_3$ (WAdS$_{3}$) solutions in a quadratic ensemble, a specific set of boundary conditions has been proposed in \cite{Aggarwal:2020igb}. In this paper, these boundary conditions have been investigated in the three-dimensional new massive gravity (NMG) framework. The associated solution space, asymptotic symmetries, and charge algebra have been extracted. It has been shown that the surface charges are finite, but not integrable, and the integrability of the charges is obtained after restricting to a sub-sector of the original solution space. Finally, we have proved that the Cardy formula reproduces the thermodynamic entropy of a warped BTZ black hole.</description>

      <title>From singular to regular: revisiting thermodynamics of Bardeen-AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic properties of the regular Bardeen-AdS black hole obtained by imposing an additional constraint on a singular "mother" black hole. This constraint eliminates the physical singularity but leads to the breakdown of the standard first law of black hole thermodynamics. The singular black hole exhibits a reentrant phase transition similar to that of the higher-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole. The Bardeen-AdS black hole exhibits $P-V$ criticalities similar to that of the RN-AdS black hole, however has striking differences in its Gibbs free energy behavior. In particular, the characteristic "swallow-tail" structure associated with first-order phase transitions disappears. Instead, an "8-shaped" or "c-shaped" structure occurs, signifying a first-order phase transition or a zeroth-order phase transition between the small black hole and the large black hole phases, respectively. Our analysis suggests that constraint-induced modifications in the thermodynamic phase space may have deep consequences for the critical behaviors of black holes.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Yang-Mills matrix integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the large $N$ limit of bosonic $D$-matrix Yang-Mills integrals using two complementary bootstrap methods. In the positivity bootstrap, we obtain bounds for $\langle \text{tr}\, XX \rangle$ and $\langle \text{tr}\, XXXX \rangle$ at various length cutoff $L_{\max}$. For $D=3$, we do not find an isolated region until $L_{\max}=12$. For larger $D$, the allowed regions become islands at $L_{\max}=8$ and shrink rapidly as $L_{\max}$ increases. The precision of some $L_{\max}=12$ islands is comparable to that of Monte Carlo estimates. For a fixed $L_{\max}$, the allowed region also shrinks with $D$ and converges to the large $D$ expansion results. We further deduce the analytic expressions of various types of trajectories and eigenvalue distributions at large $D$. Based on these explicit formulas, we propose some ansatz for the analytic trajectory bootstrap and obtain accurate results for finite $D$.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasinormal modes in Reissner--Nordstr\"om black holes: implications for Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic charged black holes can provide possibilities to test the consistency of the effective field theory (EFT) corrections to Einstein-Maxwell theory. A particularly interesting result is fixing the sign of a certain combination of EFT couplings from the requirement that all charged black holes should be able to evaporate (Weak Gravity Conjecture). In our work, we analysed the EFT corrections to a set of zero-damping quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the scalar wave probe in a nearly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We review the duality of this setup to the problem of the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve of $N=2$ Super-Yang-Mills theory with three flavors. We provide an analytic result for the EFT corrections to the QNMs obtained from the quantization condition imposed on the Seiberg-Witten cycle. Our main result is that the causality requirement of the gravitational theory formulated for the QNMs translates to the same condition on EFT couplings as the one appearing in the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantized Dirac Fields in torsionful gravity: cosmological implications and links with the dark universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a classical field in square torsion theory as a source of torsion for a quantum fermion field in FLRW metric. In the framework of QFT, we obtain vacuum contributions to the energy-momentum tensor and to the axial current that modify the dynamics of the classical field and the field equations as back-reaction. These contributions lead to a modified classical field and therefore to a modified torsion term $L^\mu$ and expectation value of energy-momentum tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$ on the quantum vacuum, altering the field equations in an interative process. We consider the first step of this process and we find that the vacuum condensate could affect the inflationary phase of the Universe. Higher order terms could impact the dark Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start from a Lorentzian action in a deformed light-cone background and applying the method of null reduction leads to a Carrollian action in one lower spacetime dimensions. We also identify the correct light-cone definitions of the symmetry generators and their dynamical forms in terms of the fields and take the $c\rightarrow0$ limit. It is observed that these generators produces the known kinematic Carrollian conformal algebraic commutation relations.</description>

      <title>Universal sectors in superconformal defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study universal features of defect correlation functions in supersymmetric defect CFTs, focusing on four-point functions of the displacement supermultiplet. By perturbing the leading-order correlators at strong coupling, we identify constraints on the operators exchanged at next-to-leading order. We then discuss the conditions under which correlation functions of identical superdisplacement components receive contributions only from multiparticle operators built from the same components. This leads to the equivalence between four-point functions of defect insertions across different theories, establishing universality. We confirm these features in examples including the $1/2$ BPS line in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories and ABJM, up to the first subleading order in the strong-coupling expansion. We then analyze the $1/2$ BPS Wilson line in 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons matter theories, identifying the preserved defect algebra and the superdisplacement multiplet. Exploiting universality, we find the superdisplacement the four-point functions of the defect operators and we extract the conformal data up to the first subleading order. Finally, we comment on the $1/3 $ BPS Wilson line in ABJM, providing initial results for the analysis at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>TBA and wall-crossing for deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a polynomial superpotential with $\hbar$-correction. In the minimal chamber, where all turning points are real and distinct, it was shown that the exact WKB periods obey the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of the undeformed potential. By changing the energy parameter above/below the critical points, the turning points become complex, and the moduli are outside of the minimal chamber. We study the wall-crossing of the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended TBA equations by this change of moduli and show that the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-structure is preserved after the wall-crossing. In particular, the TBA equations for the cubic superpotential are studied in detail, where there are two chambers (minimal and maximal). At the maximally symmetric point in the maximal chamber, the TBA system becomes the two sets of the $D_3$-type TBA equations, which are regarded as the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extension of the $A_3/{\mathbb Z}_2$-TBA equation.</description>

      <title>Localized structures in two-field systems: exact solutions in the presence of Lorentz symmetry breaking and explicit connection with geometric constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of models described by two real scalar fields in two-dimensional spacetime. The study focuses mainly on the presence of exact static solutions which satisfy the first-order formalism, in models constructed to engender Lorentz symmetry violation. We start by exploring a direct connection between Lorentz breaking and geometric constraint, as experimentally examined in the case of domain walls in geometrically constrained magnetic materials. By means of a specific choice of functions, we show that imposing geometric constraint within the Lorentz-violating framework recovers the exact solutions of the corresponding Lorentz-invariant theory. Furthermore, we extend the investigation to new models that go beyond reproducing the Lorentz invariant geometrically constrained solutions, revealing that it remains possible to parametrize the first-order equation of one of the fields through a suitably redefined coordinate.</description>

      <title>Lectures on entanglement, von Neumann algebras, and emergence of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent developments in the use of von Neumann algebras to analyze the entanglement structure of quantum gravity and the emergence of spacetime in the semi-classical limit. Von Neumann algebras provide a natural framework for describing quantum subsystems when standard tensor factorizations are unavailable, capturing both kinematic and dynamical aspects of entanglement.
  The first part of the review introduces the fundamentals of von Neumann algebras, including their classification, and explains how they can be applied to characterize entanglement. Topics covered include modular and half-sided modular flows and their role in the emergence of time, as well as the crossed-product construction of von Neumann algebras.
  The second part turns to applications in quantum gravity, including an algebraic formulation of AdS/CFT in the large-$N$ limit, the emergence of bulk spacetime structure through subregion-subalgebra duality, and an operator-algebraic perspective on gravitational entropy. It also discusses simple operator-algebraic models of quantum gravity, which provide concrete settings in which to explore these ideas. In addition, several original conceptual contributions are presented, including a diagnostic of firewalls and an algebraic formulation of entanglement islands. The review concludes with some speculative remarks on the mathematical structures underlying quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simple explicit formulae for the change of the $g$-function, boundary state, boundary spectrum and structure constants between the endpoints of short boundary RG flows at next-to-leading order. The formulae are derived using open string field theory and tested on integrable RG flows between conformal boundary states in unitary Virasoro minimal models.</description>

      <title>Building an AdS/BCFT Josephson junction within Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the constriction and normal Josephson junctions of superconductors within Horndeski's gravitational theory framework. Through a single scalar field of this theory, we provide a dual holographic description via the AdS/BCFT correspondence. We identify a critical temperature below which a charged condensate forms through a second-order phase transition in constriction and normal junctions. Our findings reveal that the condensate comprises pairs of quasiparticles. The junctions between superconductors are characterized by weak links that lead to supercurrent flow, with their magnitude determined by the phase difference between the superconductors, which is modulated by the Horndeski parameters. This supercurrent is governed by the Josephson current-phase relation, highlighting the intricate interplay between gravitational theory and superconducting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor from a horizontal symmetry in a slice of AdS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a model of lepton flavor in a slice of AdS$_5$. We add to the 5D SM fields a set of neutrino fields, as well as a horizontal U(1) symmetry and a flavon field, all propagating in the bulk. The electroweak and U(1) symmetries are spontaneously broken by a potential localized on the infrared boundary. We show that in a flavor anarchic scenario, by suitable choice of the 5D masses and the U(1) charges, the masses of the SM leptons and the PMNS matrix can be naturally generated. The neutrino masses are Dirac like, with a normal ordered hierarchical spectrum, $\Delta m_{32}^2\approx m_3^2$, $\Delta m_{21}^2\approx m_2^2\gg m_1^2$, and a suppressed $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle. We find configurations where the charged lepton mixing angles are suppressed by powers of the Cabibbo angle ($\lambda_C$) relative to vanilla anarchic partial compositeness, consequently reducing CP and lepton flavor violation. Specifically, the Wilson coefficient for the electron electromagnetic dipole moment exhibits $\lambda_C^2$ suppression, while those governing $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu-e$ vector operators are suppressed by $\lambda_C^{3/2}$ compared to the anarchic scenario without U(1) horizontal symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the role of cosmological constant in modeling hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einsteins gravity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in four dimensions can be reformulated as a $\lambda \phi^4$ theory characterized solely by the dimensionless coupling $\lambda \propto G_N \Lambda$ ($G_N$ being Newton's constant). The quantum triviality of this theory drives $\lambda \to 0$, and a deviation from this behavior could be generated by matter couplings. Here, we study the significance of this conformal symmetry and its breaking in modeling non-perturbative QCD. The hadron spectra and correlation functions are studied holographically in an $AdS_5$ geometry with induced cosmological constants on four-dimensional hypersurface. Our analysis shows that the experimentally measured spectra of the $\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons, including their excitations and decay constants, favour a non-vanishing induced cosmological constant in both hard-wall and soft-wall models. Although this behavior is not as sharp in the soft-wall model as in the hard-wall model, it remains consistent. Furthermore, we show that the correction to the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation has an inverse dependence on the induced cosmological constant, underscoring its significance in holographic descriptions of low-energy QCD.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic corrections to high-pT prompt-psi(2S) production at hadron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relativistic corrections to prompt psi(2S) at high pT in hadron colliders. Our calculation employs leading-power factorization with Fragmentation Functions (FFs) computed in nonrelativistic QCD and evolved to next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Relativistic corrections increase the cross section significantly for the gluon channel, but moderately for charm. We perform a full analysis of uncertainties. We observe a good agreement with both ATLAS and CMS cross sections without the need of higher-order color-octet contributions. The polar anisotropy is found to be close to CMS data.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct a three--parameter family of asymptotically flat Einstein--Maxwell instantons. These solutions are toric, regular, and free of conical and orbifold singularities on the manifold $M=\CP^2\setminus S^1$. They are counterexamples to the Euclidean Einstein--Maxwell Black Hole Uniqueness Conjecture. In the case of vanishing charge these instantons reduce to the Chen--Teo Ricci flat instantons.</description>

      <title>A geometrical approach to neutrino oscillation parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric hypothesis for neutrino mixing: twice the sum of the three mixing angles equals $180^\circ$, forming a Euclidean triangle. This condition leads to a predictive relation among the mixing angles and, through trigonometric constraints, enables reconstruction of the mass-squared splittings. The hypothesis offers a phenomenological resolution to the $\theta_{23}$ octant ambiguity, reproduces the known mass hierarchy patterns, and suggests a normalized geometric structure underlying the PMNS mixing. We show that while an order-of-magnitude scale mismatch remains (the absolute splittings are underestimated by $\sim 10\times$), the triangle reproduces mixing ratios with notable accuracy, hinting at deeper structural or symmetry-based origins. We emphasize that the triangle relation is advanced as an empirical, phenomenological organizing principle rather than a result derived from a specific underlying symmetry or dynamics. It is testable and falsifiable: current global-fit values already lie close to satisfying the condition, and improved precision will confirm or refute it. We also outline and implement a simple $\chi^2$ consistency check against global-fit inputs to quantify agreement within present uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, anomaly index, and generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems with anti-unitary symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools to understand quantum matter. In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted locality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices, which provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary symmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation symmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its anomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the subscript $\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by complex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple Lieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous symmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement area law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an anomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that has an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state, as long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range of the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions, the last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general theorems in various concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild transformation of the Benenti-Francaviglia metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Benenti-Francaviglia (BF) family of metrics provides the most general form of a spacetime metric that admits two mutually commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. The geodesic equations for the BF family are thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class, we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity, we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the present algorithm to ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic generalization of the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope rotating black hole solution, by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics in the Kerr-Schild construction.</description>

      <title>Hyperinvariant Spin Network States -- An AdS/CFT Model from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and limitations for hyperinvariant tensor networks incorporating a local SU(2) symmetry. As discrete implementations of the anti de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity. We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP 06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum transition in 2 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is the prototype of a phase transition driven by the formation and interaction of topological defects in two-dimensional (2D) systems. In typical models these are vortices: above a transition temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$ vortices are free, below this transition temperature they get confined. In this work we extend the concept of BKT transition to quantum systems in two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that a zero-temperature quantum BKT phase transition, driven by a coupling constant can occur in 2D models governed by an effective gauge field theory with a diverging dielectric constant. One particular example is that of a compact U(1) gauge theory with a diverging dielectric constant, where the quantum BKT transition is induced by non-relativistic, purely 2D magnetic monopoles, which can be viewed also as electric vortices. These quantum BKT transitions have the same diverging exponent $z$ as the quantum Griffiths transition but have nothing to do with disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense QCD matter can feature a moat regime, where the static energy of mesons is minimal at nonzero momentum. Valuable insights into this regime can be gained using low-energy models. This, however, requires a careful assessment of model artifacts. We therefore study the effects of renormalization and in-medium modifications of quark-meson interaction on the moat regime. To capture the main effects, we use a two-flavor quark-meson model at finite temperature and baryon density in the random phase approximation. We put forward a convenient renormalization scheme to account for the nontrivial momentum dependence of meson self-energies and discuss the role of renormalization conditions for renormalization group consistent results on the moat regime. In addition, we demonstrate and that its extent in the phase diagram critically depends on the interaction of quarks and mesons.</description>

Abstract: The analytic Langlands correspondence proposed by Etingof, Frenkel and Kazhdan describes the solution to the spectral problems naturally arising in the quantisation of the Hitchin integrable systems in terms of real opers, certain second order differential operators on a Riemann surface having real monodromy. We prove this correspondence in the cases associated to the group $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and Riemann surfaces of genus zero with a number of punctures larger than three. A crucial ingredient is a unitary integral transformation mapping products of solutions to the ordinary differential equation associated to a real oper to eigenfunctions of the quantised Hitchin Hamiltonians. This allows us to construct joint eigenfunctions of Hecke operators and Hitchin Hamiltonians from real opers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open topological string partition function gives rise to open Gromov-Witten invariants, open Donaldson-Thomas invariants and 3D-5D BPS indices. Utilizing the remodelling conjecture which connects topological recursion and topological string theory, in this paper we study open topological string theory for the subclass of toric Calabi-Yau threefold known as strip geometries. For this purpose, certain new developments in the theory of topological recursion are applied as its extension to Logarithmic Topological Recursion (Log-TR) and the universal $x$--$y$ duality. Through this we derive the open topological string partition function and also the associated quantum curve. We also explain how this is related the open Donaldson-Thomas partition function associated with certain symmetric quivers, exponential networks and $q$-Barnes type integrals. In the process, we also connect how 3D-5D wall crossing affects these partition functions as one varies $x$, in examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence or absence of gravitational radiation escaping from the spacetime at $\mathscr{J}$ is characterized in the presence of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ of any sign. To that end, the properties of the asymptotic super-momentum are used. When $\Lambda=0$, the characterization is equivalent to that based on the News tensor. For $\Lambda\neq 0$, it provides the first reliable definition of existence of radiation at $\mathscr{J}$, and it gives fully satisfactory results in known exact solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings, stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>Can One Model Gravitational Nonlinear Memory with Fractional Derivative Operators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether fractional calculus, with its intrinsic long-tailed memory and nonlocal features, can provide a viable model for gravitational-wave memory effects. We consider two toy constructions: ($i$) a fractional modification of the linearized Einstein field equations using a sequential Caputo operator, and ($ii$) a fractionalized quadrupole formula where the source moment is acted upon by the same operator. Both constructions yield history-dependent responses with small memory-like offsets. However, in all cases, the signal decays to zero at late times, failing to reproduce the permanent displacement predicted by GR. Our results, therefore, constitute a no-go demonstration: naive fractionalization is insufficient to model nonlinear gravitational memory. We argue that any successful model must incorporate fractional kernels directly into the hereditary flux-balance integral of General Relativity, while preserving gauge invariance and dimensional consistency. We also discuss possible connections to modified gravity and the absence of memory in the spacetime with dimensions $D&gt;4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $Z_2$ gauging of $Z_N$ symmetry can enforce certain elements of the fermion Yukawa couplings to vanish. We have performed a systematical study of texture zero patterns of lepton mass matrices in the minimal seesaw model, and we present all the possible patterns of the charged lepton Yukawa coupling $Y_E$, neutrino Yukawa coupling $Y_{\nu}$, right-handed neutrino mass matrix $M_R$ and the light neutrino mass matrix $M_{\nu}$ which can be derived from the $Z_2$ gauging of $Z_N$ symmetry. The realization of the textures with the maximum number of zeros and the second maximum number of zeros from non-invertible symmetry is studied, and the phenomenological implications in neutrino oscillation are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications provided by the modified Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand coordinates in the context of quintessence for the Kiselev black hole. In this regard, we set up a fully static line element in terms of lapse and shift functions, apart from including the deformation parameter signaling deviation from the standard Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand metric. We address two specific issues pertaining to the problems of radiation and dust furnished by the corresponding barotropic index parameter and study the related consequences by performing a range of analyses to explore the influence imposed by quintessence. We also discuss the thermodynamical consequences by evaluating the expressions of the Hawking temperature and the entropy function in closed forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study real-time finite-temperature correlators for free scalars of any mass in a $dS_{d+1}$ static patch in any dimension. We show that whenever the inverse temperature is a rational multiple of the inverse de Sitter temperature, certain Matsubara poles of the symmetric Wightman function disappear. At the de Sitter temperature, we explicitly show how the Lorentzian thermal correlators can all be obtained by analytic continuations from the round $S^{d+1}$. We establish the precise relation between the Harish-Chandra character for $SO(1,d+1)$ and the integrated spectral function, providing a novel dynamical perspective on the former and enabling generalizations. Furthermore, we study scalars with exceptional non-positive masses. We provide a physical picture for the distinctive structures of their characters. For the massless case, we perform a consistent static patch quantization, and find the unique $S^{d+1}$ correlator that analytically continues to the correlators in the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative AdS black hole and the IR holographic superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a noncommutative (NC) AdS$_4$-charged black hole with a planar horizon topology. The NC effects of this geometry are captured by a Gaussian distribution of black hole mass codified in a fluid-like energy-momentum tensor. A natural bound in radial coordinate is established, below which the scalar curvature changes its sign and defines a NC cutoff that embeds the point singularity. We study in detail the thermodynamic structure of this scenario, finding a well-defined black hole mass and an analytic criterion for its stability. Focusing on the AdS$_2$ structure near the horizon, we find a novel effective curvature radius with dependency on the NC cutoff. These results motivate us to explore the holographic superconducting system in terms of the nearness from the cutoff. The behavior of the magnetic field in the deep IR geometry is studied and we found semi-analytical novel expressions for the upper critical magnetic fields of a dual type-II superconductor in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. The condensation in the form of hair is studied in terms of the bound states of the associated Schr\"odinger potential of the scalar field, interpreted as the dual to the density of Cooper pairs. The NC effects increase the hair formation due to a steeper AdS$_2$ throat comparable to the commutative case. Finally, we obtain the effective IR scalar field equation on the near-horizon and near-extremal NC Schwarzschild AdS$_2$ geometry and confirm that NC effects promote bound states that the commutative version forbids.</description>

Abstract: Traditionally applied within equilibrium states, the charge-vortex dualities are expanded to address the complex dynamics of superfluids and ideal fluids under non-static conditions. We have constructed explicit mappings of finite temperature fluid dynamics to gauge theories, enabling a dual description where vortices in both superfluids and ideal fluids are interpreted as charges within these theories. We found that vortices in the normal component naturally exhibit mobility restrictions, as manifested by the symmetries and conservation laws. Next, we formulated the Li\'enard-Wiechert problem for the ideal fluid at finite temperature and extracted the wave dynamics in the system along with the speed of sound corrections for both fluid components. Finally, we computed the correlation functions for the gauge potentials, particularly elucidating explicit cross-correlations between the normal and superfluid components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological symmetry operators of holographic large $N$ CFT$_D$'s are dual to dynamical branes in the gravity dual AdS$_{D+1}$. We use this correspondence to establish a dictionary between thermal expectation values of symmetry operators in the Euclidean CFT$_D$ and the evaluation of gravitational saddles in the presence of a dynamical brane. Expectation values of $0$-form symmetry operators in the CFT$_D$ are then related to branes wrapped on volume minimizing cycles in the bulk, i.e., the Euclidean continuation of a black hole horizon. We illustrate with some representative examples, including gravity in AdS$_3$, duality / triality defects in 4D $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory, and the dual of R-symmetry operators probing 5D BPS black holes.</description>

Abstract: Free Maxwell theory on general four-manifolds may, under certain conditions on the background geometry, exhibit holomorphic factorization in its partition function. We show that when this occurs, new discrete symmetries emerge at orbifold points of the conformal manifold. These symmetries, which act only on a sublattice of flux configurations, are not associated with standard dualities, yet they may carry 't Hooft anomalies, potentially causing the partition function to vanish even in the absence of apparent pathologies. We further explore their non-invertible extensions and argue that their anomalies can account for zeros of the partition function at smooth points in the moduli space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quantum tunneling process through a topology transition near a conifold singularity, in the setup of IIB CY3 orientifold compactification. We propose a novel method to do moduli stabilization in an extended moduli space, parametrized by both the geometric moduli and the light D3-brane wrapping modes arisen from the brane quantization. Assuming the absence of flux through the vanishing exceptional 3-cycle, we find two types of vacuum solutions, one corresponds to the resolved conifold and the other one is interpreted as a novel non-geometric phase. We compute the quantum tunneling rate between these two solutions and find that it is difficult to achieve a significantly large tunneling rate in the controllable regime.</description>

Abstract: Wilson line operators in the rank $k$ totally symmetric tensor representation of ${\cal N}=4$ $U(N)$ sypersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are expected to be realized as D3-branes expanded in $AdS_5$. Although there is a mismatch between the corresponding line operator indices even in the large $N$ and large $k$ limit, it is possible to calculate the finite $k$ correction on the AdS side as the contribution from D1-branes. We analyze D1-brane fluctuation modes and calculate the leading finite $k$ correction to the line operator index on the AdS side.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically compute the low-temperature charge correlators in near-extremal black holes with a planar horizon and an infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ extremal geometry, finding excellent agreement with numerical calculations. The analytical result consistently describes the crossover between the hydrodynamic diffusive regime at low frequencies and wavenumbers, and the quantum, zero-temperature regime at high frequencies and wavenumbers. We analytically resolve the successive collisions between the diffusive pole and the non-hydrodynamic poles sourced by the infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ geometry. We demonstrate that in the $T=0$ limit, a pair of gapless poles survive with a dispersion relation $\omega_\pm=-i d_2 k^2-i d_4 k^4-i\tilde d_4 k^4(\pm i\pi+\log k^2) $. The nonanalytic contributions arise from the interplay with the branch cut formed by the condensation of the non-hydrodynamic poles. The real part is caused by the `snatching' of one of the non-hydrodynamic poles by the hydrodynamic diffusive pole.</description>

      <title>On the string theory of a single NS5-brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a worldsheet description of string theory in the background of a single decoupled NS5-brane, which is a particularly simple example of ``little string'' holography. The worldsheet theory involves a gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model for the group coset $\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{H}$, where $\mathcal{G} = {PSU(1,1|2)} \times \mathbb R^{5,1}$ and $\mathcal{H}=U(1) \times U(1)$. A variant of the embedding of $\mathcal{H}$ into $\mathcal{G}$ describes a background that interpolates between the fivebrane throat in the UV and $AdS_3$ in the IR, which is dual to the (single trace) $T\bar T$-deformed symmetric product orbifold $(\mathbb T^4)^N/S_N$. Well-known difficulties with a worldsheet theory for $n_5=1$ fivebranes are bypassed by the incorporation of an extra constraint on the dynamics. This constraint arises naturally from consideration of the effects of deforming the theory by one of the four Ramond-Ramond moduli of the spacetime background, which for $n_5=1$ imposes the constraint that our analysis has identified. Along the way, we construct a map between the supergroup formulation of the $n_5=1$ worldsheet theory and the more conventional RNS worldsheet formalism.</description>

Abstract: We study properties of non-topological solitons in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The spectrum of linear perturbations on these solutions is found to be trivial, containing only symmetry-related zero modes. The interpretation of this feature is given by considering the relativistic generalization of our theory in which the conformal symmetry is violated. It is explicitly seen that the restoration of this symmetry leads to the absence of decay/vibrational modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the photon-fermion one-particle irreducible vertex in QED in linear covariant gauges. The longitudinal component of this vertex is described using the Ball-Chiu basis, while its transverse part is expressed with the K{\i}z{\i}lersu-Reenders-Pennington basis. Combining the vertex Ward-Takahashi identity with the vertex equation, we derive a set of exact, non-linear integral equations governing the transverse vertex. These equations hold for any linear covariant gauge and must be solved self-consistently. We discuss several approximations to the exact equations, generalizing results previously obtained at the perturbative one-loop level. Various kinematical configurations are also examined. Furthermore, we compute the perturbative solution of the transverse vertex Dyson-Schwinger equations for all transverse form factors and derive their perturbative asymptotic expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of relativistic corrections for the study of the stability of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-topological solitons with quartic self-interaction in the low-energy limit. This result is explained by the restoration of conformal symmetry in the non-relativistic limit. Particularly, the corresponding cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation supports scale-free non-topological solitons. An unbroken conformal symmetry provides the additional degeneration that allows for the exact result for the energy and angular momentum of the stationary classical solutions. We study the violation of conformal symmetry by relativistic corrections. The emergence of exponentially growing modes on the classical background is demonstrated using analytical approximations and numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Markov Gaps and Entanglement Wedge Multiway Cuts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Markov gap, defined as the difference between reflected entropy and mutual information, serves as a diagnostic for quantum recoverability and multipartite entanglement. In holographic settings, it admits a geometric interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps. We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite structure in holographic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for effective field theories: cutoff schemes and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In effective field theories, the concept of renormalization of perturbative divergences is replaced by renormalization group concepts such as relevance and universality. Universality is related to cutoff scheme independence in renormalization. Three-dimensional scalar field theory with just the quartic coupling is universal but the less relevant sextic coupling introduces a cutoff scheme dependence, which we quantify by three independent parameters, in the two-loop order of perturbation theory. However, reasonable schemes only allow reduced ranges of those parameters, even contrasting the sharp cutoff with very smooth cutoffs. The sharp cutoff performs better. In any case, the effective field theory possesses some degree of universality even in the massive case (off criticality).</description>

      <title>Constraints on Long-Range Forces in De Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representation theory of de Sitter space admits partially massless (PM) particles, but whether such particles can participate in consistent interacting theories remains unclear. We investigate the consistency of theories containing PM fields, particularly when these fields are coupled to gravity. Our strategy exploits the fact that PM fields correspond to partially conserved currents on the spacetime boundary, which generate symmetries. These symmetries place stringent constraints on correlation functions of charged operators, allowing us to test the consistency of a proposed bulk spectrum. When the assumed operator content violates these constraints, the corresponding bulk theory is ruled out. Applying this framework, we show that, in four-dimensional de Sitter space, PM fields of spin 2 or 3 (at depth 0) cannot couple consistently to gravity: such couplings necessitate additional massive fields, which are inevitably non-unitary. In higher dimensions, however, the constraints can be satisfied without violating unitarity if further PM fields are included. The resulting structure leads to additional charge conservation laws, which suggests that consistency may ultimately require an infinite tower of higher-spin PM fields, akin to the situation for ordinary higher-spin symmetries. The methods developed here provide powerful constraints on possible long-range interactions in de Sitter space and delineate the landscape of consistent quantum field theories in cosmological spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Higher-form (Quasi)Hydrodynamics from Holography: Deformations and Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-energy dynamics of systems with exact and approximate higher-form symmetries using gauge/gravity duality. These symmetries are realised holographically via Maxwell-type theories for massless and massive $p$-forms in AlAdS spacetimes. Double-trace deformations of the boundary theory are considered. While massless theories describe systems with conserved higher-form current, the massive case provides a controlled linearised framework for explicit symmetry breaking induced by defects and charged operators. We perform holographic renormalisation and establish a unified holographic dictionary across a broad theory space, parametrised by spacetime dimension, form rank, quantisation scheme and deformation scale. We compute thermal correlation functions in isotropic black brane backgrounds to characterise the hydrodynamic and quasihydrodynamic regimes of the dual boundary theories. Our analysis reveals a rich structure of relaxation dynamics, emergent photons and duality relations -- including the conventional electric-magnetic Hodge duality and its massive counterpart. These results extend bottom-up holography to include weakly broken higher-form symmetries and open avenues for exploring generalised self-duality constraints and new classes of deformed holographic duals.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions and criticality for charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of spherically symmetric, charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gravitational thermodynamics of Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes can be extended by allowing for variations of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant. In the dual CFT this corresponds to including the central charge C and its chemical potential $\mu$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables. In addition, compared to Einstein's theory of gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity introduces higher-order curvature terms. The coupling constants of these higher-order curvature terms $\alpha$ can serve as new thermodynamic quantities, which will also be dual to thermodynamic quantities on the boundary CFT, a feature not present in the CFT dual to Einstein's gravity previously. Based on the holographic dictionary, we consider the critical behavior and phase transition phenomena of the CFT description of the charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in $d=4$ and $d=5$ in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$. We find that the conventional description of free energy cannot adequately describe the phase transitions and critical behavior of the CFT in this ensemble. This may stem from the fact that the constraints we have adopted are different from the conventional ones.</description>

      <title>Towards Nonperturbative Solution of Quantum Dynamics : A Hamiltonian Mean Field Approximation Scheme with Perturbation Theory for Arbitray Strength of Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.12508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non perturbative general approximation scheme (NGAS) that can handle interactions of any strength in quantum theory. This approach starts with an input Hamiltonian that can be solved exactly. The interaction effects are then built into this Hamiltonian through nonlinear feedback enforced by self consistency conditions. While the method itself is nonperturbative it can be systematically improved using a new perturbation method called 'mean field perturbation theory' which does not involve power series expansion in any small parameter. We put this scheme to the test on one dimensional anharmonic interactions using the harmonic approximation. The results are consistently accurate across various cases including quartic, sextic, and octic anharmonic oscillators, as well as the quartic double well oscillator (QDWO) even when the coupling strength varies widely. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated when we swap the input Hamiltonian for that of an infinite square well and still achieve comparable accuracy. When applied to the {\lambda}{\phi}4 quantum field theory this approach aligns with the Gaussian effective potential method under the harmonic approximation. Beyond that it reveals the condensate structure of the effective vacuum and highlights the instability of the perturbative ground state. Notably, our ground-state energy results for the QDWO stand in stark contrast to those from standard perturbation theory where Borel summation fails regardless of coupling strength.</description>

      <title>The emergence of Einstein gravity from topological supergravity in $3+1$D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological aspects of Einstein gravity suggest that topological invariance could be a more profound principle in understanding quantum gravity. In this work, we explore a topological supergravity action that initially describes a universe without Riemann curvature, which seems trivial. However, we made a surprising discovery by introducing a small deformation parameter $\lambda$, which can be regarded as an AdS generalization of supersymmetry (SUSY). We find that the deformed topological quantum field theory (TQFT) becomes unstable at low energy, resulting in the emergence of a classical metric, whose dynamics are controlled by the Einstein equation. Our findings suggest that a quantum theory of gravity could be governed by a UV fixed point of a SUSY TQFT, and classical spacetime ceases to exist beyond the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Background-dependent and classical correspondences between $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity are based on fundamentally different geometric frameworks, yet they exhibit many similar properties. This article provides a comprehensive summary and comparative analysis of the various theoretical branches of torsional gravity and non-metric gravity, which arise from different choices of affine connection. We identify two types of background-dependent and classical correspondences between these two theories of gravity. The first correspondence is established through their equivalence within the Minkowski spacetime background. To achieve this, we develop the tetrad-spin formulation of $f(Q)$ gravity and derive the corresponding expression for the spin connection. The second correspondence is based on the equivalence of their equations of motion. Utilizing a metric-affine approach, we derive the general affine connection for static and spherically symmetric spacetime in $f(Q)$ gravity and compare its equations of motion with those of $f(T)$ gravity. Among others, our results reveal that, $f(T)$ solutions are not simply a subset of $f(Q)$ solutions; rather, they encompass a complex solution beyond $f(Q)$ gravity in black hole background.</description>

Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency: the gravitational wave signal associated with the early inspiral stage of the binary and the non-linear gravitational wave memory. We compare the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors to these two contributions, with a particular interest in events with a merger phase at frequencies higher than the detector's peak sensitivity. We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. Our analysis incorporates the evolution history of primordial black hole binaries, key to accurately estimating the relevant event rates. We also discuss the waveform templates of the memory signal at ground- and space-based interferometers, and the implications for a matched filtering search. This allows us to compare the sensitivity of high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, sensitive to the merger phase, with the sensitivity of existing interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Are magnetic fields in cosmic voids primordial?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of magnetic fields in the voids of the large-scale structure of the Universe has been a multifaceted open puzzle for decades. On one hand, their origin is not clear with most of the magnetogenesis models using physics beyond the standard model in the early Universe, and on the other hand, their existence and potential role in explaining the spectra of TeV blazars have been intensely debated in the past decade. Here, we propose a mechanism, within classical electrodynamics, that could fill the voids with late-Universe fields and, under certain conditions, dispel the need for primordial fields altogether to explain the void fields. Specifically, we use the dipole component of the galactic fields to generate space-filling magnetic fields in voids with white-noise spectrum and sufficient amplitude to explain the lack of GeV halos around TeV blazars observed by Fermi-LAT. A definitive test for such fields in the voids will be the white-noise spectral shape, which will constrain possible plasma processes in the voids to the ones that allow for the propagation of these dipole fields into the voids.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generation from the vacuum of a scalar charged field in a rigidly rotating frame. Adding an external magnetic field opens the way to Bose condensation of the field. This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</description>

      <title>Universality of gravitational radiation from magnetar magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intense magnetic fields inferred from magnetars suggest they may be strong gravitational-wave emitters. Although emissions due to hydromagnetic deformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields also contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free energy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent relative to the potential state, implying that the magnetospheric contribution to the gravitational-wave luminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts 'universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the near-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents. Using a suite of three-dimensional, force-free, general-relativistic solutions for dipole and dipole-plus-quadrupole fields, we find that space-based interferometers may enable marginal detections out to $\lesssim$ kpc distances for slowly-rotating magnetars with fields of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G independently of internal deformations.</description>

      <title>Convergence in charmonium structure: light-front wave functions from basis light-front quantization and Dyson-Schwinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of charmonium light-front wave functions obtained through two complementary non-perturbative approaches: Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) and Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSE). Key observables include the charge form factor, gravitational form factors, light-cone distribution amplitudes, decay constants, and two-photon transition form factors. Despite their distinct theoretical foundations and model parameters, the predictions from BLFQ and DSE exhibit remarkable agreement across all observables. This convergence validates both frameworks for studying charmonium structure and highlights the complementary strengths of Hamiltonian-based -- BLFQ -- and Lagrangian-based -- DSE -- methods in addressing non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Localized five-dimensional rotating brane-world black hole Analytically Connected to an to an AdS$_5$ boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a method to describe the geometry of an analytic, exponentially localized $5D$ rotating braneworld black hole, using the $5D$ Janis Newman algorithm in Hopf coordinates. The induced metric on the brane matches the standard $4D$ Kerr spacetime. Two curvature singularities arise: one confined to the $3$-brane at $z = r = 0$, and another that, on the brane, reproduces the Kerr singularity at $r = 0$, $\bar{\theta} = \pi/2$. The inner and event horizons, together with the stationary limit hypersurfaces, extend into the extra dimension in a pancake-like shape. We describe their behavior in the bulk.
  The energy momentum tensor represents a source transitioning from an anisotropic, non diagonal structure to a vacuum with negative cosmological constant. Thus, the localized black hole connects to an AdS$_5$ boundary. The geometry is supported by a non-diagonal anisotropic fluid in the bulk, requiring no matter on the brane. To evaluate the energy conditions, we use a one form from the dual basis that yields a diagonal energy momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Could regular primordial black holes be dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent proposal proposed by Paul Davies and colleagues [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111} (2025) no.10, 103512] that regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) form stable, zero-temperature remnants and could thereby constitute dark matter is critically examined. While the introduction of a fundamental length scale indeed regulates the Hawking temperature, preventing its divergence, we show that the evaporation timescale for such RPBHs is infinite. This result holds generically for analytic regular black hole spacetimes under standard adiabatic and quasi-static evolution. Consequently, RPBHs never actually reach a true remnant state within any finite time, but instead persist as slowly evaporating objects with a non-zero luminosity. When the combined emission from a cosmological population of these near-remnants is considered, the resulting radiation is found to violate stringent observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background and extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds. Therefore, low-mass RPBHs are not viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration in a fast scrambling system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration -- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev model with a conserved U(1) charge. Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity, identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism. These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.</description>
