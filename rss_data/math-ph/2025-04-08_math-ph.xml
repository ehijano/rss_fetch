      <title>Charged particle motion in a strong magnetic field: Applications to plasma confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the zero order approximation of a charged particle under the influence of a strong magnetic field in a mathematically rigorous manner and clarify in which sense this approximation is valid. We use this to further rigorously derive a displacement formula for the pressure of plasma equilibria and compare our findings to results in the physics literature. The main novelty of our results is a qualitative estimate of the confinement time for optimised plasma equilibria with respect to the gyro frequency. These results are of interest in the context of plasma fusion confinement.</description>

      <title>Kernel and image of the Biot-Savart operator and their applications in stellarator designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Biot-Savart operator acting on $W^{-\frac{1}{2},2}$ regular, div-free, surface currents $j$ \begin{gather}
  \nonumber
  \operatorname{BS}(j)(x)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\Sigma}j(y)\times \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3}d\sigma(y)\text{, }x\in \Omega \end{gather} where $\Sigma$ is a connected surface to which $j$ is tangent and where $\Omega$ is the finite domain bounded by $\Sigma$.
  We answer two questions regarding this operator.
  i) We provide an algorithm which converges (theoretically) exponentially fast to an element of the kernel of the Biot-Savart operator, as well as characterise the elements of the kernel of the Biot-Savart operator in terms of certain solutions to exterior boundary value problems. This allows one to explicitly exploit the non-uniqueness of the coil reconstruction process in the context of stellarator designs.
  ii) We provide a simple, concise characterisation of the image of the Biot-Savart operator. This allows to define a 2-step current reconstruction procedure to obtain surface currents which approximate to arbitrary precision a prescribed target magnetic field within the plasma region of a stellarator device. The first step does not require computing integrals involving singular integral kernels of the form $\frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3}$ but may have a potentially slow convergence rate, while the second step requires the computation of integrals involving singular integral kernels but in turn has (theoretically) an exponential convergence rate. This approximation procedure always leads to approximating surface currents which are as poloidal as possible.</description>

      <title>Auxeticity of composite laminates made of specially orthotropic plies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the conditions for obtaining auxetic, i.e. with a negative Poisson's ratio, composite laminates made of specially orthotropic layers. In particular, the layers considered are of three types: R1-orthotropic, i.e. square-symmetric plies, like those reinforced by balanced fabrics, R0-orthotropic layers, like those that can be obtained with balanced fabrics having warp and weft forming an angle of 45 degrees, and finally r0-orthotropic layers, like common paper. All these types of orthotropy have mathematical and mechanical properties different by common orthotropy. As a consequence of this, the conditions of auxeticity for anisotropic composite laminates made of such special plies change from the more common case of unidirectional plies. These conditions are analyzed in this paper making use of the polar formalism, a mathematical method particularly suited for the study of two-dimensional anisotropic elasticity.</description>

      <title>Existence of abelian BPS vortices on surfaces with Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of abelian BPS vortices on a manifold with boundary satisfying Neumann boundary conditions is proved. Numeric solutions are constructed on the Euclidean disk, and the L^2-metric of the moduli space of one vortex located at the interior of a rotationally symmetry disk is studied. The results presented extend previous work of Manton and Zhao on quotients of surfaces that admit a reflection.</description>

      <title>On the Deformed Algebras Applications to Quantum Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some possible applications of deformed algebras to Quantum Physics are considered based on a rigorous approach. Jackson integrals are expressed in the context of the equipped separable Hilbert space. Jackson integrals are expressed in the context of the equipped separable Hilbert spaces using point measures where possible. Along the way, certain errors and/or inaccuracies made by different authors of the cited references have been corrected. A brief analysis at the end of the article indicates that there are still problems in applying deformed algebras to Quantum Mechanics and Field Theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fermi-Dirac Distribution of Exclusive Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of exclusive fermions occurs when two fermions of opposite spin are prohibited from occupying the same quantum level. We derive the distribution of exclusive fermions via the employment of the grand canonical ensemble. Salient features of its statistical properties, compared to the free electron gases, include: larger Fermi energy, higher degeneracy pressure, but the same Pauli paramagnetism and Landau diamagnetism. In particular, higher degeneracy pressure leads to an inflation of the Chandrasekhar limit to 1.6 times when applied to white dwarf stars and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with a commutative and associative product structure that encodes superintegrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06418v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that two natural and a priori unrelated structures encapsulate the same data, namely certain commutative and associative product structures and a class of superintegrable Hamiltonian systems. More precisely, consider a Euclidean space of dimension at least three, equipped with a commutative and associative product structure that satisfies the conditions of a Manin-Frobenius manifold, plus one additional compatibility condition. We prove that such a product structure encapsulates precisely the conditions of a so-called abundant structure. Such a structure provides the data needed to construct a family of second-order (maximally) superintegrable Hamiltonian systems of second order. We prove that all abundant superintegrable Hamiltonian systems on Euclidean space of dimension at least three arise in this way. As an example, we present the Smorodinski-Winternitz Hamiltonian system.</description>

      <title>BCFW tilings and cluster adjacency for the amplituhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2005, Britto, Cachazo, Feng and Witten gave a recurrence (now known as the BCFW recurrence) for computing scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang Mills theory. Arkani-Hamed and Trnka subsequently introduced the amplituhedron to give a geometric interpretation of the BCFW recurrence. Arkani-Hamed and Trnka conjectured that each way of iterating the BCFW recurrence gives a "triangulation" or "tiling" of the m=4 amplituhedron. In this article we prove the BCFW tiling conjecture of Arkani-Hamed and Trnka. We also prove the cluster adjacency conjecture for BCFW tiles of the amplituhedron, which says that facets of tiles are cut out by collections of compatible cluster variables for the Grassmannian Gr(4,n). Moreover we show that each BCFW tile is the subset of the Grassmannian where certain cluster variables have particular signs.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Discrete Series of SU(1,1): Orthogonality Relations, Character Formulas, and Multiplicities in Tensor Product Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SU$(1,1)$ group plays a fundamental role in various areas of physics, including quantum mechanics, quantum optics, and representation theory. In this work we revisit the holomorphic discrete series representations of SU$(1,1)$, with a focus on orthogonality relations for matrix elements, character formulas of unitary irreducible representations (UIRs), and the decomposition of tensor products of these UIRs. Special attention is given to the structure of these decompositions and the associated multiplicities, which are essential for understanding composite systems and interactions within SU$(1,1)$ symmetry frameworks. These findings offer deeper insights into the mathematical foundations of SU$(1,1)$ representations and their significance in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Physical significance of artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using clean numerical simulation (CNS) in which artificial numerical noise is negligible over a finite, sufficiently long interval of time, we provide evidence, for the first time, that artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence is approximately equivalent to thermal fluctuation and/or stochastic environmental noise. This confers physical significance on the artificial numerical noise of DNS of the Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, DNS on a fine mesh should correspond to turbulence under small internal/external physical disturbance, whereas DNS on a sparse mesh corresponds to turbulent flow under large physical disturbance, respectively. The key point is that: all of them have physical meanings and so are correct in terms of their deterministic physics, even if their statistics are quite different. This is illustrated herein. Our paper provides a positive viewpoint regarding the presence of artificial numerical noise in DNS.</description>

Abstract: We consider an equidistant array of disjoint potential wells in $\mathbb{R}^\nu,\: \nu\ge 2$, built over a straight line, and show that, under a restriction on the potential support aspect ratio, a perturbation consisting of longitudinal shifts of a finite number of them preserving the disjointness gives rise to a nonempty discrete spectrum below the threshold of the lowest spectral band.</description>

      <title>Tunneling time in non-Hermitian space fractional quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tunneling time of a wave packet propagating through a non-Hermitian potential $V_{r} - iV_{i}$ in space-fractional quantum mechanics. By applying the stationary phase method, we derive a closed-form expression for the tunneling time for this system. This study presents the first investigation of tunneling time at the interplay of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and space-fractional quantum mechanics. The variation in tunneling time as the system transitions from a real to a complex potential is analyzed. We demonstrate that the tunneling time exhibits a dependence on the barrier width $d$ in the limit $d\rightarrow \infty$, showing the absence of the Hartman effect. A particularly striking feature of our findings is the potential manifestation of the Hartman effect for a specific combination of the absorption component $V_{i}$ and the Levy index $\alpha$. This behavior arises from the fact that the presence of the absorption component $V_{i}$ leads to a monotonic increase in tunneling time with barrier thickness, whereas the Levy index $\alpha$ reduces the tunneling time. The interplay of these contrasting influences facilitates the emergence of the Hartman effect under a specific combination of $V_{i}$ and the fractional parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points and Universality Classes in Coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studied are coupled KPZ equations with three control parameters $X,Y,T$. These equations are used in the context of stretched polymers in a random medium, for the spacetime spin-spin correlator of the isotropic quantum Heisenberg chain, and for exciton-polariton condensates. In an earlier article we investigated merely the diagonal $X=Y$, $T=1$. Then the stationary measure is delta-correlated Gaussian and the dynamical exponent equals $z = \tfrac{3}{2}$. We observed that the scaling functions of the dynamic correlator change smoothly when varying $X$. In this contribution, the analysis is extended to the whole $X$-$Y$-$T$ plane. Solutions are stable only if $XY \geq 0$. Based on numerical simulations, the static correlator still has rapid decay. We argue that the parameter space is foliated into distinct universality classes. They are labeled by $X$ and consist of half-planes parallel to the $Y$-$T$ plane containing the point $(X,X,1)$.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical limit of orthonormal Strichartz estimates on scattering manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum and classical correspondence related to the Strichartz estimates. First we consider the orthonormal Strichartz estimates on manifolds with ends. Under the nontrapping condition we prove the global-in-time estimates on manifolds with asymptotically conic ends or with asymptotically hyperbolic ends. Then we show that, for a class of pseudodifferential operators including the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the scattering manifolds, such estimates imply the global-in-time Strichartz estimates for the kinetic transport equations in the semiclassical limit. As a byproduct we prove that the existence of a periodic stable geodesic breaks the orthonormal Strichartz estimates. In the proof we do not need any quasimode. As an application we show the small data scattering for the cutoff Boltzmann equation on nontrapping scattering manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances, including gravitational wave detections and imaging of black hole shadows, have strongly validated general relativity. Nevertheless, ongoing cosmological observations suggest potential limitations of general relativity, spurring interest in modified theories of gravity. This study explores Lorentz gauge theory, an alternative gravitational framework offering promising solutions to longstanding conceptual issues in quantum gravity and cosmology. By analyzing black hole shadow structures and gravitational lensing effects-both weak and strong deflection regimes-we highlight unique observational signatures of Lorentz gauge gravity. Our findings provide valuable tools for future observational tests, potentially distinguishing these modified gravity models from general relativity and advancing our understanding of spacetime geometry and fundamental gravitational interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model of oscillatory chains that generalizes the contour discrete model of Buslaev nets. The model offers a continuous description of conflicts in system dynamics, interpreted as interactions between neighboring oscillators when their phases lie within defined interaction sectors. The size of the interaction sector can be seen as a measure of vehicle density within clusters moving along contours. The model assumes that oscillators can synchronize their dynamics, using concepts inherited from the Kuramoto model, which effectively accounts for the discrete state effects observed in Buslaev nets. The governing equation for oscillator dynamics incorporates four key factors: deceleration caused by conflicts with neighboring oscillators and the synchronization process, which induces additional acceleration or deceleration. Numerical analysis shows that the system exhibits both familiar properties from classic Buslaev nets, such as metastable synchronization, and novel behaviors, including phase transitions as the interaction sector size changes.</description>

      <title>GPU-based compressible lattice Boltzmann simulations on non-uniform grids using standard C++ parallelism: From best practices to aerodynamics, aeroacoustics and supersonic flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, designing accurate, robust, and efficient lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) on non-uniform grids with seamless GPU acceleration remains challenging. This work introduces a novel strategy using simple yet effective components: (1) parallel algorithms in modern C++, (2) conservative cell-centered grid refinement, (3) local boundary conditions, and (4) robust collision models. Our framework supports multiple lattices (D2Q9, D2Q13, D2Q21, D2Q37) chosen based on flow conditions. It includes collision models with polynomial and numerical equilibria, a second distribution for polyatomic behavior, a Jameson-like shock sensor, and relies on a generalization of Rohde's refinement strategy. Validation spans diverse benchmarks: lid-driven cavity flows, Aeolian noise, 30P30N airfoil aerodynamics, inviscid Riemann problems, and viscous flows past a NACA airfoil in transonic and supersonic regimes. Beyond its accuracy and stability, the portability of modern C++ leads to GPU-native performance while ensuring high modularity and ease of implementation. On non-uniform grids, weakly compressible LBMs achieve state-of-the-art GPU efficiency, and fully compressible LBMs benefit from GPU acceleration equivalent to thousands of CPU cores in the most compute-intensive cases. On top of this, our advanced performance models incorporate neighbor-list and asynchronous time-stepping effects which provide new insights into the performance decomposition of LB simulations on non-uniform grids. Overall, this study sets a new standard for portable, tree-based LBMs, demonstrating that a combination of simple, well-chosen components can achieve high performance, accuracy, and robustness across a wide range of flow conditions. As a final proof-of-concept, adaptive mesh refinement is proposed for subsonic and supersonic applications.</description>

      <title>Capturing AI's Attention: Physics of Repetition, Hallucination, Bias and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a first-principles physics theory of the AI engine at the heart of LLMs' 'magic' (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude): the basic Attention head. The theory allows a quantitative analysis of outstanding AI challenges such as output repetition, hallucination and harmful content, and bias (e.g. from training and fine-tuning). Its predictions are consistent with large-scale LLM outputs. Its 2-body form suggests why LLMs work so well, but hints that a generalized 3-body Attention would make such AI work even better. Its similarity to a spin-bath means that existing Physics expertise could immediately be harnessed to help Society ensure AI is trustworthy and resilient to manipulation.</description>

Abstract: We prove constant degree polynomial algorithms cannot optimize pure spherical $p$-spin Hamiltonians beyond the algorithmic threshold $\mathsf{ALG}(p)=2\sqrt{\frac{p-1}{p}}$. The proof goes by transforming any hypothetical such algorithm into a Lipschitz one, for which hardness was shown previously by the author and B. Huang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness of topological phases on aperiodic lattices by constructing *-homomorphisms from the groupoid model to the coarse-geometric model of observable C*-algebras. These *-homomorphisms induce maps in K-theory and Kasparov theory. We show that the strong topological phases in the groupoid model are detected by position spectral triples. We show that topological phases coming from stacking along another Delone set are always weak in the coarse-geometric sense.</description>

      <title>Approach to optimal quantum transport via states over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We approach the problem of constructing a quantum analogue of the immensely fruitful classical transport cost theory of Monge from a new angle. Going back to the original motivations, by which the transport is a bilinear function of a mass distribution (without loss of generality a probability density) and a transport plan (a stochastic kernel), we explore the quantum version where the mass distribution is generalised to a density matrix, and the transport plan to a completely positive and trace preserving map.
  These two data are naturally integrated into their Jordan product, which is called state over time (``stote''), and the transport cost is postulated to be a linear function of it.
  We explore the properties of this transport cost, as well as the optimal transport cost between two given states (simply the minimum cost over all suitable transport plans). After that, we analyse in considerable detail the case of unitary invariant cost, for which we can calculate many costs analytically. These findings suggest that our quantum transport cost is qualitatively different from Monge's classical transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate geometric aspects of the space of densities by analyzing transport along paths generated by quantum Markovian semigroups and more generally locally Markovian, or time-dependent Lindbladian, dynamics. Motivated by practical constraints, we also consider a more realistic scenario in which only a restricted set of Lindbladian generators is available. We study the corresponding transitivity properties and characterize the set of states that can be reached using such limited dynamical resources.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation in the flow approach for singular SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the renormalisation of singular SPDEs in the flow approach recently developed by Duch using a bottom-up setting. We introduce a general ansatz based on decorated trees for the solution of the flow equation. The ansatz is renormalised in a recursive way, in the sense of the trees, via local extractions introduced for regularity structures. We derive the renormalised equation from this ansatz and show that the renormalisation scheme is identical to that appearing in the context of regularity structures, thus matching the BPHZ renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Deformation of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra and the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}\left( {1|2} \right)$: exact solution for the quantum harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new deformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator Heisenberg-Weyl algebra with a parameter $a&gt;-1$. This parameter is introduced through the replacement of the homogeneous mass $m_0$ in the definition of the momentum operator $\hat p_x$ as well as in the creation-annihilation operators $\hat a^\pm$ with a mass varying with position $x$. The realization of such a deformation is shown through the exact solution of the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation for the non-relativistic quantum harmonic oscillator within the canonical approach. The obtained analytical expression of the energy spectrum consists of an infinite number of equidistant levels, whereas the wavefunctions of the stationary states of the problem under construction are expressed through the Hermite polynomials. Then, the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra deformation is generalized to the case of the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}\left( {1|2} \right)$. It is shown that the realization of such a generalized superalgebra can be performed for the parabose quantum harmonic oscillator problem, the mass of which possesses a behavior completely overlapping with the position-dependent mass of the canonically deformed harmonic oscillator problem. This problem is solved exactly for both even and odd stationary states. It is shown that the energy spectrum of the deformed parabose oscillator is still equidistant, however, both even and odd state wavefunctions are now expressed through the Laguerre polynomials. Some basic limit relations recovering the canonical harmonic oscillator with constant mass are also discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>On Separation of Variables for Symmetric Spaces of Rank1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study existence and nonexistence of diagonal and separating coordinates for Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank 1. We generalize the results of Gauduchon and Moroianu, 2020, by showing that a symmetric space of rank 1 has diagonal coordinates if and only if it has constant sectional curvature. This implies that orthogonal separation of variables on a symmetric space of rank 1 is possible only in the constant sectional curvature case. We show that on the complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^n$ and on complex hyperbolic space $\mathbb{C}H^n$, with $n\ge 2$, separating coordinates necessarily have precisely $n$ ignorable coordinates.
  In view of results of Boyer et al, 1983 and 1985, and later results of Winternitz et al, 1994, this completes the description of separation of variables on $\mathbb{C}P^n$ for all $n$ and on $\mathbb{C}H^n$ for $n=2,3$.</description>

      <title>Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain the recent results regarding the displacement memory effect (DME) of plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel approach stems from the fact that both geodesic and Schr\"odinger equations are Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for P\"oschl-Teller and Scarf profiles and restores the critical values of wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which shows the broader applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>On multipolar magnetic anomaly detection: multipolar signal subspaces, an analytical orthonormal basis, multipolar truncature and detection performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the magnetic anomaly detection problem which aims to find hidden ferromagnetic masses by estimating the weak perturbation they induce on local Earth's magnetic field. We consider classical detection schemes that rely on signals recorded on a moving sensor, and modeling of the source as a function of unknown parameters. As the usual spherical harmonic decomposition of the anomaly has to be truncated in practice, we study the signal vector subspaces induced by each multipole of the decomposition, proving they are not in direct sum, and discussing the impact it has on the choice of the truncation order. Further, to ease the detection strategy based on generalized likelihood ratio test, we rely on orthogonal polynomials theory to derive an analytical set of orthonormal functions (multipolar orthonormal basis functions) that spans the space of the noise-free measured signal. Finally, based on the subspace structure of the multipole vector spaces, we study the impact of the truncation order on the detection performance, beyond the issue of potential surparametrization, and the behaviour of the information criteria used to choose this order.</description>

      <title>Non-local charges from perturbed defects via SymTFT in 2d CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional conformal field theories from the point of view of the 3d SymTFT of the unperturbed theory. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which results in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations, such that the perturbed line defects are conserved in the perturbed CFT. In other words, the perturbed defects are rigidly translation invariant, and such defects form a monoidal category which extends the topological symmetries. As examples we study the A-type Virasoro minimal models $M(p,q)$. Our formalism provides one-parameter families of commuting non-local conserved charges for perturbations by a primary bulk field with Kac label $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, or $(1,5)$, which are the standard integrable perturbations of minimal models. We find solutions to the commutation condition also for other bulk perturbations, such as $(1,7)$, and we contrast this with the existence of local conserved charges. There has been recent interest in the possibility that in certain cases perturbations by fields such as $(1,7)$ can be integrable, and our construction provides a new way in which integrability can be found without the need for local conserved charges.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the consistency of character expansion for the Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) model in terms of Schur polynomials with the old formulas for pair correlators with the IZ measure. The non-symmetrical structure of the correlators led us to derive an ansatz for the decomposition of the differentiated Schur polynomials to calculate all the pair correlators. This opens a new way to study arbitrary IZ correlators of any order in character expansion.</description>

      <title>Signature change by a morphism of spectral triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05839v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a connection between twisted spectral triples and pseudo-Riemannian spectral triples, rooted in the fundamental interplay between twists and Krein products. A concept of morphism of spectral triples is introduced, transforming one spectral triple into its dual. In the case of even-dimensional manifolds, we demonstrate how this construction implements a local signature change via the parity operator induced by the twist. Consequently, the signature change transformation is governed solely by the unitary operator that implements the twist. This unitary is a central element of our approach, as it is directly linked to the Krein product, the twist, and the parity operator that implements the signature change.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one- and two-dimensional periodic tight-binding models under the presence of a potential that grows to infinity in one direction, hence preventing the particles to escape in this direction (the soft wall). We prove that a spectral flow appears in these corresponding edge models, as the wall is shifted. We identity this flow as a number of Bloch bands, and provide a lower bound for the number of edge states appearing in such models.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger Equations of Quartic Matrix Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix field theory is a combinatorially non-local field theory which has recently been found to be a non-trivial but solvable QFT example. To generalize such non-perturbative structures to other models, a more combinatorial understanding of Dyson-Schwinger equations and their solutions is of high interest. To this end we consider combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations manifestly relying on the Hopf-algebraic structure of perturbative renormalization. We find that these equations are fully compatible with renormalization, relying only on the superficially divergent diagrams which are planar ribbon graphs, i.e. decompleted dual combinatorial maps. Still, they are of a similar kind as in realistic models of local QFT, featuring in particular an infinite number of primitive diagrams as well as graph-dependent combinatorial factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spectral properties of the quantum Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy defined by Buryak and Rossi. We prove that eigenvalues to first order in the dispersion parameter are given by shifted symmetric functions. The proof is based on the boson-fermion correspondence and an analysis of quartic expressions in fermions. As an application, we obtain a closed evaluation of certain double Hodge integrals on the moduli spaces of curves. Finally, we provide an explicit formula for the eigenvectors to first order in the dispersion parameter. In particular, we show that its Schur expansion is supported on partitions for which the Hamming distance is minimal.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Perspective on Kinetic Matter-Radiation Interaction and Moment Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a geometric perspective on the kinetic interaction of matter and radiation, based on a pair bracket approach. We discuss the interaction of kinetic theories via dissipative brackets, with our fundamental example being the coupling of matter, described by the Boltzmann equation, and radiation, described by the radiation transport equation. We explore the transition from kinetic systems to their corresponding moment systems, provide a Hamiltonian description of such moment systems, and give a geometric interpretation of the moment closure problem for kinetic theories. As an application, we discuss in detail diffusion radiation hydrodynamics as an example of a pair bracket formulation on a space of moments corresponding to kinetic matter-radiation interaction. Additionally, using the variable moment closure framework of Burby (2023), we show how to construct Hamiltonian moment closures for kinetic transport equations with arbitrary Hamiltonian. Using this general construction, we derive novel Hamiltonian moment closures for pure radiation transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article demonstrates how the transition from a twisted spectral triple to a pseudo-Riemannian spectral triple arises within an almost-commutative spectral triple. This suggests that the noncommutative part itself is responsible for the signature change. This opens a new perspective on the Lorentzian signature problem, suggesting that the almost-commutative structure at the heart of the noncommutative standard model of particle physics could be the origin of the emergence of a Lorentzian spectral triple, starting from self-adjoint Dirac operators and conventional inner product structures, within the framework of twisted spectral triples.</description>

      <title>Notes on fundamental algebraic supergeometry. Hilbert and Picard superschemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.00700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes aim at providing a complete and systematic account of some foundational aspects of algebraic supergeometry, namely, the extension to the geometry of superschemes of many classical notions, techniques and results that make up the general backbone of algebraic geometry, most of them originating from Grothendieck's work. In particular, we extend to algebraic supergeometry such notions as projective and proper morphisms, finiteness of the cohomology, vector and projective bundles, cohomology base change, semicontinuity theorems, relative duality, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, flattening, Hilbert and Quot schemes, faithfully flat descent, quotient \'etale relations (notably, Picard schemes), among others. Some results may be found elsewhere, and, in particular, there is some overlap with a recent preprint by Moosavian and Zhou. However, many techniques and constructions are presented here for the first time, notably, a first development of Grothendieck relative duality for proper morphisms of superschemes, the construction of the Hilbert superscheme in a more general situation than the one already known (which in particular allows one to treat the case of sub-superschemes of supergrassmannians), and a rigorous construction of the Picard superscheme for a locally superprojective morphism of noetherian superschemes with geometrically integral fibres. Moreover, some of the proofs given here are new as well, even when restricted to ordinary schemes. In a final section we construct a period map from an open substack of the moduli of proper and smooth supercurves to the moduli stack of principally polarized abelian superchemes.</description>

Abstract: We study Bregman divergences in probability density space embedded with the $L^2$-Wasserstein metric. Several properties and dualities of transport Bregman divergences are provided. In particular, we derive the transport Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence by a Bregman divergence of negative Boltzmann-Shannon entropy in $L^2$-Wasserstein space. We also derive analytical formulas and generalizations of transport KL divergence for one-dimensional probability densities and Gaussian families.</description>

      <title>Towards Super-polynomial Quantum Speedup of Equivariant Quantum Algorithms with SU($d$) Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework of the equivariant convolutional quantum algorithms which is tailored for a number of machine-learning tasks on physical systems with arbitrary SU$(d)$ symmetries. It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) [Quantum Inf. Comput., 10, 470-497 (2010)] -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.</description>

      <title>Large-scale dispersive estimates for acoustic operators: homogenization meets localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work relates quantitatively homogenization to Anderson localization for acoustic operators in disordered media. By blending dispersive estimates for homogenized operators and quantitative homogenization of the wave equation, we derive large-scale dispersive estimates for waves in disordered media that we apply to the spreading of low-energy eigenstates. This gives a short and direct proof that the lower spectrum of the acoustic operator is purely absolutely continuous in case of periodic media, and it further provides new lower bounds on the localization length of possible eigenstates in case of quasiperiodic or random media.</description>

      <title>Operads and the Markov Property on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov processes on the lattices with arbitrary dimension are omnipresent in statistical mechanics; however their algebraic description is complete only in dimension 1, for which linear algebra provides many tools complementary to the probabilistic approach: as an example, invariant measures are eigenvectors of the generator. In larger dimension, such algebraic tools are absent due to the more involved structure of boundaries. The present work fills this gap by providing a new and complete algebraic description of these models without any other assumption than the Markov property. In order to handle higher dimensions and higher products, the language of operads is used in order to focus on associativities and the geometric interpretation of the algebraic products. This formalism leads to a new parametrization of boundary conditions of Markov processes, with concrete computations. This parametrization is inspired matrix product states in the physics literature. Among others, a probabilistic application elaborated in this paper is the construction of translation-invariant infinite-volume Gibbs measures on the whole lattice by using Kolmogorov's extension; this provides a new alternative tool to the traditional analytical approaches of large size limits. Various models are considered as illustrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the 2d directed polymer in random environment in a novel *quasi-critical regime*, which interpolates between the much studied sub-critical and critical regimes. We prove Edwards-Wilkinson fluctuations throughout the quasi-critical regime, showing that the diffusively rescaled partition functions are asymptotically Gaussian. We deduce a corresponding result for the critical 2d Stochastic Heat Flow. A key challenge is the lack of hypercontractivity, which we overcome deriving new moment estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras II: Convergence of Sewing and Higher Genus Pseudo-$q$-traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We prove the convergence of Segal's sewing of conformal blocks associated to analytic families of pointed compact Riemann surfaces and grading-restricted generalized $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules (where $N=1,2,\dots$) that are not necessarily tensor products of $\mathbb V$-modules, generalizing significantly the results on convergence in [Gui23].
  We show that ``higher genus pseudo-$q$-traces" (called pseudo-sewing in this article) can be recovered from Segal's sewing. Therefore, our result on the convergence of Segal's sewing implies the convergence of pseudo-sewing, and hence covers both the convergence of genus-$0$ sewing in [HLZ12] and the convergence of pseudo-$q$-traces in [Miy04] and [Fio16].
  Using a similar method, we also prove the convergence of Virasoro uniformization, i.e., the convergence of conformal blocks deformed by non-automomous meromorphic vector fields near the marked points. The local freeness of the analytic sheaves of conformal blocks is a consequence of this convergence. It will be used in the third paper of this series to prove the sewing-factorization theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the number of integrals required to define differential equations for the wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat space amplitudes. After demonstrating the validity of our construction using intersection theory, we develop simple graphical rules for cut tubings that enumerate the space of physical cuts and, consequently, differential forms without any calculation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Robustness and Fragility of Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Superspace and Bloch Electron Systems with Zeeman Effects: *-Bracket Formalism for Super Curtright-Zachos Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>Fisher Information in Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes review the theory of Fisher information, especially its use in kinetic theory of gases and plasmas. The recent monotonicity theorem by Guillen--Silvestre for the Landau--Coulomb equation is put in perspective and generalised. Following my joint work with Imbert and Silvestre, it is proven that Fisher information is decaying along the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, for all relevant interactions, and from this the once longstanding problem of regularity estimates for very singular collision kernels (very soft potentials) is solved.</description>

      <title>On string functions of the generalized parafermionic theories, mock theta functions, and false theta functions, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations as a conjectural classification of all modular-invariant representations of the affine Kac--Moody algebras. For the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_1^{(1)}$ their conjectural construction has been proved. Using their construction, Ahn, Chung, and Tye introduced the generalized Fateev--Zamolodchikov parafermionic theories. The characters of these parafermionic theories are string functions of admissible representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ up to a simple appropriate factor. Determining modular properties or explicitly calculating string functions and branching coefficients is an important yet wide-open problem. Outside of initial works of Kac, Peterson, and Wakimoto, little is known. Here we take a new approach by first developing a quasi-periodic notion of admissible string functions and then calculating the Zagier--Zwegers' polar-finite decomposition for the admissible characters. As an application of the decomposition, we extend the results of our paper (Borozenets and Mortenson, 2024) for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_1^{(1)}$, in that we obtain families of new mock theta conjecture-like identities for $1/3$ and $2/3$-level string functions in terms of Ramanujan's mock theta functions $f_3(q)$ and $\omega_3(q)$. We also obtain an analogous family of new identities for the $1/5$-level string functions in terms of Ramanujan's four tenth-order mock theta functions. In addition, we give a heuristic argument for an expansion of the general positive-level admissible string functions in terms of Appell functions.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable multicomponent spinless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalising the one to one correspondence between exactly solvable hermitian matrices $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}^\dagger$ and exactly solvable spinless fermion systems $\mathcal{H}_f=\sum_{x,y}c_x^\dagger\mathcal{H}(x,y)c_y$, four types of exactly solvable multicomponent fermion systems are constructed explicitly. They are related to the multivariate Krawtcouk, Meixner and two types of Rahman like polynomials, constructed recently by myself. The Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are the eigenvectors of certain real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ which are related to the difference equations governing them. The corresponding fermions have nearest neighbour interactions. The Rahman like polynomials are eigenvectors of certain reversible Markov chain matrices $\mathcal{K}$, from which real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ are uniquely defined by the similarity transformation in terms of the square root of the stationary distribution. The fermions have wide range interactions.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation transition in the Wigner minor process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Wigner minor process, i.e. the eigenvalues of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix $H^{(N)}$ together with the eigenvalues of all its $n\times n$ minors, $H^{(n)}$, $n\le N$. The top eigenvalues of $H^{(N)}$ and those of its immediate minor $H^{(N-1)}$ are very strongly correlated, but this correlation becomes weaker for smaller minors $H^{(N-k)}$ as $k$ increases. For the GUE minor process the critical transition regime around $k\sim N^{2/3}$ was analyzed by Forrester and Nagao (J. Stat. Mech.: Theory and Experiment, 2011) providing an explicit formula for the nontrivial joint correlation function. We prove that this formula is universal, i.e. it holds for the Wigner minor process. Moreover, we give a complete analysis of the sub- and supercritical regimes both for eigenvalues and for the corresponding eigenvector overlaps, thus we prove the decorrelation transition in full generality.</description>

      <title>Diamond of triads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The triad refers to embedding of two systems of polynomials, symmetric ones and those of the Baker-Akhiezer type into a power series of the Noumi-Shiraishi type. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory and its extensions. The basic triad is associated with the vector representation of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. We discuss lifting this triad to two elliptic generalizations and further to the bi-elliptic triad. At the algebraic level, it corresponds to elliptic and bi-elliptic DIM algebras. This completes the list of polynomials associated with Seiberg-Witten theory with adjoint matter in various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Feynman integrals at large loop order and the $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find empirically that the value of Feynman integrals follows a $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution at large loop order. This result opens up a new avenue towards the large-order behavior in perturbative quantum field theory. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 17 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we discuss the extrapolation of this contribution to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{Symdyn}$: an automated algebraic solution for high-order quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many significant quantum physical systems are characterized by Hamiltonians expressible as a linear combination of time-independent generators of a closed Lie algebra, $\hat{H}(t)=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\eta_{l}(t)\hat{g}_{l}$. The Wei-Norman method provides a framework for determining the coefficients of the corresponding time evolution operator in its factorized representation, $\hat{U}(t) = \prod_{l=1}^{L} e^{ \Lambda_{l}(t)\hat{g}_{l}}$. This work introduces $\texttt{Symdyn}$, a Python library that automates the application of this method. The library efficiently computes similarity transformations and the nonlinear differential equations intrinsic to derive Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff-like relations and the time evolution of high-order quantum systems ($L\geq 6$). We demonstrate its robustness by deriving the time evolution operator for a system of two time-dependent coupled harmonic oscillators. Additionally, we specialize the library to the Lie group $\textit{SU}(N)$, showing its versatility with $\textit{SU}(2)$, $\textit{SU}(3)$ and $\textit{SU}(4)$ examples, relevant to quantum computing.</description>

      <title>CLT for LES of correlated Non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices such that the $ij$th entry of one matrix is correlated with the $ij$th entry of the other matrix. However, the entries of any particular matrix are i.i.d. random variables. We study the asymptotic behavior of the combined spectrum, and the limit of the linear eigenvalue statistic defined on the combined spectrum. We show that if the random variables are centered with variance $1/n$ and having finite moments, then the centered \textit{Linear Eigenvalue Statistics} (LESs) converge jointly to a bivariate Gaussian distribution. We assumed that the test function used in the LES belongs to Sobolev $H^{2+\delta}$ space. The variance of the limiting Gaussian distribution depends on correlation structure of the matrix entries and the fourth order mixed cumulants of the matrix entries. This generalizes the previous results by Rider, Silverstein (2006), Cipolloni, Erd\H{o}s, Schr\"oder (2023). In particular, we obtain the limiting LES of random centrosymmetric matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of the Frustrated Potts Model with Next-Nearest-Neighbor Interactions in One Dimension: An AI-Aided Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ $q$-state Potts model is solved exactly for arbitrary $q$ by introducing the maximally symmetric subspace (MSS) method to analytically block diagonalize the $q^2\times q^2$ transfer matrix to a simple $2\times 2$ matrix, based on using OpenAI's latest reasoning model o3-mini-high to exactly solve the $q=3$ case. It is found that the model can be mapped to the 1D $q$-state Potts model with $J_2$ acting as the nearest-neighbor interaction and $J_1$ as an effective magnetic field, extending the previous proof for $q=2$, i.e., the Ising model. The exact results provide insights to outstanding physical problems such as the stacking of atomic or electronic orders in layered materials and the formation of a $T_c$-dome-shaped phase often seen in unconventional superconductors. This work is anticipated to fuel both the research in one-dimensional frustrated magnets for recently discovered finite-temperature application potentials and the fast moving topic area of AI for sciences.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem:
  Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$
  We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is strongly finite and rigid.</description>

      <title>Subordination based approximation of Caputo fractional propagator and related numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an exponentially convergent numerical method for the Caputo fractional propagator $S_\alpha(t)$ and the associated mild solution of the Cauchy problem with time-independent sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2)$ in time. The proposed methods are constructed by generalizing the earlier developed approximation of $S_\alpha(t)$ with help of the subordination principle. Such technique permits us to eliminate the dependence of the main part of error estimate on $\alpha$, while preserving other computationally relevant properties of the original approximation: native support for multilevel parallelism, the ability to handle initial data with minimal spatial smoothness, and stable exponential convergence for all $t \in [0, T]$. Ultimately, the use of subordination leads to a significant improvement of the method's convergence behavior, particularly for small $\alpha &lt; 0.5$, and opens up further opportunities for efficient data reuse. To validate theoretical results, we consider applications of the developed methods to the direct problem of solution approximation, as well as to the inverse problem of fractional order identification.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this "wrong sign" requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called "charge neutrality condition". Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero.</description>
