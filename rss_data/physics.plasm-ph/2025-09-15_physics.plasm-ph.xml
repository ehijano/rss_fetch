      <title>The growth of magnetic energy during the nonlinear phase of the subsonic and supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify magnetic fields in turbulent plasmas. Theory predicts nonlinear magnetic energy growth $E_\mathrm{mag} \propto t^{p_\mathrm{nl}}$, but this scaling has not been tested across flow regimes. Using a large ensemble of SSD simulations spanning sub- to supersonic turbulence, we find linear growth ($p_\mathrm{nl} = 1$) in subsonic flows and quadratic growth ($p_\mathrm{nl} = 2$) in supersonic flows. In all cases, we find a dynamo efficiency of $\sim 1/100$ and a duration $\Delta t \approx 20\,t_0$, with $t_0$ the turnover time, establishing the universal timescales and efficiencies of the nonlinear SSD across astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Helical Field-Driven Translational-Rotational Conversion in Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of a new magnetodynamic effect describing the energy exchange between the degrees of freedom of a conducting cylinder moving in a helical magnetic field has been developed. The possibility of effectively converting the translational motion of the cylinder into its angular rotation around the system axis (translational-rotational conversion, TRC) has been demonstrated. A connection between this effect and the formation of helical trajectories of electrons in undulators in free electron lasers (FELs) and the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) has been revealed. In TRC, unlike many known effects associated with the interaction of a moving conductor with a magnetic field, the conductor has no electrical contact with any external circuit, which makes it especially attractive for various applications. The TRC is also possible in a magnetohydrodynamic flow moving along the axis of a helical magnetic field. The theory is formulated in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers, which corresponds to a sufficiently fast motion of well-conducting objects. In this scenario, the dynamics of the system is described by a nonlinear pendulum equation or a nonlinear pendulum equation with a nonzero right-hand side. In the latter case, a system dynamic mode corresponding to phase lock can be implemented.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of electron correlation models in warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report X-ray Thomson scattering measurements of warm dense aluminium at densities 3.75-4.5 g/cm$^3$ and a temperature of approximately 0.6 eV, performed at the HED-HiBEF instrument of the European XFEL using the DiPOLE-100X drive laser. By probing plasmon dispersion across momentum transfers $k$ = 0.99-2.57 Angstrom$^{-1}$ with high statistical fidelity, we directly test competing theories of electron dynamics under extreme conditions. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) reproduces both the observed plasmon energies and spectral shapes across the full $k$ range, whereas the random phase approximation (RPA) and static local-field-correction (LFC) models systematically overestimate the plasmon frequency, even for aluminium (a canonical uniform electron gas metal). Considering electron localisation around ions and the loss of crystalline symmetry due to liquid-state disorder, our measurements provide direct evidence that simple uniform electron gas models fail in warm dense matter and establish TDDFT as a reliable approach for electronic correlations in this regime.</description>

      <title>Technical Aspects of Plasma Operational Simulation (POPSIM): A Framework for Data-Driven Simulation and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on technical aspects of Plasma Operational Simulation (POPSIM), a research framework for data-driven simulation and control built in the machine learning framework JAX. The objective of the project is to address the extremely challenging simulation and modeling requirements of tokamak operations and control by combining simple principles-based models with data-driven models, spanning everything from power laws to new neural network architectures. This paper reports on key software and operations problems that the framework addresses, with examples from ongoing modeling activities for illustration.</description>

      <title>Power coupled to the slow wave resonance cone in cold plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the power coupled to the plasma from a cylindrical source emitting resonance cones, propagative slow waves which exist in low density magnetized plasmas when the signs of the Stix parameters S and P differ. In this work, we calculate this power for the first time for any collisionality, and show that it remains finite in the cold collisionless limit, even as the radiofrequency electric field itself, and the associated power absorption density, is singular. We give the main parameter dependencies of the coupled power.</description>

      <title>The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Inner crust of neutron stars: Polymorphism and superconductivity in the liquid drop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the liquid drop model built up with the nuclear interaction parametrization Sk$\chi$450, which is based on the chiral effective field theory, we calculate numerically the internal energy density for each of nuclear pasta phases and for the uniform nuclear matter. We provide quantitative arguments in favor of coexistence of various nuclear matter phases at a significant range of total pressure within the inner crust of neutron stars, a concept known as crystal polymorphism. Specifically, we find that differences of the internal energy per baryon for various phases are typically less than the thermal energy per a freedom degree at temperature about $10^8$--$10^9$ K, which sets the energetic scale for thermal fluctuations of state of Fermi liquid from the ground state. The nuclear energy contributions are described using the same parametrization Sk$\chi$450 for the bulk, plain surface and curvature terms. We find that the introduction of the curvature correction changes the ground state in a relevant way. This may be understood as a consequence of the corresponding change in size of the nucleus, which significantly modifies the phase transition densities. Using the calculated structural parameters from liquid drop model, we explore the physical consequences of the expected Cooper pairing of protons in lasagna phase. In this case, we find a crossover between the discreet layered and the three-dimensional anisotropic regimes of superconductivity. Additionally, we study the magnetic stress in lasagna accounting for a rotational lag between superfluid neutrons and the crystal lattice, which is believed to develop naturally in pulsars and magnetars. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the inner crust of neutron stars.</description>
