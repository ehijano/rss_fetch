      <title>Elasto-Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry, preserve the crystal translation invariance, and have a spin density with $d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc. momentum dependencies which do not contribute to the magnetization. When an $s$-wave spin-density contribution cannot be excluded by symmetry a small magnetization and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) emerge. However, for so-called "pure" altermagnets, where the $s$-wave component is symmetry forbidden even in the presence of SOC, both the zero-field magnetization and the AHE vanish. We show that altermagnets generally exhibit a non-zero elasto-Hall-conductivity, by which application of strain leads to a non-zero AHE. For pure altermagnets it is the only contribution to the AHE. This elasto-Hall-conductivity is caused by strain coupling to the Berry curvature quadrupole that characterizes altermagnets and allows for the determination of the altermagnetic order using transport measurements that are linear in the electrical field. We further show that the emergence of a non-zero magnetization in the presence of strain arises from a different response function: piezomagnetism. While this magnetization gives rise to an additional contribution to the elasto-Hall conductivity, the corresponding Berry curvature is qualitatively different from the distorted Berry curvature quadrupole originating from the altermagnetic order parameter. This insight also helps to disentangle AHE and weak ferromagnetism for systems with symmetry-allowed $s$-wave contribution. Quantitatively, the elasto-Hall conductivity is particularly pronounced for systems with a Dirac spectrum in the altermagnetic state. The same mechanism gives rise to anomalous elasto-thermal Hall, Nernst, and Ettinghausen effects.</description>

      <title>Multi-Output Convolutional Neural Network for Improved Parameter Extraction in Time-Resolved Electrostatic Force Microscopy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved scanning probe microscopy methods, like time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM), enable imaging of dynamic processes ranging from ion motion in batteries to electronic dynamics in microstructured thin film semiconductors for solar cells. Reconstructing the underlying physical dynamics from these techniques can be challenging due to the interplay of cantilever physics with the actual transient kinetics of interest in the resulting signal. Previously, quantitative trEFM used empirical calibration of the cantilever or feed-forward neural networks trained on simulated data to extract the physical dynamics of interest. Both these approaches are limited by interpreting the underlying signal as a single exponential function, which serves as an approximation but does not adequately reflect many realistic systems. Here, we present a multi-branched, multi-output convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses the trEFM signal in addition to the physical cantilever parameters as input. The trained CNN accurately extracts parameters describing both single-exponential and bi-exponential underlying functions, and more accurately reconstructs real experimental data in the presence of noise. This work demonstrates an application of physics-informed machine learning to complex signal processing tasks, enabling more efficient and accurate analysis of trEFM.</description>

      <title>Universal machine learning interatomic potentials poised to supplant DFT in modeling general defects in metals and random alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, combined with the generation of extensive density functional theory (DFT) datasets, have enabled the development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). These models offer broad applicability across the periodic table, achieving first-principles accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional DFT calculations. In this study, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art pretrained uMLIPs can effectively replace DFT for accurately modeling complex defects in a wide range of metals and alloys. Our investigation spans diverse scenarios, including grain boundaries and general defects in pure metals, defects in high-entropy alloys, hydrogen-alloy interactions, and solute-defect interactions. Remarkably, the latest EquiformerV2 models achieve DFT-level accuracy on comprehensive defect datasets, with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 5 meV/atom for energies and 100 meV/{\AA} for forces, outperforming specialized machine learning potentials such as moment tensor potential and atomic cluster expansion. We also present a systematic analysis of accuracy versus computational cost and explore uncertainty quantification for uMLIPs. A detailed case study of tungsten (W) demonstrates that data on pure W alone is insufficient for modeling complex defects in uMLIPs, underscoring the critical importance of advanced machine learning architectures and diverse datasets, which include over 100 million structures spanning all elements. These findings establish uMLIPs as a robust alternative to DFT and a transformative tool for accelerating the discovery and design of high-performance materials.</description>

      <title>SymmCD: Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating novel crystalline materials has potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.</description>

      <title>Energy &amp; Force Regression on DFT Trajectories is Not Enough for Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal Machine Learning Interactomic Potentials (MLIPs) enable accelerated simulations for materials discovery. However, current research efforts fail to impactfully utilize MLIPs due to: 1. Overreliance on Density Functional Theory (DFT) for MLIP training data creation; 2. MLIPs' inability to reliably and accurately perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for diverse materials; 3. Limited understanding of MLIPs' underlying capabilities. To address these shortcomings, we aargue that MLIP research efforts should prioritize: 1. Employing more accurate simulation methods for large-scale MLIP training data creation (e.g. Coupled Cluster Theory) that cover a wide range of materials design spaces; 2. Creating MLIP metrology tools that leverage large-scale benchmarking, visualization, and interpretability analyses to provide a deeper understanding of MLIPs' inner workings; 3. Developing computationally efficient MLIPs to execute MD simulations that accurately model a broad set of materials properties. Together, these interdisciplinary research directions can help further the real-world application of MLIPs to accurately model complex materials at device scale.</description>

      <title>Microstructure-Aware Bayesian Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel microstructure-sensitive Bayesian optimization (BO) framework designed to enhance the efficiency of materials discovery by explicitly incorporating microstructural information. Traditional materials design approaches often focus exclusively on direct chemistry-process-property relationships, overlooking the critical role of microstructures. To address this limitation, our framework integrates microstructural descriptors as latent variables, enabling the construction of a comprehensive process-structure-property mapping that improves both predictive accuracy and optimization outcomes. By employing the active subspace method for dimensionality reduction, we identify the most influential microstructural features, thereby reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy in the design process. This approach also enhances the probabilistic modeling capabilities of Gaussian processes, accelerating convergence to optimal material configurations with fewer iterations and experimental observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through synthetic and real-world case studies, including the design of Mg$_2$Sn$_x$Si$_{1-x}$ thermoelectric materials for energy conversion. Our results underscore the critical role of microstructures in linking processing conditions to material properties, highlighting the potential of a microstructure-aware design paradigm to revolutionize materials discovery. Furthermore, this work suggests that since incorporating microstructure awareness improves the efficiency of Bayesian materials discovery, microstructure characterization stages should be integral to automated -- and eventually autonomous -- platforms for materials development.</description>

      <title>Stacking effects on magnetic, vibrational, and optical properties of CrSBr bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The van der Waals layered semiconductor CrSBr, which exhibits A-type antiferromagnetism and a relatively high N\'{e}el temperature, has been successfully exfoliated into atomically thin sheets. In this study, we investigate the structural, lattice dynamical, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of four distinct stacking structures of CrSBr bilayers using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings show that though the most energetically favorable bilayer structure retains the stacking pattern of the bulk counterpart, three other high-symmetry stacking structures can be achieved by sliding one of the layers along three distinct directions, with energy costs comparable to that observed in MoS$_2$ bilayer. All these four bilayers exhibit semiconductor behavior with A-type antiferromagnetic ordering, similar to the bulk material, and demonstrate closely aligned N\'{e}el temperatures. Moreover, these bilayers exhibit relatively low lattice thermal conductivities, pronounced anisotropy, and a strong dependence on stacking patterns. This behavior is attributed to significant phonon-phonon scattering arising from avoided crossings between acoustic and optical phonons, as well as the presence of flat optical phonon bands in the low-frequency region. While the electronic structures and optical properties of these bilayers show weak dependence on the stacking pattern for antiferromagnetic ordering, they undergo significant changes for ferromagnetic ordering, influencing the band gap, valence and conduction band splitting, and effective mass. Furthermore, we found that antiferromagnetic ordering can transition to ferromagnetic under intense visible light illumination. Thus, the integration of layer stacking and visible light illumination offers an effective means to control the heat transfer, magnetic, and optical properties of CrSBr bilayers.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking induced surface magnetization in non-magnetic RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly identified phase of magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been considered a prototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room temperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of RuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru sublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite significant (approximately 1 $\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic order. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru in RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely non-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the 4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In this work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface exhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of local symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment enhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting spectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states, spin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent transport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface magnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Approach to Structural Relaxation and Diffusion in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are promising materials with unique mechanical and thermal properties, but their atomic-scale dynamics remain challenging to understand. In this work, we develop a unified approach to investigate the glass transition and structural relaxation in CoCrNi, Zr46Cu46Al8, Zr50Cu40Al10, and Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 metallic glasses. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is employed to analyze the radial distribution function at different temperatures and accurately determine the glass transition temperature. We then combine this temperature with the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time, tau_alpha(T). By connecting $\tau_\alpha(T)$ to the diffusion constant, the ECNLE predictions of tau_alpha(T) can be compared with those calculated from MD simulations or estimated based on the diffusion constant. By combining atomistic simulation with force-level statistical mechanics, our multiscale approach offers deeper insights into relaxation dynamics and diffusion across various timescales. The relationship between the glass transition and the liquidus temperature is elucidated. This study enhances understanding of the glassy dynamics and properties in complex amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Heteroepitaxial growth of highly anisotropic $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ films on GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epitaxial integration of anisotropic materials with mainstream cubic semiconductors opens new routes to advanced electronic and photonic devices with directional properties. In this work, we synthesize heteroepitaxial thin films of orthorhombic "quasi-1D" $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ on cubic GaAs(001) using molecular beam epitaxy. Traditionally, the synthesis of anisotropic films with low symmetry materials is challenging due to multiple grain orientations that form. On a macroscopic scale, such a film tends towards isotropic properties, even if individual grains possess anisotropic responses. We achieve epitaxial $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ grains on pristine homoepitaxial GaAs templates at low temperatures of 180-200 {\deg}C. With the $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ 1D axis aligned in-plane to GaAs [110] and the primary van der Waals direction lying out-of-plane, we find a birefringence of 0.2 between in-plane orthogonal directions and a giant out-of-plane birefringence greater than 1 at telecom wavelengths. Growth at higher temperatures up to 265 {\deg}C yields $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ of an unusual in-plane rotated texture that further enhances the in-plane optical index anisotropy to 0.3.</description>

      <title>Pisarenko's Formula for the Thermopower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermopower $\alpha$ (also known as the Seebeck coefficient) is one of the most fundamental material characteristics for understanding charge carrier transport in thermoelectric materials. Here, we revisit the Pisarenko formula for the thermopower, which was traditionally considered valid only for non-degenerate semiconductors. We demonstrate that regardless of the dominating scattering mechanism, the Pisarenko formula describes accurately enough the relationship between thermopower $\alpha$ and charge carrier concentration $n$ beyond the non-degenerate limit. Moreover, the Pisarenko formula provides a simple thermopower-conductivity relation, $\alpha = \pm \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}}{e} (b - \ln \sigma)$, valid for materials with $\alpha &gt; 90$ $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ when acoustic phonon scattering is predominant. This offers an alternative way to analyze electron transport when Hall measurements are difficult or inaccessible. Additionally, we show how the Pisarenko formula can be used to estimate the maximum power factor of a thermoelectric material from the weighted mobility of a single, not necessarily optimized, sample at any given temperature.</description>

      <title>Dendrite Suppression in Zn Batteries Through Hetero-Epitaxial Residual Stresses Shield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dendrite formation is a long-standing problem for the commercial application of aqueous zinc (Zn)-ion batteries (AZIB). Here, we investigate the effect of hetero-epitaxial residual stresses due to layered coatings on dendrite suppression. We found that atomic and molecular layered coatings can substantially reduce dendritic growth in AZIB by providing shielding due to residual stresses, even at single and a few layers of coatings. Through a combined experimental and numerical approach, we demonstrate that the residual stresses developed due to the coating of the Zn anodes significantly reduced the chemical potential polarization around dendrite embryos, forcing the deposition of zinc in the regions adjacent to the protuberances. This, in turn, results in a slower rate of dendritic growth, and eventually, dendrite suppression. The fundamental understanding of the effect of residual stresses due to coatings demonstrated herein can be extended to various metal anode batteries such as Li or Na.</description>

      <title>The Role of Tunneling Oxide in the Low Frequency Noise of Multi-level Silicon Nitride ReRAMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the characteristics of two CMOS-compatible RRAM cells utilizing silicon nitride as the switching material. By employing SET/RESET pulse sequences, the study successfully attains four distinct and stable resistance states. To gain deeper insights, a Low-Frequency Noise (LFN) statistical analysis is conducted to investigate the role of a tunneling oxide between the bottom electrode and SiNx at various resistance levels. The findings from the LFN measurements strongly suggest that the multilevel high resistance switching primarily arises from variations in the number of nitrogen vacancies, which in turn modulate the conductivity of conductive filaments (CF). Notably, this modulation does not compromise the quality of the filament's surrounding interface. This research sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of RRAM cells and their potential for advanced memory applications.</description>

Abstract: Spin space groups, formed by operations where the rotation of the spins is independent of the accompanying operation acting on the crystal structure, are appropriate groups to describe the symmetry of magnetic structures with null spin-orbit coupling. Their corresponding spin point groups are the symmetry groups to be considered for deriving the symmetry constraints on the form of the crystal tensor properties of such idealized structures. These groups can also be taken as approximate symmetries (with some restrictions) of real magnetic structures, where spin-orbit and magnetic anisotropy are however present. Here we formalize the invariance transformation properties that must satisfy the most important crystal tensors under a spin point group. This is done using modified Jahn symbols, which generalize those applicable to ordinary magnetic point groups [Gallego et al., Acta Cryst. (2019) A{\bf 75}, 438-447]. The analysis includes not only equilibrium tensors, but also transport, optical and non-linear optical susceptibility tensors. The constraints imposed by spin collinearity and coplanarity within the spin group formalism on a series of representative tensors are discussed and compiled. As illustrative examples, the defined tensor invariance equations have been applied to some known magnetic structures, showing the differences of the symmetry-adapted form of some relevant tensors, when considered under the constraints of its spin point group or its magnetic point group. This comparison, with the spin point group implying additional constraints in the tensor form, may allow to distinguish those magnetic-related properties that can be solely attributed to spin-orbit coupling from those that are expected to be present even under negligible spin-orbit effects.</description>

      <title>Triple-Q state in magnetic breathing kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic frustration in two-dimensional spin lattices with triangular motifs underpins a series of exotic states, ranging from multi-Q configurations to disordered spin-glasses. The antiferromagnetic kagome lattice, characterized by its network of corner-sharing triangles, represents a paradigmatic frustrated system exhibiting macroscopic degeneracy. Expanding upon the kagomerization mechanism, we focus on the magnetic breathing kagome lattice formed by a Mn monolayer deposited on a heavy metal substrate and capped with h-BN. The Mn kagome arrangement induces pronounced magnetic frustration, as evidenced by the nearly flat bands derived from spin spiral energy calculations. Including further-neighbor interactions reveals a spin spiral energy minimum along the $\Gamma$-K line and an intriguing triple-Q state with nonzero topological charge, potentially leading to highly nonlinear Hall effects. Furthermore, the flat band properties can further give rise to an even more complex spin configuration, marked by several Q-pockets in the spin structure factor. These results present a fertile ground for advancing the study of multi-Q states and exploring emergent topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence Features of Few-Layer Hexagonal $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium (III) selenide is currently one of the most actively studied materials in the two-dimensional family due to its remarkable ferroelectric and optical properties. This study focuses on the luminescent properties of few-layer In$_2$Se$_3$ flakes with thicknesses ranging from 7 to 100 monolayers. To explore the photoluminescence features and correlate them with changes in crystal symmetry and surface potential, we employed a combination of techniques, including temperature-dependent micro-photoluminescence, time-resolved photoluminescence, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the samples studied possess the $\alpha$-polytype structure. The micro-photoluminescence spectrum consists of two bands, A and B, with band B almost completely disappearing at room temperature. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence and time-resolved measurements helped us to elucidate the nature of the observed bands. We find that peak A is associated with emission from interband transitions in In$_2$Se$_3$, while peak B is attributed to defect-related emission. Additionally, the photoluminescence decay times of In$_2$Se$_3$ flakes with varying thicknesses were determined. No significant changes were observed in the decay components as the thickness increased from 7 to 100 monolayers, suggesting that there are no qualitative changes in the band structure.</description>

      <title>Atomically Thin Metallenes at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes are a new family of materials representing the ultimate limit of a thin free-electron gas for novel applications. Although metallene research has gained traction, limited attention has been paid to the properties of their ubiquitous edges. Here, we use density-functional theory simulations to investigate various edges of Mg, Cu, Y, Au, and Pb metallenes with hexagonal and buckled honeycomb lattices. Investigating relaxations, energies, stresses, and electronic structures at the edge, we find that some properties have clear trends while others are sensitive to both element and lattice type. Given that edge properties are fundamental to metallene stability and interactions in lateral heterostructures, their detailed understanding will help guide the development of metallene synthesis and applications.</description>

      <title>Search for stable and low-energy Ce-Co-Cu ternary compounds using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerium-based intermetallics have garnered significant research attention as potential new permanent magnets. In this study, we explore the compositional and structural landscape of Ce-Co-Cu ternary compounds using a machine learning (ML)-guided framework integrated with first-principles calculations. We employ a crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN), which enables efficient screening for promising candidates, significantly accelerating the materials discovery process. With this approach, we predict five stable compounds, Ce3Co3Cu, CeCoCu2, Ce12Co7Cu, Ce11Co9Cu and Ce10Co11Cu4, with formation energies below the convex hull, along with hundreds of low-energy (possibly metastable) Ce-Co-Cu ternary compounds. First-principles calculations reveal that several structures are both energetically and dynamically stable. Notably, two Co-rich low-energy compounds, Ce4Co33Cu and Ce4Co31Cu3, are predicted to have high magnetizations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling three types of fermions in a nodal ring topological semimetal through magneto-optical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasiparticles of a single nodal ring semimetal SrAs$_3$ through axis-resolved magneto-optical measurements. We observe three types of Landau levels scaling as $\varepsilon \sim \sqrt{B}$, $\varepsilon \sim B^{2/3}$, and $\varepsilon \sim B$ that correspond to Dirac, semi-Dirac, and classical fermions, respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we identify the distinct origins of these three types of fermions present within the nodal ring. In particular, semi-Dirac fermions--a novel type of fermion that can give rise to a range of unique quantum phenomena--emerge from the endpoints of the nodal ring where the energy band disperses linearly along one direction and quadratically along the perpendicular direction, a feature not achievable in nodal point or line structures. The capacity of the nodal ring to simultaneously host multiple fermion types, including semi-Dirac fermions, establishes it as a valuable platform to expand the understanding of topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Large Negative Magnetoresistance in off-Stochiometric Topological Material PrSbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials LnSbTe (Ln = lanthanide) have attracted intensive attention because of the presence of interplay between magnetism, topological, and electron correlations depending on the choices of magnetic Ln elements. Varying Sb and Te composition is an efficient approach to control structural, magnetic, and electronic properties. Here we report the composition-dependent properties in PrSbxTe2-x. We identified the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structure transitions in this material system, and very large negative magnetoresistance in the x = 0.3 composition, which might be ascribed to the coupling between magnetism and transport. Such unusual magnetotransport enables PrSbxTe2-x topological materials as a promising platform for device applications.</description>

      <title>Site-engineered ferromagnetism in Ca and Cr co-substituted Bismuth Ferrite Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic perovskites that exhibit room temperature magnetization and polarization have immense potential in the next generation of magneto-electric and spintronic memory devices. In this work, the magnetic and ferroelectric properties of Bismuth Ferrite, BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles (NPs) were enhanced through simultaneous A and B site Ca and Cr co-substitution. Novel compositions of Bi0.97Ca0.03CrxFe1-xO3 (x=0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) were synthesized using the sol-gel route and annealed at 550 degrees Celcius. Rietveld Refinement of XRD patterns confirmed high phase purity, while SEM analysis revealed a decreasing trend in average particle size with increasing dopant concentration. Hysteresis loops showed enhanced magnetic properties as particle size approached the spin cycloid wavelength (around 62 nm), disrupting the intrinsic antiferromagnetic ordering of BFO. Moreover, the presence of exchange bias in the NPs was linked to the formation of core-shell structure. Temperature dependent magnetization studies showed an increase in N\'eel temperature upon Ca substitution. XPS analysis confirmed that Bi0.97Ca0.03FeO3 samples exhibited the highest oxygen vacancy concentration, while Fe3+ remained the dominant oxidation state across all compositions. Ferroelectric polarization loop measurements showed enhanced remanent polarization in doped samples, with leakage linked to oxygen vacancies and extrinsic microstructural effects.</description>

      <title>Realizing Quantitative Quasiparticle Modeling of Skyrmion Dynamics in Arbitrary Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate fully quantitative Thiele model simulations of magnetic skyrmion dynamics on previously unattainable experimentally relevant large length and time scales by ascertaining the key missing parameters needed to calibrate the experimental and simulation time scales and current-induced forces. Our work allows us to determine complete spatial pinning energy landscapes that enable quantification of experimental studies of diffusion in arbitrary potentials within the Lifson-Jackson framework. Our method enables us to ascertain the time scales, and by isolating the effect of ultra-low current density (order $10^6 A/m^2$) generated torques we directly infer the total force acting on the skyrmion for a quantitative modelling.</description>

      <title>Polarons and Exciton-Polarons in Two-Dimensional Polar Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a macroscopic theory of optical phonons, Fr{\"oh}lich polarons, and exciton-polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar crystalline monolayers. Our theory extends the classical macroscopic formulation of the electron-phonon problem in three-dimensional (3D) polar crystals to the new generation of 2D materials. Similarly to the 3D case, in our approach, the effective electron-phonon Hamiltonian is parametrized solely in terms of macroscopic experimentally accessible quantities -- 2D polarizabilities of the monolayer at low and high frequencies. We derive the dispersion of long wave length longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, which can be viewed as a 2D form of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, and study the formation of 2D Fr{\"oh}lich polarons by adopting the intermediate coupling approximation. Finally, we apply this approach to excitons in polar 2D crystals and derive an effective potential of the electron-hole interaction dressed by LO phonons. Due to the specific dispersion of LO phonons, the polarons and exciton-polarons in 2D materials exhibit unique features not found in their 3D counterparts. As an illustration, the polaron and exciton-polaron binding energies are computed for a representative set of 2D polar crystals, demonstrating the interplay between dimensionality, polarizability of materials, and electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Twist, splay, and uniform domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently-discovered ferroelectric nematic ($\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$) liquid crystal presents a host of defect phenomena due to its unique polar nature and long-ranged electrostatic interactions. Like the solid state ferroelectrics, the depolarization field in the material favors a spontaneous spatial variation of the polarization $\mathbf{P}$, manifesting in myriad ways including a twist in the bulk and different arrangements of alternating polarization domains. Unlike the solid-state ferroelectrics with a bulk crystalline structure, the configuration of the $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$ fluids is determined not only by the reduction of depolarization fields but also by the alignment of molecules at interfaces. In this work, we consider an $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$ confined to a thin cell, pre-patterned with various types of apolar surface anchoring produced by photoalignment. For uniform planar alignment, we find that the sample forms a series of striped domains. For a cell pre-patterned with a radial +1 defect pattern, the $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{F}$ breaks up into "pie-slice" polarization domains. We calculate the elastic and electrostatic energy balance which determines the observed configurations and demonstrate that the electrostatic interactions tend to decrease the characteristic domain size $\lambda$ while the elastic and surface anchoring interactions facilitate a larger $\lambda$. We also demonstrate that ionic screening mitigates electrostatic interactions, increasing $\lambda$ and, above some critical concentration, eliminating the domains altogether.</description>

      <title>Oxygen sublattice disorder and valence state modulation in infinite-layer nickelate superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of infinite-layer nickelates promises important insights into the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. Since superconductivity has so far only been observed in epitaxial thin films, heteroepitaxy with the substrate or a capping layer possibly plays an important role. Here, we use soft x-ray spectroscopy to investigate superlattices as a potential approach for a targeted material design of high-temperature superconductors. We observe modulations in valence state and oxygen coordination in topotactically reduced artificial superlattices with repeating interfaces between nickelate layers and layers of materials commonly used as substrates and capping layers. Our results show that depending on the interlayer material metallic conductivity akin to the parent infinite-layer compounds is achieved. Depth-resolved electronic structure measured by resonant x-ray reflectivity reveals a reconstructed ligand field and valence state at the interface, which is confined to one or two unit cells. The central layers show characteristics of monovalent nickel, but linear dichroism analysis reveals considerable disorder in the oxygen removal sites. We observe a quantitative correlation of this disorder with the interlayer material that is important for future modeling and design strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review brings together a body of experimental, theoretical, and simulation work addressing the behaviour of high-field devices and the fundamental process of vacuum arcing, also referred to as vacuum breakdown. Detailed experimental observations and results relating to a wide range of aspects of high-field devices including conditioning, field and temperature dependence of breakdown rate, and the field-holding capability as a function of device geometry and of different materials are presented. The different observations are then addressed theoretically, and with simulation, capturing the sequence of processes that lead to vacuum breakdown and explaining the major observed experimental dependencies. The core of the work described in this review was carried out by a broad multi-disciplinary collaboration in an over a decade-long program to develop high-gradient, 100 MV/m-range, accelerating structures for the CLIC project, a possible future linear-collider high-energy physics facility. Connections are made to the broader linear collider, high-field, and breakdown communities.</description>

      <title>An inelastic neutron scattering study of the magnetic field dependence of the quantum dipolar garnet: Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The garnet compound Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ is a fascinating material that is considered highly suitable for low-temperature refrigeration, via the magnetocaloric effect, in addition to enabling the exploration of quantum states with long-range dipolar interactions. It has previously been theorized that the magnetocaloric effect can be enhanced, in Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ , via magnetic soft mode excitations which in the hyperkagome structure would be derived from an emergent magnetic structure formed from nanosized 10-spin loops. We study the magnetic field dependence of bands of magnetic soft mode excitations in the effective spin $S = 1/2$ hyperkagome compound Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ using single crystal inelastic neutron scattering. We probe the magnetically short ranged ordered state, in which we determine magnetic nanoscale structures coexisting with a fluctuating state, and the magnetically saturated state. We determine that Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ can be described as a quantum dipolar magnet with perturbative weak near-neighbor and inter-hyperkagome exchange interaction. The magnetic excitations, under the application of a magnetic field, reveal highly robust soft modes with distinctive signatures of the quantum nature of the Yb3+ spins.

      <title>Terahertz Defect Detection in Multi-Layer Materials Using Echo Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-destructive testing is an important technique for detecting defects in multi-layer materials, enabling the evaluation of structural integrity without causing damage on test materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers unique capabilities for this purpose due to its sensitivity and resolution. Inspired by room geometry estimation methods in acoustic signal processing, this work proposes a novel approach for defect detection in multi-layer composite materials using THz-TDS, enhanced by high-power sources. The proposed method utilizes Euclidean distance matrices to reduce problem complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and effectively distinguishes and maps higher-order reflections from sublayers, enabling precise defect localization in composite materials without artifacts.</description>

      <title>Phonon spectra, quantum geometry, and the Goldstone theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonons are essential (quasi)particles of all crystals and play a key role in fundamental properties such as thermal transport and superconductivity. In particular, acoustic phonons can be viewed as the Goldstone modes arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. In this article, we present a comprehensive - in the absence of Holstein phonons - theory of the quantum geometric contributions to the phonon spectra of crystals. Using graphene as a case study, we separate the dynamical matrix into several terms that depend differently on the electron energy and wavefunction, and demonstrate that the quantum geometric effects are crucial in shaping the phonon spectra of the material. Neglecting them leads to a gap in the acoustic phonon branches, which clearly violates the Goldstone theorem.</description>

      <title>Landau Theory of Barocaloric Plastic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a minimal Landau theory of plastic-to-crystal phase transitions in which the key components are a multipole-moment order parameter that describes the orientational ordering of the constituent molecules, coupling between such order parameter and elastic strains, and thermal expansion. We illustrate the theory with the simplest non-trivial model in which the orientational ordering is described by a quadrupole moment, and use such model to calculate barocaloric effects in plastic crystals that are driven by hydrostatic pressure. The model captures characteristic features of plastic-to-crystal phase transitions, namely, large changes in volume and entropy at the transition, as well as the linear dependence of the transition temperature with pressure. We identify temperature regions in the barocaloric response associated with the individual plastic and crystal phases, and those involving the phase transition. Our model is in overall agreement with previous experiments in powdered samples of fullerite C$_{60}$, and predicts peak isothermal entropy changes of $\sim90 \,{\rm J K^{-1} kg^{-1}}$ and peak adiabatic temperature changes of $\sim35 \,{\rm K}$ under $0.60\,$GPa at $265\,$K in fullerite single crystals.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional mapping of the altermagnetic spin splitting in CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a kind of collinear magnetism that is characterized by a momentum-dependent band and spin splitting without net magnetization, has recently attracted considerable interest. Finding altermagnetic materials with large splitting near the Fermi level necessarily requires three-dimensional k-space mapping. While this is crucial for spintronic applications and emergent phenomena, it remains challenging. Here, using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and model calculations, we uncover a large altermagnetic splitting, up to ~1.0 eV, near the Fermi level in CrSb. We verify its bulk-type g-wave altermagnetism through systematic three-dimensional k-space mapping, which unambiguously reveals the altermagnetic symmetry and associated nodal planes. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements further verify the spin polarizations of the split bands near Fermi level. Tight-binding model analysis indicates that the large altermagnetic splitting arises from strong third-nearest-neighbor hopping mediated by Sb ions. The large band/spin splitting near Fermi level in metallic CrSb, together with its high TN (up to 705 K) and simple spin configuration, paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena and spintronic applications based on altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Electrically activated W-doped VO2 films for reliable, large-area, broadband THz waves modulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: THz amplitude modulators and switches are considered to be the main building blocks of future THz communication systems. Despite rapid progress, modulation and switching devices in this electromagnetic spectrum lag far behind other frequency ranges. Currently, THz modu-lators face major challenges in consistently producing high modulations depths over large frequency bands. Moreover, a convenient integration for practical applications requires that the modulation/switching properties can be electrically controlled. Devices fulfilling all these con-ditions remain to be demonstrated. In this work we show that W-doped VO2 films grown by direct-current magnetron sputtering can be efficiently used for the development reliable, large-area, broadband THz waves modulators. We demonstrate that W doping not only permits to tune the insulator to metal transition (IMT) temperature of VO2, but also, most importantly, to control the topology of the electrically activated transition. In situ / operando X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy characterizations of the devices, coupled with standard resistivi-ty measurements and time-domain THz spectroscopy, unambiguously demonstrate that the changes in the spatial distribution of the IMT is due to structural distortions induced by W doping.</description>

      <title>A phenomenological magnetomechanical model for hysteresis loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose a simple phenomenological model for magnetization curves of stressed samples. The effect of stress is introduced by scaling the arctangent function argument (magnetic field) proportionally to stress. The magnetization curve is modelled by one or two arctangent functions. Despite of its simplicity, the model gives a very good agreement with experimental curves, reproducing all stress-induced features usually observed on the magnetization curves including the common crossover point and constricted hysteresis loops. The popular effective field concept in this model is just a consequence of a simple scaling of the magnetic field. We show that the differential susceptibility is inversely proportional to the applied stress for all magnetization values. We propose to analyze the field and differential susceptibility as a function of magnetization in contrast to convenient M(H) loops.</description>

      <title>Reactive Fluid Ferroelectrics: A Gateway to the Next Generation of Ferroelectric Liquid Crystalline Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein we report the first examples of reactive mesogenic materials (RMs) which exhibit fluid ferroelectric order based on the recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase. We term these materials NF RMs and they provide the first steps towards the next generation of ferroelectric liquid crystalline polymer networks. We report the chemical synthesis and characterisation of the liquid crystalline properties of these materials, demonstrating that they have the lowest longitudinal molecular dipole moments of any reported NF material of 7.39 D. We go on to demonstrate a potential use case of this new class of reactive material through the polymer stabilisation of a matrix which exhibits the NF phase, increasing the phase range of the ferroelectric phase from 75 {\deg}C to 120 {\deg}C. The NF RMs reported herein are an exciting step forward in ferroelectric liquid crystal research, demonstrating that reactive NF materials are achievable, allowing for the future development of liquid crystalline ferroelectric networks, elastomers and polymers.</description>

      <title>Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced instability of a Weyl nodal loop semimetal towards a diffusive topological metal with protected multifractal surface states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl nodal loop semimetals are gapless topological phases that, unlike their insulator counterparts, may be unstable to small perturbations that respect their topology-protecting symmetries. Here, we analyze a clean system perturbed by chiral off-diagonal disorder using numerically exact methods. We establish that the ballistic semimetallic phase is unstable towards the formation of an unconventional topological diffusive metal hosting topological multifractal surface states. Although, as in the clean case, surface states are exponentially localized along the direction perpendicular to the nodal loop, disorder induces a multifractal structure in the remaining directions. Surprisingly, the number of these states also increases with a small amount of disorder. Eventually, as disorder is further increased, the number of surface states starts decreasing.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and magnetic ordering in chalcogen-intercalated graphene bilayers with charge compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</description>
