      <title>InstructBioMol: Advancing Biomolecule Understanding and Design Following Human Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and designing biomolecules, such as proteins and small molecules, is central to advancing drug discovery, synthetic biology, and enzyme engineering. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have revolutionized biomolecular research, achieving remarkable accuracy in biomolecular prediction and design. However, a critical gap remains between AI's computational power and researchers' intuition, using natural language to align molecular complexity with human intentions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential to interpret human intentions, yet their application to biomolecular research remains nascent due to challenges including specialized knowledge requirements, multimodal data integration, and semantic alignment between natural language and biomolecules. To address these limitations, we present InstructBioMol, a novel LLM designed to bridge natural language and biomolecules through a comprehensive any-to-any alignment of natural language, molecules, and proteins. This model can integrate multimodal biomolecules as input, and enable researchers to articulate design goals in natural language, providing biomolecular outputs that meet precise biological needs. Experimental results demonstrate InstructBioMol can understand and design biomolecules following human instructions. Notably, it can generate drug molecules with a 10% improvement in binding affinity and design enzymes that achieve an ESP Score of 70.4, making it the only method to surpass the enzyme-substrate interaction threshold of 60.0 recommended by the ESP developer. This highlights its potential to transform real-world biomolecular research.</description>

      <title>Contrastive learning of T cell receptor representations</title>

Abstract: Computational prediction of the interaction of T cell receptors (TCRs) and their ligands is a grand challenge in immunology. Despite advances in high-throughput assays, specificity-labelled TCR data remains sparse. In other domains, the pre-training of language models on unlabelled data has been successfully used to address data bottlenecks. However, it is unclear how to best pre-train protein language models for TCR specificity prediction. Here we introduce a TCR language model called SCEPTR (Simple Contrastive Embedding of the Primary sequence of T cell Receptors), capable of data-efficient transfer learning. Through our model, we introduce a novel pre-training strategy combining autocontrastive learning and masked-language modelling, which enables SCEPTR to achieve its state-of-the-art performance. In contrast, existing protein language models and a variant of SCEPTR pre-trained without autocontrastive learning are outperformed by sequence alignment-based methods. We anticipate that contrastive learning will be a useful paradigm to decode the rules of TCR specificity.</description>

      <title>CBGBench: Fill in the Blank of Protein-Molecule Complex Binding Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate potential drugs that can bind to a target protein and is greatly expedited by the aid of AI techniques in generative models. However, a lack of systematic understanding persists due to the diverse settings, complex implementation, difficult reproducibility, and task singularity. Firstly, the absence of standardization can lead to unfair comparisons and inconclusive insights. To address this dilemma, we propose CBGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for SBDD, that unifies the task as a generative heterogeneous graph completion, analogous to fill-in-the-blank of the 3D complex binding graph. By categorizing existing methods based on their attributes, CBGBench facilitates a modular and extensible framework that implements various cutting-edge methods. Secondly, a single task on \textit{de novo} molecule generation can hardly reflect their capabilities. To broaden the scope, we have adapted these models to a range of tasks essential in drug design, which are considered sub-tasks within the graph fill-in-the-blank tasks. These tasks include the generative designation of \textit{de novo} molecules, linkers, fragments, scaffolds, and sidechains, all conditioned on the structures of protein pockets. Our evaluations are conducted with fairness, encompassing comprehensive perspectives on interaction, chemical properties, geometry authenticity, and substructure validity. We further provide the pre-trained versions of the state-of-the-art models and deep insights with analysis from empirical studies. The codebase for CBGBench is publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/Edapinenut/CBGBench}.</description>
