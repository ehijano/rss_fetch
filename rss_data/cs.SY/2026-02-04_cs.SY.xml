      <title>Estimation of Cell-to-Cell Variation and State of Health for Battery Modules with Parallel-Connected Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating cell-to-cell variation (CtCV) and state of health (SoH) for battery modules with parallel-connected cells is challenging when only module-level signals are measurable and individual cell behaviors remain unobserved. Although progress has been made in SoH estimation, CtCV estimation remains unresolved in the literature. This paper proposes a unified framework that accurately estimates both CtCV and SoH for modules using only module-level information extracted from incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA). With the proposed framework, CtCV and SoH estimations can be decoupled into two separate tasks, allowing each to be solved with dedicated algorithms without mutual interference and providing greater design flexibility. The framework also exhibits strong versatility in accommodating different CtCV metrics, highlighting its general-purpose nature. Experimental validation on modules with three parallel-connected cells demonstrates that the proposed framework can systematically select optimal module-level features for CtCV and SoH estimations, deliver accurate CtCV and SoH estimates with high confidence and low computational complexity, remain effective across different C-rates, and be suitable for onboard implementation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems: Dictionary-based Sparse Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems are a key technology for future wireless networks, but the large array aperture naturally creates a hybrid-field (HF) propagation regime in which far-field (FF) planar-wave and near-field (NF) spherical-wave components coexist. This work considers the problem of HF channel estimation (CE) and introduces a unified model that superimposes FF and NF contributions according to the Rayleigh distance boundary. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of the channel in the angular and polar domains, we formulate the estimation task as a sparse recovery problem. Unlike conventional approaches that require prior knowledge of the channel sparsity level, the proposed method operates without requiring knowledge of the sparsity level L and the NF/FF ratio {\gamma}, which are used only for synthetic channel generation in simulations. The channel estimator determines the number of paths adaptively through a residual-based stopping rule. A combined FF/NF dictionary is employed to initialize the support, and each selected atom undergoes continuous parameter refinement to mitigate grid mismatch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves accurate HF channel reconstruction under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, offering a practical and computationally efficient solution for XL-MIMO systems.

      <title>Fast Diffusion with Physics-Correction for ACOPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating large-scale, physically consistent AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) datasets is essential for modern data-driven power system applications. The central challenge lies in balancing solution accuracy with computational efficiency. Recent diffusion-based generative models produce high-quality samples; however, their slow sampling procedures limit practical scalability. In this work, we argue that exact physical feasibility is ultimately enforced by power flow solvers or projection steps, and therefore the generative model only needs to produce good initializations rather than perfectly feasible solutions. Based on this insight, we propose a fast diffusion framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) combined with physics-guided corrections during sampling. The proposed method replaces slow stochastic refinement with a small number of deterministic steps and explicit constraint guidance. Experiments on IEEE 6-, 24-, and 118-bus systems show that our approach achieves up to 20 times faster sampling than standard diffusion models while maintaining comparable statistical accuracy and physical consistency. This makes the method well suited for scalable OPF dataset generation and practical power system learning tasks. We release the implementation code at https://github.com/PSquare-Lab/DDIM_OPF.</description>

      <title>ProOPF: Benchmarking and Improving LLMs for Professional-Grade Power Systems Optimization Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.</description>

      <title>Impact of Physics-Informed Features on Neural Network Complexity for Li-ion Battery Voltage Prediction in Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Aircrafts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft demands high-fidelity battery management systems capable of predicting voltage response under aggressive power dynamics. While data-driven models offer high accuracy, they often require complex architectures and extensive training data. Conversely, equivalent circuit models (ECMs), such as the second-order model, offer physical interpretability but struggle with high C-rate non-linearities. This paper investigates the impact of integrating physics-based information into data-driven surrogate models. Specifically, we evaluate whether physics-informed features allow for the simplification of neural network architectures without compromising accuracy. Using the open-source electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) battery dataset, we compare pure data-driven models against physics-informed data models. Results demonstrate that physics-informed models achieve comparable accuracy to complex pure data-driven models while using up to 75% fewer trainable parameters, significantly reducing computational overhead for potential on-board deployment.</description>

      <title>Power Reserve Procurement Considering Dependent Random Variables with PCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for the modelling of dependent random variables using generalised polynomial chaos. This allows to write chance-constrained optimization problems with respect to a joint distribution modelling dependencies between different stochastic inputs. Arbitrary dependencies are modelled by using Gaussian copulas to construct the joint distribution. The paper exploits the problem structure and develops suitable transformations to ensure tractability. The proposed method is applied to a probabilistic power reserve procurement problem. The effectiveness of the method to capture dependencies is shown by comparing the approach with a standard approach considering independent random variables.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Implicit Time-Invariant Max-Min-Plus-Scaling Discrete-Event Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Max-min-plus-scaling (MMPS) systems generalize max-plus, min-plus and max-min-plus models with more flexibility in modelling discrete-event dynamics. Especially, implicit MMPS models capture a wide range of real world discrete-event applications. This article analyzes the dynamics of an autonomous, time-invariant implicit MMPS system in a discrete-event framework. First, we provide sufficient conditions under which an implicit MMPS system admits at least one solution to its state-space representation. Then, we analyze its global behavior by determining the key parameters; the growth rates and fixed points. For a solvable MMPS system, we assess the local behavior of the system around its set of fixed points via a normalization procedure. Further, we present the notion of stability for the normalized system. A case study of the urban railway network substantiates the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>When control meets large language models: From words to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are transforming engineering and technology through enhanced control capabilities and decision support, they are simultaneously evolving into complex dynamical systems whose behavior must be regulated. This duality highlights a reciprocal connection in which prompts support control system design while control theory helps shape prompts to achieve specific goals efficiently. In this study, we frame this emerging interconnection of LLM and control as a bidirectional continuum, from prompt design to system dynamics. First, we investigate how LLMs can advance the field of control in two distinct capacities: directly, by assisting in the design and synthesis of controllers, and indirectly, by augmenting research workflows. Second, we examine how control concepts help LLMs steer their trajectories away from undesired meanings, improving reachability and alignment via input optimization, parameter editing, and activation-level interventions. Third, we look into deeper integrations by treating LLMs as dynamic systems within a state-space framework, where their internal representations are closely linked to external control loops. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future research directions to understand LLM behavior and develop interpretable and controllable LLMs that are as trustworthy and robust as their electromechanical counterparts, thereby ensuring they continue to support and safeguard society.</description>

      <title>Real-world energy data of 200 feeders from low-voltage grids with metadata in Germany over two years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last mile of the distribution grid is crucial for a successful energy transition, as more low-carbon technology like photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and electric vehicle chargers connect to the low-voltage grid. Despite considerable challenges in operation and planning, researchers often lack access to suitable low-voltage grid data. To address this, we present the FeederBW dataset with data recorded by the German distribution system operator Netze BW. It offers real-world energy data from 200 low-voltage feeders over two years (2023-2025) with weather information and detailed metadata, including changes in low-carbon technology installations. The dataset includes feeder-specific details such as the number of housing units, installed power of low-carbon technology, and aggregated industrial energy data. Furthermore, high photovoltaic feed-in and one-minute temporal resolution makes the dataset unique. FeederBW supports various applications, including machine learning for load forecasting, conducting non-intrusive load monitoring, generating synthetic data, and analyzing the interplay between weather, feeder measurements, and metadata. The dataset reveals insightful patterns and clearly reflects the growing impact of low-carbon technology on low-voltage grids.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Set-Based Observers for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set-based state estimation computes sets of states consistent with a system model given bounded sets of disturbances and noise. Bounding the set of states is crucial for safety-critical applications so that one can ensure that all specifications are met. While numerous approaches have been proposed for nonlinear discrete-time systems, a unified evaluation under comparable conditions is lacking. This paper reviews and implements a representative selection of set-based observers within the CORA framework. To provide an objective comparison, the methods are evaluated on common benchmarks, and we examine computational effort, scalability, and the conservatism of the resulting state bounds. This study highlights characteristic trade-offs between observer categories and set representations, as well as practical considerations arising in their implementation. All implementations are made publicly available to support reproducibility and future development. This paper thereby offers the first broad, tool-supported comparison of guaranteed state estimators for nonlinear discrete-time systems.</description>

      <title>Input-to-State Safe Backstepping: Robust Safety-Critical Control with Unmatched Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guaranteeing safety in the presence of unmatched disturbances -- uncertainties that cannot be directly canceled by the control input -- remains a key challenge in nonlinear control. This paper presents a constructive approach to safety-critical control of nonlinear systems with unmatched disturbances. We first present a generalization of the input-to-state safety (ISSf) framework for systems with these uncertainties using the recently developed notion of an Optimal Decay CBF, which provides more flexibility for satisfying the associated Lyapunov-like conditions for safety. From there, we outline a procedure for constructing ISSf-CBFs for two relevant classes of systems with unmatched uncertainties: i) strict-feedback systems; ii) dual-relative-degree systems, which are similar to differentially flat systems. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Timing-Based Attacks in Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time cyber-physical systems depend on deterministic task execution to guarantee safety and correctness. Unfortunately, this determinism can unintentionally expose timing information that enables adversaries to infer task execution patterns and carry out timing-based attacks targeting safety-critical control tasks. While prior defenses aim to obscure schedules through randomization or isolation, they typically neglect the implications of such modifications on closed-loop control behavior and real-time feasibility. This work studies the problem of securing real-time control workloads against timing inference attacks while explicitly accounting for both schedulability constraints and control performance requirements. We present a scheduling-based mitigation approach that introduces bounded timing perturbations to control task executions in a structured manner, reducing adversarial opportunities without violating real-time guarantees. The framework jointly considers worst-case execution behavior and the impact of execution delays on control performance, enabling the system to operate within predefined safety and performance limits. Through experimental evaluation on representative task sets and control scenarios, the proposed approach demonstrates that exposure to timing-based attacks can be significantly reduced while preserving predictable execution and acceptable control quality.</description>

      <title>Learnable Koopman-Enhanced Transformer-Based Time Series Forecasting with Spectral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified family of learnable Koopman operator parameterizations that integrate linear dynamical systems theory with modern deep learning forecasting architectures. We introduce four learnable Koopman variants-scalar-gated, per-mode gated, MLP-shaped spectral mapping, and low-rank Koopman operators which generalize and interpolate between strictly stable Koopman operators and unconstrained linear latent dynamics. Our formulation enables explicit control over the spectrum, stability, and rank of the linear transition operator while retaining compatibility with expressive nonlinear backbones such as Patchtst, Autoformer, and Informer. We evaluate the proposed operators in a large-scale benchmark that also includes LSTM, DLinear, and simple diagonal State-Space Models (SSMs), as well as lightweight transformer variants. Experiments across multiple horizons and patch lengths show that learnable Koopman models provide a favorable bias-variance trade-off, improved conditioning, and more interpretable latent dynamics. We provide a full spectral analysis, including eigenvalue trajectories, stability envelopes, and learned spectral distributions. Our results demonstrate that learnable Koopman operators are effective, stable, and theoretically principled components for deep forecasting.</description>

      <title>Sub-optimality bounds for certainty equivalent policies in partially observed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalization of the certainty equivalence principle of stochastic control. One interpretation of the classical certainty equivalence principle for linear systems with output feedback and quadratic costs is as follows: the optimal action at each time is obtained by evaluating the optimal state-feedback policy of the stochastic linear system at the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the state. Motivated by this interpretation, we consider certainty equivalent policies for general (non-linear) partially observed stochastic systems that allow for any state estimate rather than restricting to MMSE estimates. In such settings, the certainty equivalent policy is not optimal. For models where the cost and the dynamics are smooth in an appropriate sense, we derive upper bounds on the sub-optimality of certainty equivalent policies. We present several examples to illustrate the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of unknown, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments by an autonomous communication-aware and collaborative group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) presents significant challenges in coordination, perception, and decentralized decision-making. This paper implements Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these challenges in a 2D indoor environment, using high-fidelity game-engine simulations (Godot) and continuous action spaces. Policy training aims to achieve emergent collaborative behaviours and decision-making under uncertainty using Network-Distributed Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ND-POMDPs). Each UAV is equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and can share data (sensor measurements and a local occupancy map) with neighbouring agents. Inter-agent communication constraints include limited range, bandwidth and latency. Extensive ablation studies evaluated MARL training paradigms, reward function, communication system, neural network (NN) architecture, memory mechanisms, and POMDP formulations. This work jointly addresses several key limitations in prior research, namely reliance on discrete actions, single-agent or centralized formulations, assumptions of a priori knowledge and permanent connectivity, inability to handle dynamic obstacles, short planning horizons and architectural complexity in Recurrent NNs/Transformers. Results show that the scalable training paradigm, combined with a simplified architecture, enables rapid autonomous exploration of an indoor area. The implementation of Curriculum-Learning (five increasingly complex levels) also enabled faster, more robust training. This combination of high-fidelity simulation, MARL formulation, and computational efficiency establishes a strong foundation for deploying learned cooperative strategies in physical robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Decision Transformer for Traffic Coordination</title>

Abstract: Traffic signal control is a critical challenge in urban transportation, requiring coordination among multiple intersections to optimize network-wide traffic flow. While reinforcement learning has shown promise for adaptive signal control, existing methods struggle with multi-agent coordination and sample efficiency. We introduce MADT (Multi-Agent Decision Transformer), a novel approach that reformulates multi-agent traffic signal control as a sequence modeling problem. MADT extends the Decision Transformer paradigm to multi-agent settings by incorporating: (1) a graph attention mechanism for modeling spatial dependencies between intersections, (2) a|temporal transformer encoder for capturing traffic dynamics, and (3) return-to-go conditioning for target performance specification. Our approach enables offline learning from historical traffic data, with architecture design that facilitates potential online fine-tuning. Experiments on synthetic grid networks and real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate that MADT achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing average travel time by 5-6% compared to the strongest baseline while exhibiting superior coordination among adjacent intersections.</description>

      <title>How Does the Lagrangian Guide Safe Reinforcement Learning through Diffusion Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion policy sampling enables reinforcement learning (RL) to represent multimodal action distributions beyond suboptimal unimodal Gaussian policies. However, existing diffusion-based RL methods primarily focus on offline settings for reward maximization, with limited consideration of safety in online settings. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD), a novel algorithm for off-policy safe RL. By revisiting optimization theory and energy-based model, we show that the instability of primal-dual methods arises from the non-convex Lagrangian landscape. In diffusion-based safe RL, the Lagrangian can be interpreted as an energy function guiding the denoising dynamics. Counterintuitively, direct usage destabilizes both policy generation and training. ALGD resolves this issue by introducing an augmented Lagrangian that locally convexifies the energy landscape, yielding a stabilized policy generation and training process without altering the distribution of the optimal policy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that ALGD is both theoretically grounded and empirically effective, achieving strong and stable performance across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Human-Centric Traffic Signal Control for Equity: A Multi-Agent Action Branching Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating traffic signals along multimodal corridors is challenging because many multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches remain vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional discrete action spaces. We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings. This framework not only advocates for a fairer traffic signal system but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to varied urban traffic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study data-driven stabilization of continuous-time systems in autoregressive form when only noisy input-output data are available. First, we provide an operator-based characterization of the set of systems consistent with the data. Next, combining this characterization with behavioral theory, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the noisy data to be informative for quadratic stabilization. This condition is formulated as linear matrix inequalities, whose solution yields a stabilizing controller. Finally, we characterize data informativity for system identification in the noise-free setting.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Preserving Neural Architectures on Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preserving geometric structure is important in learning. We propose a unified class of geometry-aware architectures that interleave geometric updates between layers, where both projection layers and intrinsic exponential map updates arise as discretizations of projected dynamical systems on manifolds (with or without boundary). Within this framework, we establish universal approximation results for constrained neural ODEs. We also analyze architectures that enforce geometry only at the output, proving a separate universal approximation property that enables direct comparison to interleaved designs. When the constraint set is unknown, we learn projections via small-time heat-kernel limits, showing diffusion/flow-matching can be used as data-based projections. Experiments on dynamics over S^2 and SO(3), and diffusion on S^{d-1}-valued features demonstrate exact feasibility for analytic updates and strong performance for learned projections</description>

      <title>Joint Network-and-Server Congestion in Multi-Source Traffic Allocation: A Convex Formulation and Price-Based Decentralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an important rate allocation problem that arises in many networked and distributed systems: steady-state traffic rate allocation from multiple sources to multiple service nodes when both (i) the access-path delay on each source-node route is rate-dependent (capacity-constrained) and convex, and (ii) each service node (also capacity-constrained) experiences a load-dependent queueing delay driven by aggregate load from all sources. We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion.</description>

Abstract: We classify a family of matrices of shift operators that can be factorised in a computationally tractable manner with the Cholesky algorithm. Such matrices arise in the linear quadratic regulator problem, and related areas. We use the factorisation to uncover intrinsic sparsity properties in the control laws for transportation problems with an underlying tree structure. This reveals that the optimal control can be applied in a distributed manner that is obscured by standard solution methods.</description>

      <title>A necessary and sufficient condition for discrete-time consensus on star boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is intuitive and well known, that if agents in a multi-agent system iteratively update their states in the Euclidean space as convex combinations of neighbors' states, all states eventually converge to the same value (consensus), provided the interaction graph is sufficiently connected. However, this seems to be also true in practice if the convex combinations of states are mapped or radially projected onto any unit $l_p$-sphere or even boundaries of star-convex sets, herein referred to as star boundaries. In this paper, we present insight into this matter by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic consensus of the normalized states (directions) for strongly connected directed graphs, which is equivalent to asymptotic consensus of states when the star boundaries are the same for all agents. Furthermore, we show that when asymptotic consensus occurs, the states converge linearly and the point of convergence is continuous in the initial states. Assuming a directed strongly connected graph provides a more general setting than that considered, for example, in gradient-based consensus protocols, where symmetric graphs are assumed. Illustrative examples and a vast number of numerical simulations showcase the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>LP-MPPI: Low-Pass Filtering for Efficient Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a widely used sampling-based approach for real-time control, valued for its flexibility in handling arbitrary dynamics and cost functions. However, it often suffers from high-frequency noise in the sampled control trajectories, which hinders the search for optimal controls and transfers to the applied controls, leading to actuator wear. In this work, we introduce Low-Pass Model Predictive Path Integral Control (LP-MPPI), which integrates low-pass filtering into the sampling process to eliminate detrimental high-frequency components and enhance the algorithm's efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, LP-MPPI provides direct and interpretable control over the frequency spectrum of sampled control trajectory perturbations, leading to more efficient sampling and smoother control. Through extensive evaluations in Gymnasium environments, simulated quadruped locomotion, and real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, we demonstrate that LP-MPPI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MPPI variants, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing control signal chattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach to the advanced control of continuous crystallization processes using model predictive control. We provide a tutorial introduction to controlling complex particle size distributions by integrating population balance equations with detailed models of various continuous crystallizers. Since these high-fidelity models are often too complex for online optimization, we propose the use of data-driven surrogate models that enable efficient optimization-based control. Through two case studies, one with a low-complexity system allowing direct comparison with traditional methods and another involving a spatially distributed crystallizer, we demonstrate how our approach enables real-time model predictive control while maintaining accuracy. The presented methodology facilitates the use of complex models in a model-based control framework, allowing precise control of key particle size distribution characteristics, such as the median particle size $d_{50}$ and the width $d_{90} - d_{10}$. This addresses a critical challenge in pharmaceutical and fine chemical manufacturing, where product quality depends on tight control of particle characteristics.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Approach for Microgrid Probabilistic Forecasting and Robust Operation via Decision-focused Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) introduces significant uncertainty and intermittency into microgrid operations, posing challenges to economic and reliable scheduling. To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Certainty-Equivalence Model Predictive Control: Stability, Performance, and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Handling model mismatch is a common challenge in model predictive control (MPC). While robust MPC is effective, its conservatism often makes it less desirable. Certainty-equivalence MPC (CE-MPC), which uses a nominal model, offers an appealing alternative due to its design simplicity and low computational costs. This paper investigates CE-MPC for uncertain nonlinear systems with multiplicative parametric uncertainty and input constraints that are inactive at the steady state. The primary contributions are two-fold. First, a novel perturbation analysis of the MPC value function is provided, without assuming the Lipschitz continuity of the stage cost, better tailoring the widely used quadratic cost and having broader applicability in value function approximation, learning-based MPC, and performance-driven MPC design. Second, the stability and performance analysis of CE-MPC are provided, quantifying the suboptimality of CE-MPC compared to the infinite-horizon optimal controller with perfect model knowledge. The results provide insights in how the prediction horizon and model mismatch jointly affect stability and the worst-case performance. Furthermore, the general results are specialized to linear quadratic control, and a competitive ratio bound is derived, serving as the first competitive-ratio bound for MPC of uncertain linear systems with input constraints and multiplicative uncertainty.</description>

      <title>MSACL: Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates for Exponentially Stabilizing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For safety-critical applications, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) faces numerous challenges, particularly the difficulty of establishing verifiable stability guarantees while maintaining high exploration efficiency. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates (MSACL), a novel approach that seamlessly integrates exponential stability with maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MERL). In contrast to existing methods that rely on complex reward engineering and single-step constraints, MSACL utilizes intuitive rewards and multi-step data for actor-critic learning. Specifically, we first introduce Exponential Stability Labels (ESLs) to categorize samples and propose a $\lambda$-weighted aggregation mechanism to learn Lyapunov certificates. Leveraging these certificates, we then develop a stability-aware advantage function to guide policy optimization, thereby ensuring rapid Lyapunov descent and robust state convergence. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, comprising four stabilization and two high-dimensional tracking tasks. Experimental results demonstrate its consistent superiority over both standard RL baselines and state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. Beyond rapid convergence, MSACL exhibits significant robustness against environmental uncertainties and remarkable generalization to unseen reference signals. The source code and benchmarking environments are available at \href{https://github.com/YuanZhe-Xing/MSACL}{https://github.com/YuanZhe-Xing/MSACL}.</description>

      <title>DCoPilot: Generative AI-Empowered Policy Adaptation for Dynamic Data Center Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern data centers (DCs) hosting artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated devices operate at high power densities with rapidly varying workloads, making minute-level adaptation essential for safe and energy-efficient operation. However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.</description>

      <title>Online Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Controllers for Autonomous Driving via Real-Time Recurrent RL</title>

Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.</description>
