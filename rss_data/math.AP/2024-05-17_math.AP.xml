      <title>Geometric Analysis of Energy Minimizing Maps: Tangent Maps and Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy minimizing maps (E.M.M.s) play a central role in the calculus of variations, partial differential equations (PDEs), and geometric analysis. These maps are often embedded into $C^\infty$ Riemannian manifolds to minimize the Dirichlet Energy functional under certain prescribed conditions. For understanding physical phenomena where systems naturally evolve to states of minimal energy, the geometric analysis of these maps has provided elucidating insights. This paper explores the geometric and analytic properties of energy minimizing maps, tangent maps, and the singular set (sing(u)). We begin by establishing key concepts from analysis, including the Sobolev Space $W^{1,2}$ harmonic functions, and Hausdorff dimension. Significant results about the density function, its upper semi-continuity, and the compactness theorem for tangent maps, and theorems for homogeneous degree zero minimizers are presented. Also analyzed in detail is the singular set (sing(u)), its Hausdorff dimension, and geometric structure. We conclude with open problems that are rich in research potential, and the far-reaching implications if these problems are to be solved.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of non-local energies on disconnected sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the homogenization of non-local quadratic energies defined on $\delta$-periodic disconnected sets defined by a double integral, depending on a kernel concentrated at scale $\varepsilon$. For kernels with unbounded support we show that we may have three regimes: (i) $\varepsilon&lt;\!&lt;\delta$, for which the $\Gamma$-limit even in the strong topology of $L^2$ is $0$; (ii) $\frac\varepsilon\delta\to\kappa$, in which the energies are coercive with respect to a convergence of interpolated functions, and the limit is governed by a non-local homogenization formula parameterized by $\kappa$; (iii) $\delta&lt;\!&lt;\varepsilon$, for which the $\Gamma$-limit is computed with respect to a coarse-grained convergence and exhibits a separation-of-scales effect; namely, it is the same as the one obtained by formally first letting $\delta\to 0$ (which turns out to be a pointwise weak limit, thanks to an iterated use of Jensen's inequality), and then, noting that the outcome is a nonlocal energy studied by Bourgain, Brezis and Mironescu, letting $\varepsilon\to0$. A slightly more complex description is necessary for case (ii) if the kernel is compactly supported.</description>

      <title>Remark on the scattering theory of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{T}$. In the long range case, we show there is no linear scattering state of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{T}$. In the short range case, we show the decay and scattering of solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{T}$ for small data.</description>

      <title>Attainability of the best constant of Hardy-Sobolev inequality with full boundary singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a type of Hardy-Sobolev inequality, whose weight function is singular on the whole domain boundary. We are concerned with the attainability of the best constant of such inequality. In dimension two, we link the inequality to a conformally invariant one using the conformal radius of the domain. The best constant of such inequality on a smooth bounded domain is achieved if and only if the domain is non-convex. In higher dimensions, the best constant is achieved if the domain has negative mean curvature somewhere. If the mean curvature vanishes but is non-umbilic somewhere, we also establish the attainability for some special cases. In the other direction, we also show the best constant is not achieved if the domain is sufficiently close to a ball in $C^2$ sense.</description>

      <title>On the scalar curvature rigidity for mainifolds with non-positive Yamabe invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study scalar curvature rigidity of non-smooth metrics on smooth manifolds with non-positive Yamabe invariant. We prove that if the scalar curvature is not less than the Yamabe invariant in distributional sense, then the manifold must be isometric to an Einstein manifold. This result extends Theorem 1.4 in Jiang, Sheng and the first author (Sci. China Math. 66 (2023) no. 6, 1141-1160), from a special case where the manifolds have zero Yamabe invariant to general cases where the manifolds have non-positive Yamabe invariant. This result depends highly on an analysis and estimates of geometric evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Boundary Hardy inequality on functions of bounded variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical boundary Hardy inequality, that goes back to 1988, states that if $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty, \ ~\Omega$ is bounded Lipschitz domain, then for all $u \in C^{\infty}_{c}(\Omega)$, $$\int_{\Omega} \frac{|u(x)|^{p}}{\delta^{p}_{\Omega}(x)} dx \leq C\int_{\Omega} |\nabla u(x) |^{p}dx,$$ where $\delta_\Omega(x)$ is the distance function from $\Omega^c$. In this article, we address the long standing open question on the case $p=1$ by establishing appropriate boundary Hardy inequalities in the space of functions of bounded variation. We first establish appropriate inequalities on fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s,1}(\Omega)$ and then Brezis, Bourgain and Mironescu's result on limiting behavior of fractional Sobolev spaces as $s\rightarrow 1^{-}$ plays an important role in the proof. Moreover, we also derive an infinite series Hardy inequality for the case $p=1$.</description>

      <title>The time fractional order derivative for multi-class AR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a multi-class Aw-Rascle \textrm{(AR)} model with time fractional order derivative is presented. The conservative form of the proposed model is considered for the natural extension and generalization of equations involved. The fractional order derivative involved in the model equations is computed by applying the Caputo fractional derivative definition. An explicit difference scheme is obtained through finite difference method of discretization. The scheme is shown to be consistent, conditionally stable and convergent. Numerical flux is computed by original Roe decomposition and an entropy condition applied to the Roe decomposition. From numerical results, the effect of fractional-order derivative of time, on the traffic flow of vehicle classes is determined. Results obtained from the proposed model remain within limits therefore, they are realistic.</description>

      <title>On a compressible fluid-structure interaction problem with slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system describing the compressible barotropic fluids interacting with (visco) elastic solid shell/plate. In particular, the elastic structure is part of the moving boundary of the fluid, and the Navier-slip type boundary condition is taken into account. Depending on the reference geometry (flat or not), we show the existence of weak solutions to the coupled system provided the adiabatic exponent satisfies $\gamma &gt; \frac{12}{7}$ without damping and $\gamma &gt; \frac{3}{2}$ with structure damping, utilizing the domain extension and regularization approximation. Moreover, via a modified relative entropy method in time-dependent domains, we prove the weak-strong uniqueness property of weak solutions. Finally, we give a rigorous justification of the incompressible inviscid limit of the compressible fluid-structure interaction problem with a flat reference geometry, in the regime of low Mach number, high Reynolds number, and well-prepared initial data. As a byproduct, by low Mach number we also derive the incompressible limit with reduced assumptions on the regularity of the structure but with a stronger assumption on the exponent of $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Fujita-Kato solutions and optimal time decay for the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system in the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the construction of global-in-time strong solutions for the incompressible Vlasov-Navier-Stokes systemin the whole three-dimensional space. One of our goals is to establish that small initial velocities with critical Sobolev regularity  and sufficiently well localized initial kinetic distribution functions give rise to global and unique solutions. This constitutes an extension of the celebrated result for the incompressibleNavier-Stokes equations (NS) that has been established in 1964 by  Fujita and  Kato. If in addition the initial velocity is integrable, we establish that  the total energy of the system decays  to 0 with the optimal rate t^{-3/2}, like for the weak  solutions of (NS).    Our results partly rely on the use  of  a higher order energy functional that controls  the regularity $H^1$ of the velocityand seems to have been first introduced  by Li,  Shou and  Zhang  in the contextof  nonhomogeneous Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system.   In the small data case, we show that this energy functional  decays with  the  rate t^{-5/2}.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of the Dirac operator with position-dependent mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the homogenization of the two-dimensional Dirac operator with position-dependent mass. The mass is piecewise constant and supported on small pairwise disjoint inclusions evenly distributed along an $\varepsilon$-periodic square lattice. Under rather general assumptions on geometry of these inclusions we prove that the corresponding family of Dirac operators converges as $\varepsilon\to 0$ in the norm resolvent sense to the Dirac operator with a constant effective mass provided the masses in the inclusions are adjusted to the scaling of the geometry. We also estimate the speed of this convergence in terms of the scaling rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a thin elastic sheet with a finite number of disclinations in a variational framework in the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an approximation. Under the non-physical assumption that the out-of-plane displacement is a convex function, we prove that minimizers display ridges between the disclinations. We prove the associated energy scaling law with upper and lower bounds that match up to logarithmic factors in the thickness of the sheet. One of the key estimates in the proof that we consider of independent interest is a generalization of the monotonicity property of the Monge-Amp\`ere measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider Vlasov-type equations describing the evolution of single-species type plasmas, such as those composed of electrons (Vlasov-Poisson) or ions (screened Vlasov-Poisson/Vlasov-Poisson with massless electrons). We solve the final data problem on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, $d \geq 1$, by considering asymptotic states of regularity Gevrey-$\frac{1}{\gamma}$ with $\gamma&gt;\frac13$, small perturbations of homogeneous equilibria satisfying the Penrose stability condition. This extends to the Gevrey perturbative case, and to higher dimension, the scattering result in analytic regularity obtained by E. Caglioti and C. Maffei in [14], and answers an open question raised by J. Bedrossian in arXiv:2211.13707.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>

Abstract: Given a conformal metric with finite total Q-curvature on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq4$, we show that the sign of scalar curvature near infinity control not only the upper bound but also the lower bound of Q-curvature integral which is a new phenomenon. Meanwhile, for general complete non-compact four-manifolds with simple ends, we also obtain similar control of the lower bound of Q-curvature integral.</description>

      <title>Rapid stabilization and finite time stabilization of the bilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to establish the rapid stabilization of the bilinear Schr\"odinger control system and its linearized system, and the finite time stabilization of the linearized system using the Grammian operators. The analysis of the rapid stabilization involves a new quantity (variable) which is inspired by the adjoint state in the optimal control theory and is proposed in our recent work on control systems associated with strongly continuous group. The analysis of the finite time stabilization follows the strategy introduced by Coron and Nguyen in the study of the finite time stabilization of the heat equation and incorporate a new ingredient involving the estimate of the cost of controls of the linearized system in small time derived in this paper.</description>

      <title>Dirac operators on the half-line: stability of spectrum and non-relativistic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Dirac operators on the half-line, subject to generalised infinite-mass boundary conditions. We derive sufficient conditions which guarantee the stability of the spectrum against possibly non-self-adjoint potential perturbations and study the optimality of the obtained results. Finally, we establish a non-relativistic limit which makes a relationship of the present model to the Robin Laplacian on the half-line.</description>

      <title>On Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations with Nonhomogeneous Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of two isothermal, incompressible, immiscible fluids in a bounded domain is governed by Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations (CHNS System). In this work, we study the well-posedness results for the CHNS system with nonhomogeneous boundary condition for the velocity equation. We obtain the existence of global weak solutions in the two-dimensional bounded domain. We further prove the continuous dependence of the solution on initial conditions and boundary data that will provide the uniqueness of the weak solution. The existence of strong solutions is also established in this work. Furthermore, we show that in the two-dimensional case, each global weak solution converges to a stationary solution.</description>

      <title>Concentration limit for non-local dissipative convection-diffusion kernels on the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-local evolution equation on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^N$. We first consider a model for particle transport governed by a non-local interaction kernel defined on the tangent bundle and invariant under the geodesic flow. We study the relaxation limit of this model to a local transport problem, as the kernel gets concentrated near the origin of each tangent space. Under some regularity and integrability conditions on the kernel, we prove that the solution of the rescaled non-local problem converges to that of the local transport equation. Then, we construct a large class of interaction kernels that satisfy those conditions.
  We also consider a non-local, non-linear convection-diffusion equation on $\mathbb{H}^N$ governed by two kernels, one for each of the diffusion and convection parts, and we prove that the solution converges to the solution of a local problem as the kernels get concentrated. We prove and then use in this sense a compactness tool on manifolds inspired by the work of Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu.</description>

      <title>Regularity theory for parabolic operators in the half-space with boundary degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study elliptic and parabolic problems governed by the singular elliptic operators \begin{align*}
  \mathcal L=y^{\alpha_1}\mbox{Tr }\left(QD^2_xu\right)+2y^{\frac{\alpha_1+\alpha_2}{2}}q\cdot \nabla_xD_y+\gamma y^{\alpha_2} D_{yy}+Cy^{\alpha_2-1}D_y \end{align*} under Neumann boundary condition, in the half-space $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+=\{(x,y): x \in \mathbb{R}^N, y&gt;0\}$. We prove elliptic and parabolic $L^p$-estimates and solvability for the associated problems. In the language of semigroup theory, we prove that $\mathcal L$ generates an analytic semigroup, characterize its domain as a weighted Sobolev space and show that it has maximal regularity.</description>

      <title>Principal eigenvalue for some elliptic operators with large drift: Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the principal eigenvalue of some linear elliptic operators with drift in two dimensional space. We provide a refined description of the asymptotic behavior for the principal eigenvalue as the drift rate approaches infinity. Under some non-degeneracy assumptions, our results illustrate that these asymptotic behaviors are completely determined by some connected components in the omega-limit set of the system of ordinary differential equations associated with the drift term, which includes stable fixed points, stable limit cycles, hyperbolic saddles connecting homoclinic orbits, and families of closed orbits. Some discussions on degenerate cases are also included.</description>

      <title>Index estimates for sequences of harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study upper and lower bounds of the index and the nullity for sequences of harmonic maps with uniformly bounded Dirichlet energy from a two-dimensional Riemann surface into a compact target manifold. The main difficulty stems from the fact that in the limit the sequence can develop finitely many bubbles. We obtain the index bounds by studying the limiting behavior of sequences of eigenfunctions of the linearized operator and the key novelty of the present paper is that we diagonalize the index form of the Dirichlet energy with respect to a bilinear form which varies with the sequence of harmonic maps and which helps us to show the convergence of the sequence of eigenfunctions on the weak limit, the bubbles and the intermediate neck regions.
  Finally, we sketch how to modify our arguments in order to also cover the more general case of sequences of critical points of two-dimensional conformally invariant variational problems.</description>

      <title>Edge states in super honeycomb structures with PT_]-symmetric deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of edge states is one of the most vital properties of topological insulators. Although tremendous success has been accomplished in describing and explaining edge states associated with PT symmetry breaking, little work has been done on PT symmetry preserving cases. Two-dimensional Schroedinger operators with super honeycomb lattice potentials always have double Dirac cones at the Gamma point - the zero momentum point on their energy bands due to C6 symmetry, PT symmetry, and the "folding" symmetry - caused by an additional translation symmetry. There are two topologically different ways to deform such a system by PT symmetry preserving but folding symmetry breaking perturbations. Interestingly, there exist two gapped edge states on the interface between such two kinds of perturbed materials. In this paper, we illustrate the existence of such PT preserving edge states rigorously for the first time. We use a domain wall modulated Schroedinger operator to model the phenomenon under small perturbations and rigorously prove the existence of two gapped edge states. We also provide a brief interpretation from the point of view of "topology" by the parities of degenerate bulk modes. Our work thoroughly explains the existence of "helical" like edge states in super honeycomb configurations and lays a foundation for the descriptions of topologies of such systems.</description>
