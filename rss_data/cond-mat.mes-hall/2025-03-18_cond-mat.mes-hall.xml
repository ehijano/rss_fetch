      <title>Quantum Hall effect in a chiral cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of quantum fluctuations in a chiral cavity on the quantum Hall (QH) state, extending previous studies of QH liquids in linearly polarized cavities. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for perturbative cavity-matter interaction, we identify the system's normal modes, which correspond to the elementary excitations of the dressed electrons and photons. In contrast to the linear case, we find that the chiral cavity modifies the Kohn mode frequency by a contribution proportional to the cyclotron frequency, which can be interpreted as a renormalization of the magnetic field by cavity fluctuations. We show that the AC conductivities display cavity-induced corrections, including an isotropic quantum reactance effect and a rotating total-current response under applied AC fields. These findings are also derived from a hydrodynamic approach, which extends their validity to fractional quantum Hall states. Finally, we examine the role of finite cavity quality factor and find that while photon losses introduce resistive contributions to the impedance, these vanish in the DC limit. Our results provide insights into the interplay between quantum Hall states and chiral cavities, with significant implications for material engineering and cavity-induced topological effects.</description>

      <title>Mechanical resonant sensing of spin texture dynamics in a two-dimensional antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between the spin degrees of freedom and macroscopic mechanical motions, including striction, shearing, and rotation, has attracted wide interest with applications in actuation, transduction, and information processing. Experiments so far have established the mechanical responses to the long-range ordered or isolated single spin states. However, it remains elusive whether mechanical motions can couple to a different type of magnetic structure, the non-collinear spin textures, which exhibit nanoscale spatial variations of spin (domain walls, skyrmions, etc.) and are promising candidates to realize high-speed computing devices. Here, we report the detection of collective spin texture dynamics with nanoelectromechanical resonators made of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnPS3 with $10^{-9}$ strain sensitivity. By examining radio frequency mechanical oscillations under magnetic fields, new magnetic transitions were identified with sharp dips in resonant frequency. They are attributed to the collective AFM domain wall motions as supported by the analytical modeling of magnetostriction and large-scale spin-dynamics simulations. Additionally, an abnormally large modulation in the mechanical nonlinearity at the transition field infers a fluid-like response due to the ultrafast domain motion. Our work establishes a strong coupling between spin texture and mechanical dynamics, laying the foundation for electromechanical manipulation of spin texture and developing quantum hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable resonant s-p mixing of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Exchange-Coupled Spins for Robust High-Temperature Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Heisenberg exchange interactions between the neighboring spins comprising an ensemble spin qubit (E-qubit) can act as an intrinsic error mitigator, increasing gate fidelity even at high temperatures. As an example, the fidelity of a {\pi} gate applied to E-qubits above 1 K was studied by tuning the ferromagnetic exchange strength to show an exchange coupled E-qubit exhibits higher fidelity than a single-spin based qubit. We also investigate the coherence properties of E-qubits and find that the coherence time of an E-qubit extends linearly with the number of spins in the ensemble. This suggests that exchange interactions effectively suppress decoherence induced by thermal noise, achieving a coherence time greater than 1 ms at 1 K with an ensemble of only seven spins. Additionally, the ferromagnetic isotropic exchange prevents fidelity loss induced by spatial field gradients/inhomogeneity in Zeeman and/or control fields. Therefore, exchange-coupled spin qubits could enable fault-tolerant quantum operations and long-coherence times at elevated temperatures (&gt;1 K).</description>

      <title>Single-step high-fidelity three-qubit gates by anisotropic chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Spin orientation by electric current in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the flow of electric current in an altermagnet results in the formation of a homogeneous electron spin orientation in the sample. The spin of the conduction electrons generated in altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-momentum couplings, is quadratic in the current magnitude, varies as the second angular harmonic under variation of the current direction and does not require broken inversion symmetry. The effect is thus distinct from conventional current induced spin polarization phenomena which are linear in the current, vary as a first angular harmonic under variation of current direction and require broken inversion symmetry. The current-induced spin orientation in altermagnets is obtained using the kinetic theory for distribution functions in the spin-splitted subbands. It is shown that an application of external magnetic field significantly enhances the electron spin.</description>

      <title>Strongly-anharmonic gateless gatemon qubits based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gatemon qubits, made of transparent super-semi Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such "gateless gatemon" qubits can be driven with Rabi frequencies more than 100 MHz, enabling gate operations much faster than what is possible with traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our gateless gatemons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent super-semi junctions bring to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Low-energy insulating reconstructions of Si(111)-7x7 surface with and without stacking fault discovered by graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 7x7 reconstruction of Si(111) surface is one of the most fascinating configuration in nature, whose STM image has been well-understood by the famous dimer-adatom-stacking-fault model (DAS). However, the electronic property of the DAS model is always confirmed to be metallic by first-principles calculations, while some experiments detected insulating features. It is still challenge to predict DAS-like reconstructions through traditional method to solve such a puzzle. Here, we show that 7x7 reconstructions can be quickly discovered by graph theory as implemented in the graph-space based RG2 code for crystal structure prediction. Two groups of reconstructions with (DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B and DAS-d8-T6H6) and without (AB-d10-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3) stacking-fault are discovered. They possess energetic stabilities comparable to the well-known DAS (DAS-d8-T12) and show similar STM patterns, providing a plausible explanation for the experimentally observed 7x7 reconstruction on the Si(111) surface. The first-principles calculations show that DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T6H6, AB-d10-T12, and AA-d10-T12 are metallic, while DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B, AB-d10-T9H3 and AA-d10-T9H3 are insulating phases with gaps of 0.043 eV, 0.182 eV, 0.043 eV and 0.059 eV, respectively. Our work demonstrates the predictability of the Si(111)-7x7 reconstruction and provides the structural candidates for understanding the experimentally observed metal-to-insulator transition.</description>

      <title>Traveling antiferromagnetic domain walls in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an antiferromagnet in one space dimension with easy-axis anisotropy in a perpendicular magnetic field. We study propagating domain wall solutions that can have a velocity up to a maximum $v_c$. The width of the domain wall is a non-monotonic function of the velocity and it diverges to infinity at $v_c$. Both features are in contrast to the case of the Lorentz invariant model in the absence of the field. We further study the modification of the wall profile when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is added. Finally, we present a propagating spiral expected to form when the system is forced at a velocity higher than the maximum velocity for domain walls and we give numerical results for the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.</description>

      <title>Stability of Majorana modes in Coulomb-disordered topological insulator nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate theoretically the possibility to realize Majorana zero modes in hybrid devices made from topological-insulator (TI) nanowires proximity-coupled to a superconductor. Such systems have been suggested as building blocks of future topological quantum computers, as they have been predicted to realize Majorana zero modes protected by large gaps. A main obstacle is, however, the presence of a relatively large density of charged impurities, $n_\text{imp}\sim 10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$. Based on extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proximity to the superconductor leads to an efficient screening of the disorder potential. By analyzing the Majorana splitting energy, the size of the Andreev gap and the localization of edge modes, we show that robust Majorana modes can be realized for realistic levels of impurity concentrations and wire radii.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Nano-Imaging of Excitons in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb bound electron-hole pairs, dominate the optical response of two-dimensional semiconductors across near-infrared and visible frequencies due to their large binding energy and prominent oscillator strength. Previous measurements of excitons in 2D semiconductors have primarily relied on far-field optical spectroscopy techniques which are diffraction limited to several hundred nanometers. To precisely image nanoscale spatial disorder requires an order of magnitude increase in resolution capabilities. Here, we present a study of the exciton spectra of monolayer MoSe2 in the visible range using a cryogenic scattering-type scanning near field optical microscope (s-SNOM) operating down to 11 K. By mapping the spatial variation in the exciton resonance across an hBN encapsulated MoSe2 monolayer, we achieve sub-50 nm spatial resolution and energy resolution below 1 meV. We further investigate the material's near-field spectra and dielectric function, demonstrating the ability of cryogenic visible s-SNOM to reveal nanoscale disorder. Comparison to room temperature measurements illustrate the enhanced capabilities of cryogenic s-SNOM to reveal fine-scale material heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Engineering robust strain transmission in van der Waals heterostructure devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals materials provide a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena in solid state systems. Due to their remarkable mechanical strength, one enticing tuning knob is strain. However, the weak strain transfer of graphite and hBN, which are standard components of high-qualityvdW devices, poses fundamental challenges for high-strain experiments. Here, we investigate strain transmission in less-explored orthorhombic crystals and find robust transmission up to several percent at cryogenic temperatures. We further show that strain can be efficiently transferred through these crystals to other 2D materials in traditional heterostructure devices. Using this capability, we demonstrate in-situ strain and gate control of the optical properties of monolayer WS2 utilizing the high-\k{appa} dielectric insulator Bi2SeO5 as a substrate. These results enable the exploration of combined cryo-strain and gate tuning in a variety of layered systems such as moir\'e heterostructures, air-sensitive 2D magnets and superconductors, and any gated 2D device.</description>

      <title>Edge dependence of the Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime has attracted considerable attention, revealing the coexistence of two seemingly incompatible phases: the quantum Hall and superconducting states. However, the mechanism underlying the Josephson current remains unclear because of the observed h/2e magnetic interference period and the lack of precisely quantized Hall plateaus. To address this issue, we investigate the edge dependence of the Josephson current in graphene Josephson junctions operating in the quantum Hall regime. By systematically comparing devices with native, etched, edge-free, and gate-defined edges, we demonstrate that the Josephson current is confined to the physical edges and is highly sensitive to specific edge configurations. Our findings provide direct evidence that counter-propagating quantum Hall edge states mediate Andreev bound states, enabling Josephson coupling. These results clarify the underlying mechanism of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime and offer new strategies for engineering superconducting hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Extended Fractional Chern Insulators Near Half Flux in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Above the Magic Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of the fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by an interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1{\deg} hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3{\deg}, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37{\deg} twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moir\'e cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands, over unusually large ranges of density. This suggests a mechanism beyond disorder is stabilizing the fractional states. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of the cascade of Dirac resets observed in magic-angle samples near integer filling at zero field.</description>

      <title>Echo state property and memory capacity of artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing by using artificial spin ice (ASI) has been proposed on the basis of both numerical and experimental analyses. ASI is a many-body system consisting of ferromagnets with various interactions. Recently, fabricating magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as ferromagnets in an ASI was achieved in the experiment, which enables an electrical detection of magnetic state of each MTJ independently. However, performing a recognition task of time-dependent signal by such an MTJ-based ASI has not been reported yet. In this work, we examine numerical simulation of a recognition task of time-dependent input and evaluate short-term memory and parity-check capacities. These capacities change significantly when the magnitude of the input magnetic field is comparable to a value around which the magnetization alignment is greatly affected by the dipole interaction. It implies that the presence of the dipole interaction results in a loss of echo state property. This point was clarified by evaluating Lyapunov exponent and confirming that the drastic change of the memory capacities appears near the boundary between negative and zero exponents, which corresponds to the edge of echo state property.</description>

      <title>Switching on and off the spin polarization of the conduction band in antiferromagnetic bilayer transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic conductors with suitably broken spatial symmetries host spin-polarized bands, which lead to transport phenomena commonly observed in metallic ferromagnets. In bulk materials, it is the given crystalline structure that determines whether symmetries are broken and spin-polarized bands are present. Here we demonstrate experimentally that double-gate transistors realized on bilayers of van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS4 allow the relevant symmetry to be controlled by a perpendicular electric displacement field. Such a level of control enables the spin-polarization of the conduction band to be switched on and off. Because conduction band states with opposite spin-polarizations are hosted in the different layers and are spatially separated, these devices also give control over the magnetization of the electrons that are accumulated electrostatically. Our experiments show that double-gated CrPS4 transistors provide a viable platform to create gate-induced conductors with near unity spin polarization at the Fermi level, as well as devices with a full electrostatic control of the total magnetization of the system.</description>

      <title>High-performance and reliable probabilistic Ising machine based on simulated quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic computing with pbits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled pbits, and the energy minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.</description>

      <title>Gate electrode-induced nonreciprocal resistance in topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common method of controlling the chemical potential in topological insulators is applying a gate electrode. Simultaneously applying high source-drain bias currents can lead to parasitic effects in such devices. We derive that these parasitic effects lead to a gradient in the Hall effect along the current lead of a Hall bar. Consequently, nonreciprocal effects in both longitudinal and Hall voltages appear upon reversing the bias. These effects scale similarly to the magnetochiral anisotropy, requiring detailed analysis to make a distinction. Experimentally we show that nonreciprocal effects can appear in materials where magnetochiral anisotropy is not expected while a top gate is present. Without gate electrode, this nonreciprocal effect is found to be absent. These results show the importance of considering and, if possible, excluding gate electrode-induced effects when searching for nonreciprocal resistance intrinsic to a material.</description>

      <title>Negative Currents in Fabry-P\'erot Cavities are Caused by Interfering Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent electric current in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity can turn negative even if the time-dependent voltage is always positive. Here we present an analytic theory of this surprising phenomenon, showing that it is a purely quantum mechanical effect. It only occurs at low temperatures, and it is caused by interferences between paths through the cavity with different numbers of round trips. We provide realistic parameters for observing the negative currents in an experiment and show that a similar phenomenon is expected for the heat current, which may also turn negative.</description>

      <title>Emergent charge-transfer ferromagnetism and Fractional Chern states in moir\'e MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional moire materials present unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum phases of matter arising from the interplay of band topology and strong correlations.One of the most striking examples is the recent observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe2) with relatively large twist angles(~3.7deg-3.9deg). The electronic ground states are usually expected to be sensitive to the twist angle, as the twist angle determines the electron bandwidth and correlation strength in the moire system. Here, we report the observation of unexpected competing magnetic ground states in tMoTe2 moire superlattice, on which balance can be tipped by both twist angle and electric field (E). Specifically, we observed anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states with zero Hall resistance at both v_h=1 and 2/3, at intermediate twist angles ~3deg. The AFM orders are suppressed by applying vertical E, and emergent charge-transfer ferromagnetism accompanied by integer Chern insulator (ICI) or fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states are observed near the critical E (E_c) of moire superlattice symmetry transition. Our results demonstrate tMoTe2 as a fascinating platform for exploring unexpected correlated phases with nontrivial topology and fractional excitations and point to electric-field-controlled ultralow-power spin-valleytronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of condensed matter physics, time-reversal symmetry provides the foundation for a number of interesting quantum phenomena, in particular the topological materials and the quantum spin Hall physics that have been extensively studied in recent years. Here, based on the first-principles electronic-structure calculations, symmetry analysis, and model simulations, we demonstrate that time-reversal symmetry is not fundamentally necessary for the quantum spin Hall effect. In altermagnetic materials, as an alternative, it can also be protected by crystal symmetry, which can be referred to as the quantum crystal spin Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Wannier-Function-Based Approach to Coupled Exciton-Phonon-Photon Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marrying the predictive power of ab initio calculations with many-body effects remains a challenging task in two-dimensional (2d) materials, where efficient carrier-carrier interaction challenges established approximation schemes. In particular, understanding exciton-phonon interaction from first principles is a field of growing interest. Here, we present a many-body theory for coupled free-carrier, exciton, phonon and photon dynamics based on carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon interaction matrix elements obtained via projection on Wannier orbitals. The framework is applied to study the impact of carrier-phonon correlations on optical spectra and coupled nonequilibrium carrier-phonon kinetics in monolayer MoSe$_2$. We find that non-Markovian effects and dynamical buildup of quasi-particles are only properly described if correlations at least on the two-phonon level are included. Our studies open a perspective to advance the material-realistic description of nonequilibrium physics in 2d nanostructures to new many-body realms.</description>

      <title>Engineering Moir\'e Kagome Superlattices in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to achieve breathing kagome moir\'e superlattices using three twisted layers of transition metal dichalcogenides. In this scheme, the top and bottom layers are twisted relative to the middle layer by small angles $\theta$ and 2$\theta$ respectively, generating a kagome-like moir\'e potential for the middle layer with suitable parameters. The moir\'e band structures of these systems are calculated within the continuum model and show good resemblance to the breathing kagome band structure, including the flat band, Dirac points with tunable gap, and van Hove singularities. This system serves as a new venue to explore strongly correlated physics on kagome lattices which offers more flexibility and tunability in band structure, charge density, and interaction strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic topological phases of matter, characterized by robust boundary states derived from topologically nontrivial bulk states, are pivotal for next-generation electronic devices. However, understanding their complex quantum phases, especially at larger scales and fractional fillings with strong electron correlations, has long posed a formidable computational challenge. Here, we employ a deep learning framework to express the many-body wavefunction of topological states in twisted ${\rm MoTe_2}$ systems, where diverse topological states are observed. Leveraging neural networks, we demonstrate the ability to identify and characterize topological phases, including the integer and fractional Chern insulators as well as the $Z_2$ topological insulators. Our deep learning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, not only in computational efficiency but also in accuracy, enabling us to study larger systems and differentiate between competing phases such as fractional Chern insulators and charge density waves. Our predictions align closely with experimental observations, highlighting the potential of deep learning techniques to explore the rich landscape of topological and strongly correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</description>

      <title>Physicochemical Characterization of a New 2D Semiconductor Carbon Allotrope, C16: An Investigation via Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning-based Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study comprehensively characterizes, with suggested applications, a novel two-dimensional carbon allotrope, C$_{16}$, using Density Functional Theory and machine learning-based molecular dynamics. This nanomaterial is derived from naphthalene and bicyclopropylidene molecules, forming a planar configuration with sp$^2$ hybridization and featuring 3-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-membered rings. Cohesive energy of \SI{-7.1}{\electronvolt/atom}, absence of imaginary frequencies in the phonon spectrum, and the retention of the system's topology after ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm the structural stability of C$_{16}$. The nanomaterial exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a direct band gap of \SI{0.59}{\electronvolt} and anisotropic optical absorption in the $y$ direction. Assuming a complete absorption of incident light, it registers a power conversion efficiency of \SI{13}{\percent}, demonstrating relatively good potential for applications in solar energy conversion. The thermoelectric figure of merit ($zT$) reaches 0.8 at elevated temperatures, indicating a reasonable ability to convert a temperature gradient into electrical power. Additionally, C$_{16}$ demonstrates high mechanical strength, with Young's modulus values of \SI{500}{\giga\pascal} and \SI{630}{\giga\pascal} in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. Insights into the electronic, optical, thermoelectric, and mechanical properties of C$_{16}$ reveal its promising capability for energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential for Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Accurate Structural Relaxation and Emergent Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging ferroelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures are at the forefront of science and prospective technology. In moir\'e bilayers, twisting or heterostructuring causes local atomic reconstruction, which even at picometer scale, can lead to pronounced ferroelectric polarization. Accurately determining this reconstruction utilizing ab initio methods is unfeasible for the relevant system sizes, but modern machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a viable solution. Here, we present the Gaussian Approximation Potential for twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers validated against ab initio datasets. This approach enables the precise analysis of their structural properties, which is particularly relevant at small twist angles. We couple the structural information to a tight-binding model based on accurate interatomic positioning, and determine the twist-dependent polarization, yielding results that closely align with previous experimental findings - even at room temperature. This methodology enables further studies that are unattainable otherwise and is transferable to other 2D materials of interest.</description>

      <title>Anthraphenylenes: Porous 2D Carbon Monolayers with Biphenyl-Anthracene Frameworks and Type-II Dirac line nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon's versatility allows it to form diverse structures with unique properties, driven by its moderate electronegativity, small ionic radius, and ability to adopt \textit{sp}, \textit{sp\textsuperscript{2}}, and \textit{sp\textsuperscript{3}} hybridizations, individually or in combination. In this work, we introduce three novel 2D carbon allotropes -- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$-anthraphenylenes -- derived from biphenylene and Dewar-anthracene motifs, investigated through density functional theory calculations. Their thermodynamic and dynamic stability are confirmed by cohesive energy ($-7.02$ to $-7.26$ eV/atom), phonon dispersion, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The electronic structure analysis shows that all three anthraphenylenes display metallic behavior. All anthraphenylenes feature type-II Dirac Line Nodes (DLNs). Mechanical analysis highlights significant anisotropy, mainly in $\gamma$-anthraphenylene, which exhibits the highest rigidity. These monolayers feature a porous architecture with tunable mechanical properties, making them promising candidates for nanoelectronics and energy storage applications. By expanding the family of 2D carbon materials, anthraphenylenes provide new avenues for functional nanomaterial design.</description>

      <title>From 2D to 1D in beta-Naphthyne: A Porous Carbon Allotrope Merging Graphyne and Naphthylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials have attracted considerable interest due to their diverse structural and electronic properties, making them ideal for next-generation flat electronics. Among these materials, metallic-like porous structures offer advantages such as tunable charge transport and high surface area, which are essential for energy storage applications. In this study, we introduce beta-naphthyne, a novel 2D carbon allotrope composed of naphthyl units interconnected by octagonal rings. First-principles calculations confirm its dynamic and thermal stability, demonstrating its theoretical feasibility. Our results confirm its energetic, dynamic, and mechanical stability and its metallic nature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Young's modulus ranges from 46.60 N/m to 164.47 N/m, indicating an anisotropic mechanical response. Optical analysis reveals absorption activity in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) regions. The 1D structures were also analyzed, revealing a Dirac cone and a transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior. These findings establish beta-naphthyne as a promising material for energy storage and optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states of continuous Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the topological classification of continuous Hamiltonians that find applications in biased cold plasmas and photonics. Besides a magnetic bias, the Hamiltonians are parametrized by a plasma frequency and a fixed vertical wavenumber. Eight distinct phases of matter are identified as these parameters vary. When insulating gaps are shared by two such phases, asymmetric edge modes propagate along interfaces separating the two phases. Here we apply the notion of a bulk difference invariant (BDI) to this Hamiltonian, and show by numerical diagonalizations of interface Hamiltonians that after an appropriate regularization our BDI correctly predicts edge transport as described by a bulk edge correspondence. We also derive theoretical tools to compute the BDI and show the limitations of the bulk edge correspondence (BEC) when the phase transition is too singular.</description>

      <title>Dirac node pinning from Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a Kagome spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on the Kagome spin liquid candidate YCOB suggest the presence of Dirac fermionic spinons near the magnetization plateau at 1/9. Theories suggest that the spinons are charge neutral spin-$1/2$ excitations, in a $2\pi/3$ flux which triples the unit cell. Generally a gap is expected, and there is no symmetry protection for the Dirac nodes in this system. The question arises as to what causes the nodes and stabilizes them. In this work, we propose a node-creation and node-pinning mechanism driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Employing Gutzwiller-projected variational Monte Carlo calculations, we demonstrate that DM interactions induce a band closing phase transition in the spinon spectrum. There is a change in the Chern number when the bands are inverted. Together with the DM-generated internal gauge flux, the coupling to the spinon orbital magnetization counteracts the band reopening. This interplay energetically pins the Dirac nodes over a range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Periodic phase slips and frequency comb generation at tunable microwave frequencies in superconducting diabolo structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors are characterized by macroscopic phase coherence and have enabled cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies. Recent advances in 3D nanofabrication now offer possibilities for tuning functional properties relevant for on-chip 3D integration of superconductors. However, non-equilibrium phenomena in 3D nanostructures exposed to transport currents remain largeley unexplored. Here, we employ numerical simulations to investigate phase slips -- discrete $2\pi$ jumps in the phase of the superconducting order parameter -- in a tubular Nb superconductor with a central constriction, which is subjected to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) transport currents. We find that under DC drive, the system stabilizes periodic phase slips, resulting in GHz voltage oscillations. Introducing an additional AC frequency modulation generates microwave frequency combs which depend characteristically on the interaction between moving vortices and phase slips. Our findings open avenues for developing on-chip frequency comb generators in 3D cryoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-driven Topology via Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology and nonlinearity are deeply connected. However, whether topological effects can arise solely from the structure of nonlinear interaction terms, and the nature of the resulting topological phases, remain to large extent open questions. Here we consider a chain of parametrically-driven quantum resonators coupled only via weak nearest-neighbour cross-Kerr interaction, without any quadratic tunneling term. We show that, when the drive overcomes a critical threshold value, the system undergoes a transition from the atomic limit of decoupled oscillators to a symmetry-broken topological phase. The topology is dictated by the structure of the Kerr nonlinearity, yielding a non-trivial bulk-boundary correspondence. In the topological phase, we find different effective models for periodic and open boundary conditions and derive analytical approximations for the low-energy spectrum, identifying the conditions to observe topological edge modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-demand single-photon sources operating at telecom wavelengths are crucial for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate high-purity, indistinguishable single-photon generation in the telecom O-band from an InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot. We measured a single-photon purity of $g^2(0)=0.006(3)$ under aboveband excitation. Furthermore, we characterize two-photon interference via Hong-Ou-Mandel measurements and achieve a photon indistinguishability of $94.6\,\%$ with a temporal postselection of 100 ps time window and $5.58\,\%$ without temporal postselection. We measure a first-lens source efficiency of $\sim28\,\%$. These results highlight the potential of nanowire quantum dots as a promising source of telecom single photons for photonic quantum applications, offering deterministic positioning, efficient photon extraction, and scalable production.</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering Clock Transitions in Magnetic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study Floquet engineering of magnetic molecules via a time-periodic magnetic field that couples to the emergent total spin of the metal center. By focusing on an $S = 1$ electronic spin Hamiltonian containing the zero-field and Zeeman terms, we demonstrate significant continuous tunability of the low-lying energy levels. Remarkably, under the action of linearly polarized Floquet controls, all three energy levels retain their stability against variations in an external static magnetic field so that any pair of renormalized energy levels forms a clock transition qubit. This property is closely linked to having a net-zero total Zeeman shift, which results from both static and effective dynamical contributions. Further physical insights are obtained from an effective Hamiltonian, derived analytically from second order van Vleck degenerate perturbation theory. Based on our theoretical predictions, experimentalists will be able to dynamically tune qubit energy gaps to values that are useful in their specific laboratory settings, while retaining the spin decoherence suppressing effect of maintaining a clock transition.</description>

      <title>Unified evolutionary optimization for high-fidelity spin qubit operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing optimal strategies to calibrate quantum processors for high-fidelity operation is one of the outstanding challenges in quantum computing today. Here, we demonstrate multiple examples of high-fidelity operations achieved using a unified global optimization-driven automated calibration routine on a six dot semiconductor quantum processor. Within the same algorithmic framework we optimize readout, shuttling and single-qubit quantum gates by tailoring task-specific cost functions and tuning parameters based on the underlying physics of each operation. Our approach reaches systematically $99\%$ readout fidelity, $&gt;99\%$ shuttling fidelity over an effective distance of 10$\mu$m, and $&gt;99.5\%$ single-qubit gate fidelity on timescales similar or shorter compared to those of expert human operators. The flexibility of our gradient-free closed loop algorithmic procedure allows for seamless application across diverse qubit functionalities while providing a systematic framework to tune-up semiconductor quantum devices and enabling interpretability of the identified optimal operation points.</description>

      <title>Standardized test of many-body coherence in gate-based quantum platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence is a crucial resource in achieving quantum advantage over classical information processing, and more generally developing new quantum technologies. While its effects are observable in current quantum platforms, there are no standardized tools for systematically measuring and quantifying multi-qubit coherence across different gate-based quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a method to define a many-body quantum coherence length scale using anyon interference effects in a spin-chain setup, which effectively mirrors the problem of a quantum particle on a ring, with or without flux through it. We propose using the maximum length of the ring for which the presence or absence of flux can be clearly discerned, as a simple measure of the many-body quantum coherence grade (Q-grade) in a given quantum hardware. We demonstrate how this approach can be implemented on gate-based quantum platforms to estimate and compare the quantum coherence of current devices, such as those from Google, IBM, IonQ, IQM, and Quantinuum that we considered here. This work aims to contribute to the creation of a live Web interface where the latest developments and advancements can be demonstrated, and progress in quantum coherence resources tracked over time. Establishing such a standardized quantum test would enable monitoring the growth of quantum coherence in gate-based quantum platforms, in a spirit similar to Moore's law.</description>

      <title>Light-induced quantum friction of carbon nanotubes in water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum friction describes the transfer of energy and momentum from electronically excited states in a material to a surrounding solvent. Here, we show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit quantum friction in water. The diffusion constants of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solution decrease linearly by around 50 % with increasing excitation power. In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces. These findings establish that excitons in SWCNTs induce quantum friction in water.</description>

      <title>Velocity gauge formulation of nonlinear optical response in Floquet-driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the velocity gauge formalism, we develop a theoretical framework for computing the nonlinear optical responses of time-periodic quantum systems. This approach complements the length gauge formulation and offers distinct advantages in both numerical and analytical treatments, particularly for atomic and solid-state systems with well-defined momentum-space structures. By applying our framework to the Rabi model, we derive numerical solutions in the velocity gauge and compare them with the length gauge, demonstrating full agreement between the two formulations. Our findings reveal rich optical phenomena, including photon-assisted transitions, frequency mixing effects, and emergent Floquet-induced photocurrents that are absent in static systems. We demonstrate that nonlinear responses in Floquet-driven systems exhibit resonances at integer multiples of the driving frequency, providing insights into ultrafast spectroscopy and Floquet engineering of quantum materials. The present formulation establishes a bridge between theoretical models and experimental observations in driven quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum optics, photonics, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>A Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a robust quantum control framework that enables high-fidelity gate operations in semiconductor spin qubit systems with always-on couplings. Always-on interactions between qubits pose a fundamental challenge for quantum processors by inducing correlated errors that can trigger chaotic dynamics. Our approach suppresses both static coupling noise and time-dependent crosstalk without requiring high on/off ratio tunable couplers. Significantly, these pulses also prevent the emergence of chaotic entanglement growth in deep quantum circuits, preserving coherence in large multi-qubit systems. By relaxing hardware constraints on coupling control, our method provides a practical path toward scaling semiconductor quantum processors within existing fabrication capabilities, with particular relevance for silicon spin qubit architectures where high-contrast coupling modulation remains challenging.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanisms of flexoelectricity in oxide membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern electromechanical actuators and sensors rely on the piezoelectric effect that linearly couples strain and electric polarization. However, this effect is restricted to materials that lack inversion symmetry. In contrast, the flexoelectric effect couples strain gradients to electric polarization, and is a universal property in insulating materials of arbitrary symmetry. Flexoelectricity becomes prominent at the nanoscale from the inverse scaling of strain gradients with material dimensions. Here, we measure the strain-gradient-induced structural distortions in strontium titanate using multislice electron ptychography. This technique enables reliable picometer-scale measurements of the dominant oxygen-titanium distortions, correcting for artifacts that limited conventional imaging methods. This enables us to directly measure the sign of the net ionic contribution to the flexoelectric polarization. Guided by the experimental measurements, first-principles calculations show how the sign and magnitude of the bulk contribution to the flexoelectric coefficient in strontium titanate can be switched by tuning the strain state. Hybridization between the optical soft phonon and acoustic phonon modes drives this transition, yielding a large response and a polarity switch across the resonance. This strain-dependence might explain the sign discrepancy and orders of magnitude variation in the values of previously reported flexoelectric coefficients for strontium titanate. As the strain state of curved membranes can be tuned, our approach also suggests an approach to engineer nanoscale flexoelectric polarization using strain as a control parameter.</description>

      <title>Magnetization-induced symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortex. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe$_2$ have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe$_2$ with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction of UTe$_2$ (crystallographic a axis). Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the depth of the superconducting gap and the coherence peak on the one side of the vortex core are stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Considering the distribution of the magnetic field in the vortex, this symmetry breaking is due to the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe$_2$ and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Realization of fermionic Laughlin state on a quantum processor</title>

Abstract: Strongly correlated topological phases of matter are central to modern condensed matter physics and quantum information technology but often challenging to probe and control in material systems. The experimental difficulty of accessing these phases has motivated the use of engineered quantum platforms for simulation and manipulation of exotic topological states. Among these, the Laughlin state stands as a cornerstone for topological matter, embodying fractionalization, anyonic excitations, and incompressibility. Although its bosonic analogs have been realized on programmable quantum simulators, a genuine fermionic Laughlin state has yet to be demonstrated on a quantum processor. Here, we realize the {\nu} = 1/3 fermionic Laughlin state on IonQ's Aria-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using an efficient and scalable Hamiltonian variational ansatz with 369 two-qubit gates on a 16-qubit circuit. Employing symmetry-verification error mitigation, we extract key observables that characterize the Laughlin state, including correlation hole and chiral edge modes, with strong agreement to exact diagonalization benchmarks. This work establishes a scalable quantum framework to simulate material-intrinsic topological orders and provides a starting point to explore its dynamics and excitations on digital quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Slow Oscillations of the Transverse Magnetoresistance in HoTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance periodic in the inverse magnetic field with a frequency of 3.4 T have been identified in HoTe3. The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures. This may be attributed to the existence of soft modes in the system and allows the estimation of the electron scattering rate on these modes. In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.</description>

      <title>Study of Magnetic Field Resilient High Impedance High-Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators with high-kinetic inductance play a central role in hybrid quantum circuits, enabling strong coupling with quantum systems with small electric dipole moment and improved parametric amplification. However, optimizing these resonators simultaneously for high internal quality factors ($Q_i$) and resilience to strong magnetic fields remains challenging. In this study, we systematically compare superconducting resonators fabricated from niobium nitride (NbN) and granular aluminum (grAl) thin films, each having similar kinetic inductance values ($L_k \sim 100$ pH/sq). At zero magnetic field, resonators made from grAl exhibit higher $Q_i$ compared to their NbN counterparts. However, under applied magnetic fields, NbN resonators demonstrate significantly better resilience. Moreover, NbN resonators exhibit an unexpected increase in $Q_i$ at intermediate in-plane magnetic fields ($B_{\parallel} \sim 1$ T), which we attribute to an enhanced frequency detuning that reduce coupling to two-level system defects. In contrast, grAl resonators show a distinct critical field above which $Q_i$ rapidly decreases, strongly depending on resonator cross-section respect to the applied field direction. Characterization of the nonlinear properties at zero magnetic field reveals that the self-Kerr coefficient in grAl resonators is more than an order of magnitude higher than in NbN resonators, making grAl particularly attractive for applications requiring pronounced nonlinear interactions. Our findings illustrate a clear trade-off between the two materials: NbN offers superior magnetic-field resilience beneficial for hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics applications, while grAl is more advantageous in low-field regimes demanding high impedance and strong nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems can exhibit possibilities beyond what can be obtained in equilibrium. Both in Floquet systems and in the related problems of discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata, a basic distinction arises among unitary time evolution operators: while all physical operators are local, not all are locally generated (i.e., generated by some local Hamiltonian). In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence up to a locally generated unitary in all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We then classify noninteracting unitaries in all dimensions on this basis by showing that equivalence up to a locally generated unitary is identical to homotopy equivalence.</description>

      <title>Electrical Injection and Transport of Coherent Magnons in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-collinear antiferromagnets (nAFMs) with a small net magnetic moment offer new opportunities for ultrafast spintronic devices, owing to unique physical properties. While in ferromagnets and collinear AFMs the spin current polarization is locked to the magnetization $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ and N\'eel vector $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ directions, we predict that magnon spin currents injected by metal contacts into nAFMs can be polarized with both $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ components when carried by a coherent superposition of magnon eigenstates. The spin injection efficiency is governed by an interface spin conductance tensor that depends on the non-collinear magnetic texture. While the $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$-component diffuses freely into the nAFM, the $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$-component oscillates as a function of distance from the injector and applied magnetic field, analogous to the Hanle effect of electron spins in metals. Our findings reveal the potential of nAFMs as platforms for the study of tensorial coherent spin transport.</description>

      <title>Variational Mapping of Chern Bands to Landau Levels: Application to Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moir\'e bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moir\'e band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Effects of Strain Compensation on Electron Mobilities in InAs Quantum Wells Grown on InP(001)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: InAs quantum wells (QWs) grown on InP substrates are interesting for their applications in devices with high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and their potential role in creating topologically nontrivial hybrid heterostructures. These QWs rely on InGaAs cladding layers and InAlAs barrier layers to confine electrons within a thin InAs well. The highest mobility QWs are limited by interfacial roughness scattering and alloy disorder scattering in the cladding and buffer layers. Increasing QW thickness has been shown to reduce the effect of both of these scattering mechanisms. However, for current state-of-the-art devices with As-based cladding and barrier layers, the critical thickness is limited to $\leq7$ nm. In this report, we demonstrate the use of strain compensation techniques in the In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As cladding layers, grown on In$_{0.81}$Al$_{0.19}$As barrier layers, to extend the critical thickness well beyond this limit. We induce tensile strain in the InGaAs cladding layers by reducing the In concentration from In$_{0.81}$Ga$_{0.19}$As to In$_{0.70}$Ga$_{0.30}$As and we observe changes in both the critical thickness of the well and the maximum achievable mobility. The peak electron mobility at 2 K is $1.16\times10^6$ cm$^2/$Vs, with a carrier density of $4.2\times10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. Additionally, we study the quantum lifetime and Rashba spin splitting in the highest mobility device as these parameters are critical to determine if these structures can be used in topologically nontrivial devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring transport mechanisms in atomic precision advanced manufacturing enabled pn junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the different transport mechanisms that can occur in pn junction devices made using atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) at temperatures ranging from cryogenic to room temperature. We first elucidate the potential cause of the anomalous behavior observed in the forward-bias response of these devices in recent cryogenic temperature measurements, which deviates from the theoretical response of a silicon Esaki diode. These anomalous behaviors include current suppression at low voltages in the forward-bias response and a much lower valley voltage at cryogenic temperatures than theoretically expected for a silicon diode. To investigate the potential causes of these anomalies, we studied the effects of a few possible transport mechanisms, including band-to-band tunneling, band gap narrowing, potential impact of non-Ohmic contacts, band quantization, impact of leakage, and inelastic trap-assisted tunneling, through semi-classical simulations. We find that a combination of two sets of band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) parameters can qualitatively approximate the shape of the tunneling current at low bias. This can arise from band quantization and realignment due to the strong potential confinement in $\delta$-layers. We also find that the lower-than-theoretically-expected valley voltage can be attributed to modifications in the electronic band structure within the $\delta$-layer regions, leading to a significant band-gap narrowing induced by the high density of dopants. Finally, we extend our analyses to room temperature operation and predict that trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) facilitated by phonon interactions may become significant, leading to a complex superposition of BTBT and TAT transport mechanisms in the electrical measurements.</description>

      <title>Crowding Effects during DNA Translocation in Nanopipettes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quartz nanopipettes are an important emerging class of electric single-molecule sensors for DNA, proteins, their complexes as well as other biomolecular targets. However, in comparison to other resistive pulse sensors, nanopipettes constitute a highly asymmetric environment and the transport of ions and biopolymers can become strongly direction-dependent. For double-stranded DNA, this can include the characteristic translocation time and its tertiary structure, but as we show here, nanoconfinement can not only lead to unexplored features in the transport characteristics of the sensor, but also unlock new capabilities for biophysical and bioanalytical studies at the single-molecule level. To this end, we show how the accummulation of DNA inside the nanochannel leads to crowding effects, and in some cases reversible blocking of DNA entry, and provide a detailed analysis based on a range of different DNA samples and experimental conditions. Moreover, using biotin-functionalised DNA and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles as target, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study how the crowding effect, and the resulting increased residence time in nanochannel, can be exploited in a new analytical paradigm, involving DNA injection into the nanochannel, incubation with the nanoparticle target and analysis of the complex by reverse translocation. We thereby integrate elements of sample processing and detection into the nanopipette, as an important conceptual advance, and make a case for the wider applicability of this device concept.</description>

      <title>Tunable electron-electron interaction and anomalous enhancement of large-momentum scattering in moir\'e superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moir\'e graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stroboscopic non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of periodically kicked Hamiltonians involving homogeneous central-spin interactions. The system exhibits a strong fragmentation of Hilbert space into four-dimensional Floquet-Krylov subspaces, which oscillate between two disjointed two-dimensional subspaces and thus break the discrete time-translation symmetry of the system. Our analytical and numerical analyses reveal that fully polarized states of the satellite spins exhibit fragmentations that are stable against perturbations and have high overlap with Floquet eigenstates of atypically low bipartite entanglement entropy (scar states). Motivated by the breaking of discrete time translation symmetry by Floquet-Krylov subspaces, we introduce a novel type of time crystal that we call a ``subspace time crystal''. We present evidence of robust time-crystalline behavior in the form of a period doubling of the total magnetization of fully polarized satellite spin states that persists over long time scales. We compute non-equilibrium phase diagrams with respect to a magnetic field, coupling terms, and pulse error for various interaction types, including Heisenberg, Ising, XXZ, and XX. We also discuss possible experimental realizations of scar time crystals in color center, quantum dot, and rare-earth ion platforms.</description>

      <title>Robust boundary Luttinger surfaces in topological band structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18820v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that two phases with identical symmetries are separated by a bulk phase transition, while symmetry breaking provides a path in parameter space that allows adiabatic connection between the phases. Typically, if symmetry is broken only at the boundary, topological surface states become gapped, and single-particle surface properties no longer distinguish between the two phases. In this work, we challenge this expectation. We demonstrate that the single-particle surface Green's function contains zeros, or "Luttinger surfaces," which maintain the same bulk-boundary correspondence as topological surface states. Remarkably, these Luttinger surfaces persist under symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Moreover, we point out that low-energy and surface theories, often used synonymously in discussions of (gapped) topological matter, are actually different, with the difference captured by the Luttinger surfaces.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric Altermagnets: Antiferroelectricity Alters Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</description>

      <title>Engineering Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Tunnel Diode Oscillator for Qubit Readout Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed a tunnel diode oscillator and characterized its performance, highlighting its potential applications in the quantum state readout of electrons in semiconductors and electrons on liquid helium. This cryogenic microwave source demonstrates significant scalability potential for large-scale qubit readout systems due to its compact design and low power consumption of only 1 uW, making it suitable for integration on the 10 mK stage of a dilution refrigerator. The tunnel diode oscillator exhibits superior amplitude stability compared to commercial microwave sources. The output frequency is centered around 140 MHz, commonly used for qubit readout of electrons in semiconductors, with a frequency tunability of 10 MHz achieved using a varactor diode. Furthermore, the phase noise was significantly improved by replacing the commercially available voltage source with a lead-acid battery, achieving a measured phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum network for sensing in the acoustic frequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultimate limits for sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for a number of applications. Here we demonstrate a novel tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum, and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative- or positive-mass oscillator we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble allows to target quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of the broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational wave detectors. Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic intra-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>
