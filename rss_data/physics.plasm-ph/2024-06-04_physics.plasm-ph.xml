      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau (Coulomb, Fokker-Planck) collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator completely. Additionally, by considering the cases of self-collisions and $m_a\ll m_b$, we express all of the Braginskii transport coefficients through the Chapman-Cowling integrals as well. We thus offer a multi-fluid 22-moment model as well as the Braginskii model, which are valid for a large class of (elastic) collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. The particular collisional process - the hard spheres, the Coulomb collisions, the Maxwell molecules, the inverse interparticle force $\sim 1/r^\nu$ (or other cases not discussed here), are specified only at the end, by simply selecting few (pure) numbers. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic simulation of the spontaneous toroidal rotation of plasma in a stochastic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the DIII-D resonant magnetic perturbation experiment [Nucl. Fusion $\bm{59}$, 126010 (2019)] suggests that the neoclassical toroidal viscosity due to the collisional effects associated with the non-resonant magnetic perturbations is not enough to explain the observed toroidal rotation, it is of interest to investigate the toroidal rotation induced by the anomalous diffusion due to the resonant magnetic perturbations. Gyrokinetic simulation of the toroidal rotation of plasma in a stochastic magnetic field is carried out to investigate the resonant magnetic perturbations effects on toroidal rotation. The simulation results suggest that, in a stochastic magnetic field, resonant magnetic perturbations drive the plasma to toroidally rotate through the ambipolar radial electric field. It is found that this spontaneous flow driven on the time scale less than an ion-ion collision time is the parallel return flow of the $\bm{E}_r\times\bm{B}_0$ drift, which is due to the the ambipolar radial electric field induced by the non-ambipolar radial diffusion in the stochastic magnetic field. Collisional effect changes the plasma toroidal rotation from the return flow to the rigid-body flow after a few ion-ion collision times. The toroidal rotation observed in DIII-D resonant magnetic perturbation experiment [Nucl. Fusion $\bm{59}$, 126010 (2019)], can be explained by the rigid-body rotation driven by the ambipolar radial electric field generated by the stochastic magnetic field layer.</description>

      <title>Ohm's Law, the Reconnection Rate, and Energy Conversion in Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous plasma process that transforms magnetic energy into particle energy during eruptive events throughout the universe. Reconnection not only converts energy during solar flares and geomagnetic substorms that drive space weather near Earth, but it may also play critical roles in the high energy emissions from the magnetospheres of neutron stars and black holes. In this review article, we focus on collisionless plasmas that are most relevant to reconnection in many space and astrophysical plasmas. Guided by first-principles kinetic simulations and spaceborne in-situ observations, we highlight the most recent progress in understanding this fundamental plasma process. We start by discussing the non-ideal electric field in the generalized Ohm's law that breaks the frozen-in flux condition in ideal magnetohydrodynamics and allows magnetic reconnection to occur. We point out that this same reconnection electric field also plays an important role in sustaining the current and pressure in the current sheet and then discuss the determination of its magnitude (i.e., the reconnection rate), based on force balance and energy conservation. This approach to determining the reconnection rate is applied to kinetic current sheets of a wide variety of magnetic geometries, parameters, and background conditions. We also briefly review the key diagnostics and modeling of energy conversion around the reconnection diffusion region, seeking insights from recently developed theories. Finally, future prospects and open questions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability of Geodesic-Acoustic-Mode packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated, undamped geodesic-acoustic-mode (GAM) packets have been demonstrated to obey a (focusing) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) [E. Poli, Phys. Plasmas 2021]. This equation predicts susceptibility of GAM packets to the modulational instability (MI). The necessary conditions for this instability are analyzed analytically and numerically using the NLSE model. The predictions of the NLSE are compared to gyrokinetic simulations performed with the global particle-in-cell code ORB5, where GAM packets are created from initial perturbations of the axisymmetric radial electric field $E_r$. An instability of the GAM packets with respect to modulations is observed both in cases in which an initial perturbation is imposed and when the instability develops spontaneously. However, significant differences in the dynamics of the small scales are discerned between the NLSE and gyrokinetic simulations. These discrepancies are mainly due to the radial dependence of the strength of the nonlinear term, which we do not retain in the solution of the NLSE, and to the damping of higher spectral components. The damping of the high-$k_r$ components, which develop as a consequence of the nonlinearity, can be understood in terms of Landau damping. The influence of the ion Larmor radius $\rho_i$ as well as the perturbation wavevector $k_{\text{pert}}$ on this effect is studied. For the parameters considered here the aforementioned damping mechanism hinders the MI process significantly from developing to its full extent and is strong enough to stabilize some of the (according to the undamped NLSE model) unstable wavevectors.</description>

      <title>Regarding the extension of metaplectic geometrical optics to modelling evanescent waves in ray-tracing codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO) is a recently developed ray-tracing framework to accurately compute the wavefield behavior near a caustic (turning point or focal point), where traditional ray-tracing breaks down. However, MGO has thus far been restricted to having real-valued wavevectors. This is disadvantageous because often upon crossing a caustic from the `illuminated' region to the `shadow' region, two real-valued rays coalesce into one complex-valued ray corresponding to the transition from propagating to evanescent behavior; MGO is currently unable to model such a transition. One can distinguish caustics as having either `illuminated shadows' or `proper shadows' -- the former corresponds to when the caustic shadow still contains real-valued rays (albeit in a fewer quantity than in the illuminated region), while the latter corresponds to when the caustic shadow contains no real-valued rays. Here, by means of examples, we show how MGO can be used to model both types of caustic shadows. First, for illuminated shadows we show that MGO can actually be used `as is', provided a corrected quadrature-angle bias is used in the numerical implementation compared to that proposed in the original references. This is then implemented and demonstrated in a recently developed MGO ray-tracing code. Second, we show that for proper shadows, the MGO formalism can still be used provided that the symplectic rotation matrix used to remove caustics along the rays is allowed to be complex-valued. In both cases, strong agreement is seen between the MGO solution and the exact solution, demonstrating the potential of MGO for improving the predictive capability of ray-tracing codes, and laying the foundations for modeling more complicated evanescent phenomena such as tunnelling with MGO.</description>

      <title>Using Convolutional Neural Networks to detect Edge Localized Modes in DIII-D from Doppler Backscattering measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In H-mode tokamak plasmas, the plasma is sometimes ejected beyond the edge transport barrier. These events are known as edge localized modes (ELMs). ELMs cause a loss of energy and damage the vessel walls. Understanding the physics of ELMs and by extension, how to detect and mitigate them, is an important challenge. In this paper, we focus on two diagnostic methods $\unicode{x2013}$ D-alpha spectroscopy and Doppler backscattering (DBS). The former detects ELMs by measuring Balmer alpha emission while the latter uses microwave radiation to probe the plasma. DBS has the advantage of having higher temporal resolution and robustness to damage. These advantages of DBS diagnostics may be beneficial for future operational tokamaks and thus data processing techniques for DBS should be developed in preparation. In sight of this, we explore the training of neural networks to detect ELMs from DBS data, using D-alpha data as the ground truth. With shots found in the DIII-D database, the model is trained to classify each time step based on the occurrence of an ELM event. The results are promising. When tested on shots similar to those used for training, the model is capable of consistently achieving a high f1-score of 0.93. This score is a performance metric for imbalanced datasets that ranges between 0 and 1. We evaluate the performance of our neural network on a variety of ELMs $\unicode{x2013}$ grasssy, suppressed, and wide pedestal $\unicode{x2013}$ finding broad applicability. Beyond ELMs, our work demonstrates the wider feasibility of applying neural networks to data from DBS diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A Point-cloud Clustering &amp; Tracking Algorithm for Radar Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In data mining, density-based clustering, which entails classifying datapoints according to their distributions in some space, is an essential method to extract information from large datasets. With the advent of software-based radio, ionospheric radars are capable of producing unprecedentedly large datasets of plasma turbulence backscatter observations, and new automatic techniques are needed to sift through them. We present an algorithm to automatically identify and track clusters of radar echoes through time, using dbscan, a celebrated density-based clustering method for noisy point-clouds. We demonstrate its efficiency by tracking turbulent structures in the E-region ionosphere, the so-called radar aurora. Through conjugate auroral imagery, as well as in-situ satellite observations, we demonstrate that the observed turbulent structures generally track the motion of the aurora. We discuss instances when this prediction is brought to fruition and when it ostensibly is not. Through case studies, we highlight the important instances when the radar echo bulk motions vary considerably around discrete auroral arcs, an effect we argue is produced by strong electric field modulations caused by energetic particle precipitation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the role of cosmic-ray driven Alfv\'en waves in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. I. Turbulent damping rates and feedback on background fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves (AWs) excited by the cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instability (CRSI) are a fundamental ingredient for CR confinement. The effectiveness of self-confinement relies on a balance between CRSI growth rate and damping mechanisms acting on quasi-parallel AWs excited by CRs. One relevant mechanism is the so-called turbulent damping, in which an AW packet injected in pre-existing turbulence undergoes a cascade process due to its nonlinear interaction with fluctuations of the background. The turbulent damping of an AW packet in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is re-examined, revised, and extended to include most-recent theories of MHD turbulence that account for dynamic alignment and reconnection-mediated regime. The case in which the role of feedback of CR-driven AWs on pre-existing turbulence is important will also be discussed. Particular attention is given to the nonlinearity parameter $\chi^w$ that estimates the strength of nonlinear interaction between CR-driven AWs and background fluctuations. We point out the difference between $\chi^w$ and $\chi^z$ that instead describes the strength of nonlinear interactions between pre-existing fluctuations. When $\chi^w$ is properly taken into account, one finds that (i) the turbulent damping rate of quasi-parallel AWs in anisotropic turbulence depends on the background-fluctuations' amplitude to the third power, hence is strongly suppressed, and (ii) the dependence on the AW's wavelength (and thus on the CR gyro-radius from which it is excited) is different from what has been previously obtained. Finally, (iii) when dynamic alignment of cascading fluctuations and the possibility of a reconnection-mediated range is included in the picture, the turbulent damping rate exhibits novel regimes and breaks. Finally, a criterion for CR-feedback is derived and simple phenomenological models of CR-modified turbulent scaling are provided.</description>

      <title>The Maintenance of Coherent Vortex Topology by Lagrangian Chaos in Drift-Rossby Wave Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces the "potential vorticity bucket brigade," a mechanism for explaining the resilience of vortex structures in magnetically confined fusion plasmas and geophysical flows. Drawing parallels with zonal jet formation, we show how inhomogeneous patterns of mixing can reinforce, rather than destroy non-zonal flow structure. We accomplish this through an exact stochastic Lagrangian representation of vorticity transport, together with a near-integrability property, which relates coherent flow topology to fluid relabeling symmetries. We demonstrate these ideas in the context of gradient-driven magnetized plasma turbulence, though the tools we develop here are model-agnostic and applicable beyond the system studied here.</description>

      <title>Broadening of the Divertor Heat Flux Profile in High Confinement Tokamak Fusion Plasmas with Edge Pedestals Limited by Turbulence in DIII-D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00185v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-machine empirical scaling predicts an extremely narrow heat exhaust layer in future high magnetic field tokamaks, producing high power densities that require mitigation. In the experiments presented, the width of this exhaust layer is nearly doubled using actuators to increase turbulent transport in the plasma edge. This is achieved in low collisionality, high confinement edge pedestals with their gradients limited by turbulent transport instead of large-scale, coherent instabilities. The exhaust heat flux profile width and divertor leg diffusive spreading both double as a high frequency band of turbulent fluctuations propagating in the electron diamagnetic direction doubles in amplitude. The results are quantitatively reproduced in electromagnetic XGC particle-in-cell simulations which show the heat flux carried by electrons emerges to broaden the heat flux profile, directly supported by Langmuir probe measurements.</description>

      <title>Beam-driven Electron Cyclotron Harmonic and Electron Acoustic Waves as Seen in Particle-In-Cell Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent study has demonstrated that electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves can be excited by a low energy electron beam. Such waves propagate at moderately oblique wave normal angles (~70). The potential effects of beam-driven ECH waves on electron dynamics in Earth's plasma sheet is not known. Using two-dimensional Darwin particle-in-cell simulations with initial electron distributions that represent typical plasma conditions in the plasma sheet, we explore the excitation and saturation of such beam-driven ECH waves. Both ECH and electron acoustic waves are excited in the simulation and propagate at oblique wave normal angles. Compared with the electron acoustic waves, ECH waves grow much faster and have more intense saturation amplitudes. Cold, stationary electrons are first accelerated by ECH waves through cyclotron resonance and then accelerated in the parallel direction by both the ECH and electron acoustic waves through Landau resonance. Beam electrons, on the other hand, are decelerated in the parallel direction and scattered to larger pitch angles. The relaxation of the electron beam and the continuous heating of the cold electrons contribute to ECH wave saturation and suppress the excitation of electron acoustic waves. When the ratio of plasma to electron cyclotron frequency wpe/wce increases, the ECH wave amplitude increases while the electron acoustic wave amplitude decreases. Our work reveals the importance of ECH and electron acoustic waves in reshaping sub-thermal electron distributions and improves our understanding on the potential effects of wave-particle interactions in trapping ionospheric electron outflows and forming anisotropic (field-aligned) electron distributions in the plasma sheet.</description>

Abstract: Generation of quasi-monoenergetic ion pulse by laser-driven acceleration is one of the hot topics in laser plasma physics. In this study, we present a new method for the \textit{In-situ} deposition of an ultra-thin D$_2$O layer on the surface of an aluminum foil target utilizing a spherical D$_2$O capsule. Employing a 10$^{19}$ W/cm$^2$ laser, we achieve the acceleration of 10.8 MeV deuterons with an energy spread of $\Delta$E/E = 4.6% in the most favorable shot. The energy spread depends on the exposure time of the D$_2$O capsule in the vacuum chamber. This method has the potential to extend its applicability to other ion species.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework of Forced Magnetic Reconnection and Alfven Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unified linear theory that includes forced reconnection as a particular case of Alfv\'en resonance is presented. We consider a generalized Taylor problem in which a sheared magnetic field is subject to a time-dependent boundary perturbation oscillating at frequency $\omega_0$. By analyzing the asymptotic time response of the system, the theory demonstrates that the Alfv\'en resonance is due to the residues at the resonant poles, in the complex frequency plane, introduced by the boundary perturbation. Alfv\'en resonance transitions towards forced reconnection, described by the constant-psi regime for (normalized) times $t\gg S^{1/3}$, when the forcing frequency of the boundary perturbation is $\omega_0\ll S^{-1/3}$, allowing the coupling of the Alfv\'en resonances across the neutral line with the reconnecting mode, as originally suggested in [1]. Additionally, it is shown that even if forced reconnection develops for finite, albeit small, frequencies, the reconnection rate and reconnected flux are strongly reduced for frequencies $\omega_0\gg S^{-3/5}$.</description>

Abstract: Vacuum polarization (VP) is investigated for the interaction of a polarized $\gamma$-ray beam of GeV photons with a counterpropagating ultraintense laser pulse. In a conventional setup of a vacuum birefringence measurement, a VP signal is the emerging small circular (linear) polarization of the initially linearly (circularly) polarized probe photons. The pair production via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in such a high-energy environment eliminates part of the $\gamma$-photons in the outgoing $\gamma$-beam, increasing the statistical error and decreasing the accuracy of this VP signal. In contrast, we investigate the conversion of the emerging circular polarization of $\gamma$-photons into longitudinal polarization of the created positrons, considering the latter as the main VP signal. To study the VP effects in the highly nonlinear regime, where the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian method breaks down, we have developed a Monte-Carlo simulation method, incorporating vacuum birefringence and dichroism via the one-loop QED probabilities in the locally constant field approximation. Our Monte Carlo method will enable the study of VP effects in strong fields of arbitrary configuration. With 10~PW laser systems, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the fermionic signal of the VP effect at the 5$\sigma$ confidence level with a few hours of measurement time.</description>

Abstract: The formation of plasmons through the collective excitation of charge density has generated intense discussions, offering insights to fundamental sciences and potential applications. While the underlying physical principles have been well-established, the effects of many-body interactions and orbital hybridization on plasmonic dynamics remain understudied. In this work, we present the observation of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in epitaxial La1-xSrxNiO3 (LSNO) films with varying Sr doping concentrations (x = 0, 0.125, 0.25), unveiling their intriguing evolution. Unlike samples at other doping concentrations, the x = 0.125 intermediate doping sample does not exhibit the correlated plasmons despite showing high optical conductivity. Through a comprehensive experimental investigation using spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the O2p-Ni3d orbital hybridization for LSNO with a doping concentration of x = 0.125 is found to be significantly enhanced, alongside a considerable weakening of its effective correlation U*. These factors account for the absence of correlated plasmons and the high optical conductivity observed in LSNO (0.125). Our results underscore the profound impact of orbital hybridization on the electronic structure and the formation of plasmon in strongly-correlated systems. This in turn suggest that LSNO could serve as a promising alternative material in optoelectronic devices.</description>
