      <title>Inferring Message Flows From System Communication Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for automatically inferring message flow specifications from the communication traces of a system-on-chip (SoC) design that captures messages exchanged among the components during a system execution. The inferred message flows characterize the communication and coordination of components in a system design for realizing various system functions, and they are essential for SoC validation and debugging. The proposed method relieves the burden of manual development and maintenance of such specifications on human designers. Our method also uses a new accuracy metric, \emph{acceptance ratio}, to evaluate the quality of the mined specifications instead of the specification size often used in the previous work, enabling more accurate specifications to be mined. Furthermore, this paper introduces the concept of essential causalities to enhance the accuracy of the message flow mining and accelerate the mining process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic traces and traces generated from executing several system models in GEM5. In both cases, the proposed method achieves superior accuracies compared to a previous approach. Additionally, this paper includes some practical use cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RA is a software package that couples machine learning with formal reasoning in an attempt to find the laws that generate the empirical data that it has been given access to. A brief outline of RA in its initial stage of development is presented. Particular emphasis is given to current design strategies that aim to endow RA with the ability to construct its own conjectures of which it constructs proofs.</description>

      <title>Getting Wiser from Multiple Data: Probabilistic Updating according to Jeffrey and Pearl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In probabilistic updating one transforms a prior distribution in the light of given evidence into a posterior distribution, via what is called conditioning, updating, belief revision or inference. This is the essence of learning, as Bayesian updating. It will be illustrated via a physical model involving (adapted) water flows through pipes with different diameters.
  Bayesian updating makes us wiser, in the sense that the posterior distribution makes the evidence more likely than the prior, since it incorporates the evidence. Things are less clear when one wishes to learn from multiple pieces of evidence / data. It turns out that there are (at least) two forms of updating for this, associated with Jeffrey and Pearl. The difference is not always clearly recognised.
  This paper provides an introduction and an overview in the setting of discrete probability theory. It starts from an elementary question, involving multiple pieces of evidence, that has been sent to a small group academic specialists. Their answers show considerable differences. This is used as motivation and starting point to introduce the two forms of updating, of Jeffrey and Pearl, for multiple inputs and to elaborate their properties. In the end the account is related to so-called variational free energy (VFE) update in the cognitive theory of predictive processing. It is shown that both Jeffrey and Pearl outperform VFE updating and that VFE updating need not decrease divergence - that is correct errors - as it is supposed to do.</description>

      <title>Centralized vs Decentralized Monitors for Hyperproperties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the runtime verification of hyperproperties expressed in HypermuHML, an expressive yet simple logic for describing properties of sets of traces. To this end, we first consider a simple language of monitors that can observe sets of system executions and report verdicts w.r.t. a given HypermuHML formula. In this setting, a unique omniscient monitor observes all system traces, and, in this sense, it is 'centralized'. However, in a possibly distributed system, having a centralized entity is undesirable; hence, we also provide a language for 'decentralized' monitors, where each trace has its own monitor, and monitors for different traces can yield a unique verdict by communicating their observations. For both the centralized and the decentralized settings, we provide a synthesis procedure that, given a formula, yields a monitor that is correct (i.e., sound and violation complete). A key step in proving the correctness of the synthesis for decentralized monitors is a result showing that, for each formula, the synthesized centralized monitor and its corresponding decentralized one are weakly bisimilar for a suitable notion of weak bisimulation.</description>

      <title>Propositional dynamic logic and asynchronous cascade decompositions for regular trace languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a local, past-oriented fragment of propositional dynamic logic to reason about concurrent scenarios modelled as Mazurkiewicz traces, and prove it to be expressively complete with respect to regular trace languages. Because of locality, specifications in this logic are efficiently translated into asynchronous automata, in a way that reflects the structure of formulas. In particular, we obtain a new proof of Zielonka's fundamental theorem and we prove that any regular trace language can be implemented by a cascade product of localized asynchronous automata, which essentially operate on a single process.
  These results refine earlier results by Adsul et al. which involved a larger fragment of past propositional dynamic logic and used Mukund and Sohoni's gossip automaton. Our new results avoid using this automaton, or Zielonka's timestamping mechanism and, in particular, they show how to implement a gossip automaton as a cascade product.</description>

      <title>Using Color Refinement to Boost Enumeration and Counting for Acyclic CQs of Binary Schemas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an index structure, called the color-index, to boost the evaluation of acyclic conjunctive queries (ACQs) over binary schemas. The color-index is based on the color refinement algorithm, a widely used subroutine for graph isomorphism testing algorithms. Given a database $D$, we use a suitable version of the color refinement algorithm to produce a stable coloring of $D$, an assignment from the active domain of $D$ to a set of colors $C_D$. The main ingredient of the color-index is a particular database $D_c$ whose active domain is $C_D$ and whose size is at most $|D|$. Using the color-index, we can evaluate any free-connex ACQ $Q$ over $D$ with preprocessing time $O(|Q| \cdot |D_c|)$ and constant delay enumeration. Furthermore, we can also count the number of results of $Q$ over $D$ in time $O(|Q| \cdot |D_c|)$. Given that $|D_c|$ could be much smaller than $|D|$ (even constant-size for some families of databases), the color-index is the first index structure for evaluating free-connex ACQs that allows efficient enumeration and counting with performance that may be strictly smaller than the database size.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Description Logics for Global Explanations of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for node classification in graph-structured data, but they lack explainability, especially at the global level. Current research mainly utilizes subgraphs of the input as local explanations or generates new graphs as global explanations. However, these graph-based methods are limited in their ability to explain classes with multiple sufficient explanations. To provide more expressive explanations, we propose utilizing class expressions (CEs) from the field of description logic (DL). Our approach explains heterogeneous graphs with different types of nodes using CEs in the EL description logic. To identify the best explanation among multiple candidate explanations, we employ and compare two different scoring functions: (1) For a given CE, we construct multiple graphs, have the GNN make a prediction for each graph, and aggregate the predicted scores. (2) We score the CE in terms of fidelity, i.e., we compare the predictions of the GNN to the predictions by the CE on a separate validation set. Instead of subgraph-based explanations, we offer CE-based explanations.</description>

      <title>Commutative codensity monads and probability bimeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several well-studied probability monads have been expressed as codensity monads over small categories of stochastic maps, giving a limit description of spaces of probability measures. In this paper we show how properties of probability monads such as commutativity and affineness can arise from their codensity presentation. First we show that their codensity presentation is closely related to another characterisation of probability monads as terminal endofunctors admitting certain maps into the Giry monad, which allows us to generalise a result by Van Breugel on the Kantorovich monad. We then provide sufficient conditions for a codensity monad to lift to $\bf{MonCat}$, and give a characterisation of exactly pointwise monoidal codensity monads; codensity monads that satisfy a strengthening of these conditions. We show that the Radon monad is exactly pointwise monoidal, and hence give a description of the tensor product of free algebras of the Radon monad in terms of Day convolution. Finally we show that the Giry monad is not exactly pointwise monoidal due to the existence of probability bimeasures that do not extend to measures, although its restriction to standard Borel spaces is. We introduce the notion of a $*$-monad and its Kleisli monoidal op-multicategory to describe the categorical structure that organises the spaces of probability polymeasures on measurable spaces.</description>

      <title>Embedded Finite Models Beyond Restricted Quantifier Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit evaluation of logical formulas that allow both uninterpreted relations, constrained to be finite, as well as an interpreted vocabulary over an infinite domain. This formalism was denoted embedded finite model theory in the past.
  It is clear that the expressiveness and evaluating complexity of formulas of this type depends heavily on the infinite structure. If we embed in a wild structure like the integers with additive and multiplicative arithmetic, logic is extremely expressive and formulas are impossible to evaluate. On the other hand, for some well-known decidable structures, the expressiveness and evaluating complexity are similar to the situation without the additional infrastructure. The latter phenomenon was formalized via the notion of ``Restricted Quantifier Collapse'': adding quantification over the infinite structure does not add expressiveness. Beyond these two extremes little was known.
  In this work we show that the possibilities for expressiveness and complexity are much wider. We show that we can get almost any possible complexity of evaluation while staying within a decidable structure. We also show that in some decidable structures, there is a disconnect between expressiveness of the logic and complexity, in that we cannot eliminate quantification over the structure, but this is not due to an ability to embed complex relational computation in the logic.
  We show failure of collapse for the theory of finite fields and the related theory of pseudo-finite fields, which will involve coding computation in the logic. As a by-product of this, we establish new lower-bounds for the complexity of decision procedures for several decidable theories of fields, including the theory of finite fields.
  In the process of investigating this landscape, we investigate several weakenings of collapse.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we give a linear-size translation from formulas of first-order logic into equations of the calculus of relations preserving validity and finite validity. Our translation also gives a linear-size conservative reduction from formulas of first-order logic into formulas of the three-variable fragment of first-order logic.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Language to Explain Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formal XAI community has studied a plethora of interpretability queries aiming to understand the classifications made by decision trees. However, a more uniform understanding of what questions we can hope to answer about these models, traditionally deemed to be easily interpretable, has remained elusive. In an initial attempt to understand uniform languages for interpretability, Arenas et al. (2021) proposed FOIL, a logic for explaining black-box ML models, and showed that it can express a variety of interpretability queries. However, we show that FOIL is limited in two important senses: (i) it is not expressive enough to capture some crucial queries, and (ii) its model agnostic nature results in a high computational complexity for decision trees. In this paper, we carefully craft two fragments of first-order logic that allow for efficiently interpreting decision trees: Q-DT-FOIL and its optimization variant OPT-DT-FOIL. We show that our proposed logics can express not only a variety of interpretability queries considered by previous literature, but also elegantly allows users to specify different objectives the sought explanations should optimize for. Using finite model-theoretic techniques, we show that the different ingredients of Q-DT-FOIL are necessary for its expressiveness, and yet that queries in Q-DT-FOIL can be evaluated with a polynomial number of queries to a SAT solver, as well as their optimization versions in OPT-DT-FOIL. Besides our theoretical results, we provide a SAT-based implementation of the evaluation for OPT-DT-FOIL that is performant on industry-size decision trees.</description>

      <title>On the Decidability of Monadic Second-Order Logic with Arithmetic Predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the decidability of the monadic second-order (MSO) theory of the structure $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;,P_1, \ldots,P_k \rangle$, for various unary predicates $P_1,\ldots,P_k \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. We focus in particular on "arithmetic" predicates arising in the study of linear recurrence sequences, such as fixed-base powers $\mathsf{Pow}_k = \{k^n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, $k$-th powers $\mathsf{N}_k = \{n^k : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, and the set of terms of the Fibonacci sequence $\mathsf{Fib} = \{0,1,2,3,5,8,13,\ldots\}$ (and similarly for other linear recurrence sequences having a single, non-repeated, dominant characteristic root). We obtain several new unconditional and conditional decidability results, a select sample of which are the following:
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;,\mathsf{Pow}_2, \mathsf{Fib} \rangle$ is decidable;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, \mathsf{Pow}_2, \mathsf{Pow}_3, \mathsf{Pow}_6 \rangle$ is decidable;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, \mathsf{Pow}_2, \mathsf{Pow}_3, \mathsf{Pow}_5 \rangle$ is decidable assuming Schanuel's conjecture;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, \mathsf{Pow}_4, \mathsf{N}_2 \rangle$ is decidable;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, \mathsf{Pow}_2, \mathsf{N}_2 \rangle$ is Turing-equivalent to the MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;,S \rangle$, where $S$ is the predicate corresponding to the binary expansion of $\sqrt{2}$. (As the binary expansion of $\sqrt{2}$ is widely believed to be normal, the corresponding MSO theory is in turn expected to be decidable.)
  These results are obtained by exploiting and combining techniques from dynamical systems, number theory, and automata theory.</description>

      <title>Initial Algebras Unchained -- A Novel Initial Algebra Construction Formalized in Agda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial algebra for an endofunctor F provides a recursion and induction scheme for data structures whose constructors are described by F. The initial-algebra construction by Ad\'amek (1974) starts with the initial object (e.g. the empty set) and successively applies the functor until a fixed point is reached, an idea inspired by Kleene's fixed point theorem. Depending on the functor of interest, this may require transfinitely many steps indexed by ordinal numbers until termination.
  We provide a new initial algebra construction which is not based on an ordinal-indexed chain. Instead, our construction is loosely inspired by Pataraia's fixed point theorem and forms the colimit of all finite recursive coalgebras. This is reminiscent of the construction of the rational fixed point of an endofunctor that forms the colimit of all finite coalgebras. For our main correctness theorem, we assume the given endofunctor is accessible on a (weak form of) locally presentable category. Our proofs are constructive and fully formalized in Agda.</description>

      <title>Learning Explainable and Better Performing Representations of POMDP Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strategies for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) typically require memory. One way to represent this memory is via automata. We present a method to learn an automaton representation of a strategy using a modification of the L*-algorithm. Compared to the tabular representation of a strategy, the resulting automaton is dramatically smaller and thus also more explainable. Moreover, in the learning process, our heuristics may even improve the strategy's performance. In contrast to approaches that synthesize an automaton directly from the POMDP thereby solving it, our approach is incomparably more scalable.</description>

      <title>Monoidal closure of Grothendieck constructions via $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structures and Dialectica formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the categorical structure of the Grothendieck construction of an indexed category $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{C}^{op}\to\mathbf{CAT}$ and characterise fibred limits, colimits, and monoidal structures. Next, we give sufficient conditions for the monoidal closure of the total category $\Sigma_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{L}$ of a Grothendieck construction of an indexed category $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{C}^{op}\to\mathbf{CAT}$. Our analysis is a generalization of G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, and it relies on a novel notion of $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structure. As we will see, $\Sigma$-tractable coproducts simultaneously generalize cocartesian coclosed structures, biproducts and extensive coproducts. We analyse when the closed structure is fibred -- usually it is not.</description>
