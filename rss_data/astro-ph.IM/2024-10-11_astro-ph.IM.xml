      <title>Impact of Exoplanet Science on Society: Professional Contributions, Citizen Science Engagement and Public Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of exoplanet science on both the scientific community and on the general public is presented through various indicators and examples. It is estimated that about 3-4% of all refereed astronomy articles focus on exoplanets, and between 15-20% percent of current, and up to 25% of upcoming astronomy space missions are dedicated to exoplanet research. Also, about 15-20% of the science cases for large multi-purpose ground-based astronomical instruments involve exoplanet science.
  Interactions between the scientific community and the public occur on several levels and play a crucial role in shaping the future of exoplanet science. The rise of citizen science platforms and the successes of coordinated observing projects involving amateur astronomers have engaged the public in meaningful scientific contributions, and contribute to some areas of discovery and characterization of exoplanet systems, for which several examples are given. These initiatives not only fuel public interest in the search for extraterrestrial life but also promote STEM education, broadening participation in science.
  Lastly, the changing perception of the informed public about the existence of "other Earths" and life in the Universe in the light of results from exoplanet science is outlined. Media coverage of results from exoplanet science has furthered the acceptance that extraterrestrial life, be it intelligent of not, is not rare in the Universe. The shift in perception that such life might be detected in a potentially not very distant future has, in turn, promoted public support for the research infrastructure necessary to sustain the growth of exoplanetology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Attitude Control of Large Flexible Space Structures with Distributed Momentum Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent spacecraft mission concepts propose larger payloads that have lighter, less rigid structures. For large lightweight structures, the natural frequencies of their vibration modes may fall within the attitude controller bandwidth, threatening the stability and settling time of the controller and compromising performance. This work tackles this issue by proposing an attitude control design paradigm of distributing momentum actuators throughout the structure to have more control authority over vibration modes. The issue of jitter disturbances introduced by these actuators is addressed by expanding the bandwidth of the attitude controller to suppress excess vibrations. Numerical simulation results show that, at the expense of more control action, a distributed configuration can achieve lower settling times and reduce structural deformation compared to a more standard centralized configuration.</description>

      <title>First Very Long Baseline Interferometry Detections at 870{\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) detections at 870$\mu$m wavelength (345$\,$GHz frequency) are reported, achieving the highest diffraction-limited angular resolution yet obtained from the surface of the Earth, and the highest-frequency example of the VLBI technique to date. These include strong detections for multiple sources observed on inter-continental baselines between telescopes in Chile, Hawaii, and Spain, obtained during observations in October 2018. The longest-baseline detections approach 11$\,$G$\lambda$ corresponding to an angular resolution, or fringe spacing, of 19$\mu$as. The Allan deviation of the visibility phase at 870$\mu$m is comparable to that at 1.3$\,$mm on the relevant integration time scales between 2 and 100$\,$s. The detections confirm that the sensitivity and signal chain stability of stations in the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array are suitable for VLBI observations at 870$\mu$m. Operation at this short wavelength, combined with anticipated enhancements of the EHT, will lead to a unique high angular resolution instrument for black hole studies, capable of resolving the event horizons of supermassive black holes in both space and time.</description>

      <title>PSF Calibration of DAMPE for gamma-ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is dedicated to exploring critical scientific domains including the indirect detection of dark matter, cosmic ray physics, and gamma ray astronomy. This study introduces a novel method for calibrating the Point Spread Function (PSF) of DAMPE, specifically designed to enhance the accuracy of gamma-ray observations. By leveraging data from regions near pulsars and bright Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), we have refined the PSF calibration process, resulting in an improved angular resolution that closely matches our observational data. This advancement significantly boosts the precision of gamma-ray detection by DAMPE, thereby contributing to its mission objectives in dark matter detection and gamma ray astronomy.</description>

      <title>Membrane Space Telescope: Active Surface Control with Radiative Adaptive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensitivity and resolution of space telescopes are directly related to the size of the primary mirror. Enabling such future extremely large space telescopes or even arrays of those will require to drastically reduce the areal weight of the mirror system. Utilizing a thin parabolic polymeric membrane as primary mirror offers the prospect of very low weight and the flexible nature of those membranes allows compactly store them upon launch. Upon deployment the structure is unfolded and the mirror shape restored. Being an extremely thin structure, an active shape correction is required. Utilizing a thermal control of the surface via radiative coupling, localized shape changes are imprinted into the membrane telescope. In this paper we present the modelling and experimental test of the radiative adaptive optics. A detailed modeling of the influence function of the radiative shaping onto the membrane mirror has been carried out. Experimentally we have been radiatively actuated the shape of a prototype mirror in closed loop with a wavefront sensor and proven that we can control the mirrors surface figure to a ~15nm RMS precision.</description>

      <title>Simulating images of radio galaxies with diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing amounts of data in astronomy, automated analysis methods have become crucial. Synthetic data is required for developing and testing such methods. Current simulations often suffer from insufficient detail or inaccurate representation of source type occurrences. To overcome those deficiencies, we implement a deep generative model trained on observations to generate realistic radio galaxy images with control over flux and source morphology. We use a Diffusion Model, trained with continuous time steps to reduce sampling time without quality impairments. Two models are trained on two different datasets, respectively. One is a selection of images from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). The respective model is conditioned on peak flux values to preserve signal intensity information after re-scaling image pixel values. The other is a smaller set with images from the VLA survey of Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST), where every image is provided with a morphological class label that the corresponding model is conditioned on. Conditioned sampling is realized with classifier-free diffusion guidance. We evaluate the quality of generated images by comparing distributions of different quantities over the real and generated data, including results from the standard source-finding algorithms. Class-conditioning is evaluated by training a classifier and comparing its performance on the real and generated data. We are able to generate realistic images of high quality using 25 sampling steps, which is unprecedented in the field of radio astronomy. Generated images are visually indistinguishable from the training data. Distributions of different image metrics are replicated. The classifier performs equally well for real and generated images, indicating accurate sampling control over morphological source properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zadko Observatory located approximately 70 kilometres north of Perth in the Yeal nature reserve within the Shire of Gingin, Western Australia, initially housed the 1.0 metre f/4 fast-slew Zadko Telescope which was commissioned in June 2008. Since the Zadko telescope has been in operation it has proven its worth by detecting numerous Gamma Ray Burst afterglows, two of these being the most distant 'optical transients' imaged by an Australian telescope. The Zadko telescope also contributed to the discovery of colliding neutron stars in 2017 capturing the imagination of the public. Another important use for the Zadko Telescope is the tracking and mapping of Space Debris which consist of all man-made objects, including their fragments or parts, other than active space vehicles larger than 10 microns and orbiting the Earth in outer space. The Zadko telescope forms part of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery (OzGrav). With a view to supporting ongoing scientific instrument upgrades and observatory maintenance it has proven critical to attract additional funding and seek out collaboration with international partners. In this article, we will focus on the administrative and technical details of the Observatory, focusing on the sustainability of the Observatory and its ongoing potential for future growth into an internationally recognized Space Surveillance Hub. We will review the evolution of the Observatory, from its early, single instrument state, to its current multi-telescope and multi-instrument capabilities. We will finish by outlining the future of the Observatory and surrounds.</description>

      <title>The impact of the site quality of the Zadko Observatory on its scientific results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the site quality of the Zadko Observatory, focusing on the brightness of the sky and the effects of the weather on the efficiency of the Observatory. We discuss these effects and their consequences for the scientific goals of the Observatory. Without surprise, the overall sky quality had decreased during the last decade. However, this decrease is mostly due to the weather pattern at the Observatory rather than the light pollution. We put an emphasis on how important the preservation of the sky darkness is for small observatories, in order to stabilize the global degradation of the site quality, as this directly impacts the scientific return of the observations.</description>

      <title>A Multi-station Meteor Monitoring (M$^3$) System. II. system upgrade and a pathfinder network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteors are important phenomenon reflecting many properties of interplanetary dust particles. The study of their origin, mass distribution, and orbit evolution all require large data volume, which can only be obtained using large meteor networks. After meteor networks in Europe and America, we present our designs and upgrades of a proposing network in China. The new designs are mainly aimed for facilitating data gathering process. Each of the newly designed meteor stations now can support up to 4 cameras to cover the full sky. Newer version of meteor station software now works as an integral system, which can streamline the process of detecting, measuring and uploading meteors. We have built a meteor data platform to store, process and display the meteor data automatically. The software and data platform are designed to be easy to learn and use, so it can attract more people to join and operate meteor stations. Four stations are installed as the first phase of the network, and during the operation in 10 months, the network detected 8,683 orbits, and we find that half of the orbits can be related to established meteoroid streams. The statistical analysis of sporadic meteoroids shows a bimodal distribution of the velocities, which coincides with previous studies. The distribution of Tisserand parameters, $T_j$, shows the two peaks at $T_j=0$ and 3, indicating the different orbits of parent bodies (isotropic and ecliptic), which are divided by $T_j=2$. The falling trajectory of a meteorite was also predicted using observational data of the network. We are currently expanding the network, and in the future we will carry out detailed analysis of the key parameters of the distribution of the meteoroids.</description>

      <title>Spectral classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral classification is the division of stars into classes based on their spectral characteristics. Different classification systems have existed since the 19th century but the term is used nowadays mostly to refer to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system, which was established in the 1940s and has been developed since then. The MK classification has three components: a spectral type, a luminosity class, and (possibly) suffixes or qualifiers. The first two components represent temperature and luminosity sequences (a 2-D grid), respectively, and the third one includes additional information. The MK system is an Aristotelian morphological classification system that uses the MK process, an inductive approach based on specimens (standard stars) that define the system. In that respect, it is different from and a required preliminary step for quantitative spectroscopy, whose goal is to extract the physical properties and chemical composition of the stars. In this entry we provide a brief history of spectral classification, describe the general properties of the classification criteria of the MK system, analyze the specific spectral type and luminosity class criteria used for each spectral class, and introduce the different peculiar types that can be found within the 2-D classification grid and at its edges.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) consists of an incoherent collection of waves from both astrophysical and cosmological sources. To distinguish the SGWB from noise, it is essential to verify its quadrupolar nature, exemplified by the cross-correlations among pairs of pulsars within a pulsar timing array, commonly referred to as the Hellings-Downs curve. We extend the concept of quadrupolar correlations to pairs of general gravitational wave detectors, classified by their antenna responses. This study involves space-based missions such as the laser interferometers LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, along with atom interferometers like AEDGE/MAGIS. We calculate modulations in their correlations due to orbital motions and relative orientations, which are characteristic markers for identifying the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB. Our findings identify optimal configurations for these missions, offer forecasts for the time needed to identify the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB, and are applicable to both space-space and space-terrestrial correlations.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented vessel detection with distributed computing in a LEO satellite constellation</title>

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) has traditionally involved the transmission of a large volume of raw data to map the Earth surface. This results in congestion to the satellite network and delays in the availability of the results, invalidating the approach for timing-sensitive applications. Instead, the computation resources at the satellites can be used as an edge layer for compressing the data and/or doing inferences. In this paper, we investigate satellite edge computing for vessel detection with a LEO satellite constellation. First, we distribute the computation and inference load among the neighbouring satellites of the one taking the images, based on the VHRShips data set and YOLOv8. This semantic and fragmented information is then routed to a remote ground monitor through the whole constellation. The average and peak Age of Information (AoI) are reformulated to measure the freshness of the aggregated information at the receiver in this image-capture scenario. We then dimension the network (number of orbital planes and satellites per orbital plane) for a given target age and covered area that quantify the level of achievement of the task. The results show that 20 orbital planes with 20 satellites are necessary to keep the peak AoI below 60 seconds with a compression ratio &gt; 23000, i.e., a size reduction of 99.996%, and for a approximately 100% probability of coverage.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{21cmLSTM}$: A Fast Memory-based Emulator of the Global 21 cm Signal with Unprecedented Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network (NN) emulators of the global 21 cm signal need emulation error much less than the observational noise in order to be used to perform unbiased Bayesian parameter inference. To this end, we introduce $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ -- a long short-term memory (LSTM) NN emulator of the global 21 cm signal that leverages the intrinsic correlation between frequency channels to achieve exceptional accuracy compared to previous emulators, which are all feedforward, fully connected NNs. LSTM NNs are a type of recurrent NN designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. When trained and tested on the same simulated set of global 21 cm signals as the best previous emulators, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ has average relative rms error of 0.22% -- equivalently 0.39 mK -- and comparably fast evaluation time. We perform seven-dimensional Bayesian parameter estimation analyses using $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ to fit global 21 cm signal mock data with different adopted observational noise levels, $\sigma_{21}$. The posterior $1\sigma$ rms error is $\approx3\times$ less than $\sigma_{21}$ for each fit and consistently decreases for tighter noise levels, showing that $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ can sufficiently exploit even very optimistic measurements of the global 21 cm signal. We made the emulator, code, and data sets publicly available so that $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ can be independently tested and used to retrain and constrain other 21 cm models.</description>

      <title>The radial distribution of radio emission from SN1993J: Magnetic field amplification due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [SHORTENED VERSION] Observations of radio emission from young core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) allow one to study the history of the pre-supernova stellar wind, trace the density structure of the ejected material, and probe the magnetohydrodynamics that describe the interaction between the two, as the forward shock expands into the circumstellar medium. The radio shell of supernova SN1993J has been observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) for ~20 years, giving one of the most complete pictures of the evolution of a CCSN shock. However, different results about the expansion curve and properties of the radio-emitting structure have been reported by different authors, likely due to systematics in the data calibration and/or model assumptions made by each team. We aim to perform an analysis of the complete set of VLBI observations of SN1993J that accounts for different instrumental and source-intrinsic effects, by exploring the posterior probability distribution of a complete data model, using Markov chains. Our model accounts for antenna calibration effects, as well as different kinds of radio-emission structures for the supernova. The posterior parameter distributions strongly favor a spherical shell-like radio structure with a nonuniform radial intensity profile, with a broad brightness distribution that peaks close to or just above the region where the contact discontinuity is expected to be located. There is clear evidence of a relative widening of the shell width beyond day 2600-3300 after the explosion, due to an increased deceleration of the inner shell boundary. These results suggest a scenario in which the magnetic field is amplified mainly by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which emanates from the contact discontinuity. Furthermore, the reverse shock enters a region of the ejecta at around 3000 days, where the density distribution is substantially flatter.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Deep Learning Models to Precession in Gravitational-Wave Searches for Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave searches for signals of intermediate-mass black hole binaries are hindered by detector glitches, as the increased masses from stellar-mass systems hinder current generation detectors from observing the inspiral phase of the binary evolution. This causes the waveforms to strongly resemble glitches, which are of similar duration within a similar frequency band. Additionally, precession of the orbital plane of a binary black hole may further warp signal waveforms. In this work three neural network-based classifiers for the task of distinguishing between signals and glitches are introduced, with each following different training regimes to study the impact of precession on the classifiers. Although all classifiers show highly accurate performance, the classifier found to perform best was trained following the principle of curriculum learning, where new examples are introduced only after the mastery of easier preceding examples. This classifier obtains an accuracy of approximately 95% on a synthetic test set consisting of signals and glitches injected into coloured noise from the O3 LIGO Hanford power spectral density. The model is compared to matched filtering, the state-of-the-art in modelled gravitational-wave searches, and analysed in search of particular sensitivities to black hole binary parameters. It was found that while the classifier is affected by the total mass of a system, the prediction of a misclassification is most strongly determined by visibility through the signal-to-noise ratio. The analysis of the three classifiers demonstrates that precession is handled differently depending on the training regime, meaning the architecture is not fully robust to precession and advancements can be made through the development of training routines.</description>

      <title>A Laboratory Method for Measuring the Cross-Polarization in High-Contrast Imaging</title>

Abstract: Existing Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) methods are not suited for treating small polarization effects, referred to here as cross polarization. EFC utilizes a deformable mirror (DM) to nullify the electric fields from the host star within a \emph{dark hole} region in the image plane, allowing the detection of planets.
  This article presents realistic numerical simulations of a laboratory method for measuring the cross-polarization electric field in a stellar coronagraph. This novel method uses linear polarizers to isolate the cross polarization component and probing procedures similar to those in existing EFC methods to measure the electric field corresponding to cross polarization. The proposed nonlinear probing scheme is specifically designed to address polarizer leakage. The method is not a generalization of existing EFC procedures in order to null the cross polarization field; rather, it is a non-iterative laboratory calibration procedure with applications in instrument characterization and validation of numerical models. However, lab-validated numerical models of the cross-polarization are directly applicable to on-sky observations.
  The proposed experimental method is not significantly more demanding than existing testbed procedures, requiring little additional equipment. Yet, the simulation results demonstrate highly accurate estimates of the electric field corresponding to the cross polarization in a dark hole. These encouraging results suggest that laboratory implementation is viable. Simulations are performed for a randomly aberrated Lyot coronagraph with a dark hole size of $\sim 4 \lambda/D \times 4 \lambda/D$ in the image plane with a contrast of $\sim 10^{-10}$ in contrast (i.e., the planet-to-star intensity ratio) units. The cross-polarization electric fields accurately estimated by the method correspond to intensities of $\sim 10^{-11}$ in contrast units.</description>

      <title>Fast Waveform Generation for Gravitational Waves using Evolutionary Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave analyses depend heavily on waveforms that model the evolution of compact binary coalescences as seen by observing detectors. In many cases these waveforms are given by waveform approximants, models that approximate the amplitude and phase of the waveform at a set of frequencies. Because of their omnipresence, improving the speed at which approximants can generate waveforms is crucial to accelerating the overall analysis of gravitational-wave detections. An optimisation algorithm is proposed that can select at which frequencies in the spectrum an approximant should compute the power of a waveform, and at which frequencies the power can be safely interpolated at a minor loss in accuracy. The algorithm used is an evolutionary algorithm modeled after the principle of natural selection, iterating frequency arrays that perform better at every iteration. As an application, the candidates proposed by the algorithm are used to reconstruct signal-to-noise ratios. It is shown that the IMRPhenomXPHM approximant can be sped up by at least 30% at a loss of at most 2.87% on the drawn samples, measured by the accuracy of the reconstruction of signal-to-noise ratios. The behaviour of the algorithm as well as lower bounds on both speedup and error are explored, leading to a proposed proof of concept candidate that obtains a speedup of 46% with a maximum error of 0.5% on a sample of the parameter space used.</description>

      <title>Debiasing astro-Photometric Observations with Corrections Using Statistics (DePhOCUS)</title>

Abstract: Photometric measurements allow the determination of an asteroid's absolute magnitude, which often represents the sole means to infer its size. Photometric observations can be obtained in a variety of filters that can be unique to a specific observatory. Those observations are then calibrated into specific bands with respect to reference star catalogs. In order to combine all the different measurements for evaluation, photometric observations need to be converted to a common band, typically V-band. Current band-correction schemes in use by IAU's Minor Planet Center, JPL's Center for Near Earth Object Studies and ESA's NEO Coordination Centre use average correction values for the apparent magnitude derived from photometry of asteroids as the corrections are dependent on the typically unknown spectrum of the object to be corrected. By statistically analyzing the photometric residuals of asteroids, we develop a new photometric correction scheme that does not only consider the band, but also accounts for reference catalog and observatory. We describe a new statistical photometry correction scheme for asteroid observations with debiased corrections. Testing this scheme on a reference group of asteroids, we see a 36% reduction in the photometric residuals. Moreover, the new scheme leads to a more accurate and debiased determination of the H-G magnitude system and, in turn, to more reliable inferred sizes. We discuss the significant shift in the corrections with this "DePhOCUS" debiasing system, its limitations, and the impact for photometric and physical properties of all asteroids, especially Near-Earth Objects.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of X-point collapse in an extended magnetohydrodynamics framework</title>

Abstract: The study of X-point collapse in magnetic reconnection has witnessed extensive research in the context of space and laboratory plasmas. In this paper, a recently derived mathematical formulation of X-point collapse applicable in the regime of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) is shown to possess a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure composed of five dynamical variables inherited from its parent model. The Hamiltonian and the noncanonical Poisson bracket are both derived, and the latter is shown to obey the requisite properties of antisymmetry and the Jacobi identity (an explicit proof of the latter is provided). In addition, the governing equations for the Casimir invariants are presented, and one such solution is furnished. The above features can be harnessed and expanded in future work, such as developing structure-preserving integrators for this dynamical system.</description>

      <title>DeepClean: Non-Linear Regression for Noise Reduction in the Virgo Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves (GW) in 2015, there have been significant efforts to enhance the sensitivity of the ground-based detectors within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Despite these efforts, many gravitational wave signals remain below the detection threshold due to non-linear noise from the physical environment of the detectors, coupled with the main GW signal.
  \texttt{DeepClean}'s capability to handle a variety of noise sources, including linear, non-linear, and \emph{non-stationary} coupling mechanisms, is particularly important in fields like astrophysics and gravitational wave astronomy, where accurate data analysis is crucial for the detection and study of gravitational waves from astronomical events.</description>
