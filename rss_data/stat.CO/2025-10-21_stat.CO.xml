      <title>Principled Argo Modeling using Vecchia-based Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argo is an international program that collects temperature and salinity observations in the upper two kilometers of the global ocean. Most existing approaches for modeling Argo temperature rely on spatial partitioning, where data are locally modeled by first estimating a prescribed mean structure and then fitting Gaussian processes (GPs) to the mean-subtracted anomalies. Such strategies introduce challenges in designing suitable mean structures and defining domain partitions, often resulting in ad hoc modeling choices. In this work, we propose a one-stop Gaussian process regression framework with a generic spatio-temporal covariance function to jointly model Argo temperature data across broad spatial domains. Our fully data-driven approach achieves superior predictive performance compared with methods that require domain partitioning or parametric regression. To ensure scalability over large spatial regions, we employ the Vecchia approximation, which reduces the computational complexity from cubic to quasi-linear in the number of observations while preserving predictive accuracy. Using Argo data from January to March over the years 2007-2016, the same dataset used in prior benchmark studies, we demonstrate that our approach provides a principled, scalable, and interpretable tool for large-scale oceanographic analysis.</description>

      <title>A Frequentist Statistical Introduction to Variational Inference, Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its pedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is typically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine learning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint, where VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a barrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to contextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This paper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs from a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable solution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural, deep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap between classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian inference for time series via divide-and-conquer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11043v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian computational algorithms tend to scale poorly as data size increases. This has motivated divide-and-conquer-based approaches for scalable inference. These divide the data into subsets, perform inference for each subset in parallel, and then combine these inferences. While appealing theoretical properties and practical performance have been demonstrated for independent observations, scalable inference for dependent data remains challenging. In this work, we study the problem of Bayesian inference from very long time series. The literature in this area focuses mainly on approximate approaches that usually lack rigorous theoretical guarantees and may provide arbitrarily poor accuracy in practice. We propose a simple and scalable divide-and-conquer method, and provide accuracy guarantees. Numerical simulations and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Nearly Dimension-Independent Convergence of Mean-Field Black-Box Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a mean-field location-scale variational family, black-box variational inference (BBVI) with the reparametrization gradient converges at a rate that is nearly independent of explicit dimension dependence. Specifically, for a $d$-dimensional strongly log-concave and log-smooth target, the number of iterations for BBVI with a sub-Gaussian family to obtain a solution $\epsilon$-close to the global optimum has a dimension dependence of $\mathrm{O}(\log d)$. This is a significant improvement over the $\mathrm{O}(d)$ dependence of full-rank location-scale families. For heavy-tailed families, we prove a weaker $\mathrm{O}(d^{2/k})$ dependence, where $k$ is the number of finite moments of the family. Additionally, if the Hessian of the target log-density is constant, the complexity is free of any explicit dimension dependence. We also prove that our bound on the gradient variance, which is key to our result, cannot be improved using only spectral bounds on the Hessian of the target log-density.</description>

      <title>Penalised spline estimation of covariate-specific time-dependent ROC curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of biomarkers with high predictive accuracy is a crucial task in medical research, as it can aid clinicians in making early decisions, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are the main tool used to assess the accuracy of prognostic biomarkers for outcomes that evolve over time. Recognising the need to account for patient heterogeneity when evaluating the accuracy of a prognostic biomarker, we introduce a novel penalised-based estimator of the time-dependent ROC curve that accommodates a possible modifying effect of covariates. We consider flexible models for both the hazard function of the event time given the covariates and biomarker and for the location-scale regression model of the biomarker given covariates, enabling the accommodation of non-proportional hazards and nonlinear effects through penalised splines, thus overcoming limitations of earlier methods. The simulation study demonstrates that our approach successfully recovers the true functional form of the covariate-specific time-dependent ROC curve and the corresponding area under the curve across a variety of scenarios. Comparisons with existing methods further show that our approach performs favourably in multiple settings. Our approach is applied to evaluate the ability of the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score to predict mortality over different time periods after discharge in patients who have suffered an acute coronary syndrome and to investigate how this ability may vary with the left ventricular ejection fraction. An R package, CondTimeROC, implementing the proposed method is provided.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path Planning in Correlated Obstacle Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Correlated Obstacle Scene (SCOS) problem, a navigation setting with spatially correlated obstacles of uncertain blockage status, realistically constrained sensors that provide noisy readings and costly disambiguation. Modeling the spatial correlation with Gaussian Random Field (GRF), we develop Bayesian belief updates that refine blockage probabilities, and use the posteriors to reduce search space for efficiency. To find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating and convergence property under posterior sampling. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across varying obstacle densities, sensor capabilities demonstrate consistent performance gains over baselines. This framework addresses navigation challenges in environments with adversarial interruptions or clustered natural hazards.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Bayesian Solution of the Empirical Stochastic Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic inverse problem is a key ingredient in making inferences, predictions, and decisions for complex science and engineering systems. We formulate and analyze a nonparametric Bayesian solution for the stochastic inverse problem. Key properties of the solution are proved and the convergence and error of a computational solution obtained by random sampling is analyzed. Several applications illustrate the results.</description>
