      <title>Mixed Freeze-In and Freeze-Out Histories and Dark-Sector Decays in a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Two-Scalar Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic non-equilibrium analysis of a renormalisable $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Higgs-portal dark sector comprising a complex scalar $S_A$ and a real scalar $S_B$. In this framework, conversion, semi-annihilation, and (when kinematically allowed) $S_B\to S_A S_A$ decays shape the coupled relic-density evolution. Imposing theoretical consistency, Higgs invisible-decay limits, and the latest LZ spin-independent bound with the standard relic-fraction rescaling, we show that the severe exclusions typical of thermal two-WIMP analyses are largely an artefact of requiring both components to thermalise with the SM bath. Mixed WIMP-FIMP (and fully feeble FIMP-FIMP) histories reopen regions excluded in thermal two-WIMP interpretations, since the total relic density can be shared while the direct-detection signal is carried only by the thermal fraction. For the unstable hierarchy $M_{S_B}&gt;2M_{S_A}$, we identify decay-dominated regimes-SuperWIMP, injection-assisted freeze-out, and sequential freeze-in (``SuperFIMP'')-where late dark-sector injection sets the final $S_A$ abundance. These results establish the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Higgs-portal model as a controlled benchmark for multi-component dark matter beyond the two-thermal-relic assumption.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Long-Lived Particles Using Dimension-Six Effective Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lived particles (LLPs) provide an interesting window into physics beyond the Standard Model, offering characteristic signatures at colliders and in cosmology. In this work, we investigate LLPs decays into dark matter. If the lifetime of LLPs are longer than $10^4$s, the decay products can disrupt the synthesis of light nuclei in the early universe and alter Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) predictions. If the LLP is much heavier than the dark matter particle, the decay contributes to the number of effective neutrino species, $N_{eff}$. We describe these decays via dimension-six effective operators and outline the parameter space in which such decays obey cosmological bounds stemming from BBN, structure formation, Cosmic Microwave Background, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data.</description>

      <title>Scaling solutions for varying tension strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Velocity-dependent One Scale Model for topological defect evolution to explore and classify the possible scaling solutions for string networks with time-varying tension, in cosmological and non-cosmological settings and under two different phenomenological assumptions for the behavior of these variations, which rely on different stretching and damping contributions to the string dynamics. We discuss how these assumptions impact the standard scaling solutions, as well as the evolution of the string network density. In addition to simple power-law cosmological epochs solutions, we also discuss the behavior of the network during the radiation-to-matter and matter-to-acceleration transitions. Overall, our results show that for the same amount of tension variation, a change in the stretching length scale tends to have a more significant impact on the network than a change in the damping length.</description>

      <title>Dark Glueball Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider glueball dark matter (DM) in a Yang-Mills dark sector confined at $\Lambda_D$ scale and coupled to the Standard Model through electrically and dark-color charged vector-like fermion portals, with the mass scale $m_\psi$. In a simple case with two lightest mass-degenerate vector-like fermions with opposite electric charges the effective amplitudes with one $C$-odd glueball (oddball) and odd number of photons vanish, rendering the lightest $C$-odd spin-1 state with mass $m_\chi$ a viable DM candidate provided that $m_\psi\gtrsim 5.5 \Lambda_D$. We develop a controlled effective field theory framework with non-perturbative information supported by QCD phenomenology leading to a quantitative prediction for coherent elastic glueball scattering off nuclei. We find a steep scaling of the spin-independent cross section $\sigma_{\rm SI}\propto \Lambda_D^{2.15} m_\psi^{-8}$. This implies that the sensitivity of the current and next-generation xenon experiments in the range of $\sigma_{\rm SI} \sim 10^{-46} - 10^{-48}$ cm$^2$ corresponds to $m_\psi \simeq 3-30$ GeV, respectively, for $\Lambda_D\simeq 0.55-5.5$ GeV. We provide a minimal UV completion of the portal sector compatible with collider phenomenology. Our results pave a quantitative foundation for testing glueball DM in direct-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>A limit on top quark pair production at future electron-proton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ratio of the structure functions for deep inelastic scattering in top pair production at future electron-proton colliders is analyzed at a fixed $\sqrt{s}$ and $Q^2$ relative to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$ using collinear factorization. This compact formula for the ratio $F_{L2}(Q^2/s,Q^2,m_{t})$ is useful for extracting a bound on the top structure function. The reduced cross-section for top production at this limit is determined, establishing a bound value for $t\overline{t}$ production at the LHeC and FCC-eh center-of-mass energies based on renormalization scales. The modification of the Bjorken scaling is applied to this bound of the reduced top cross-section at the renormalization scale $\mu^2=Q^2+4m_{t}^{2}$, which improves the scaling quantity at $Q^2{&lt;}4m_{t}^{2}$. The dipole cross-section for top pair production is examined across a wide range of dipole sizes, denoted as $r$. It is expected that there will be limited behavior in observing top saturation in future electron-proton colliders according to the bound behavior. The probability of the Higgs boson in $\gamma^{*}g$ interactions is compared to the $gg$ process at the order of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{\mathrm{em}}/\alpha_{s})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristics of neutrino absorption by $^{82}$Se nucleus reaction -- low threshold value, high absorption cross section of neutrinos, emitted by artificial sources, make selenium-82 perspective object to search for new neutrino species in calibration experiments. One of the interesting possibilities is usage of scintillating crystals. In (3+1) model for spherical geometry the expression for neutrino path length in a setup in the presence of oscillations is obtained and the scheme of experiment is proposed.</description>

      <title>Two nearby states in the $X(3872)$ region: Resolving the radiative-decay ratio tension with $\eta_{c2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, LHCb reported the radiative-decay ratio ${\cal R}^{\psi\gamma}\equiv {\cal B}[X(3872)\to \psi'\gamma]/{\cal B}[X(3872)\to J/\psi\gamma]=1.67\pm 0.25$ extracted from $B^+\to K^+(J/\psi\gamma, \psi'\gamma)$. This result differs markedly ($\sim4.6\sigma$) from the BESIII value obtained from $e^+e^-\to \gamma(J/\psi\gamma, \psi'\gamma)$, ${\cal R}^{\psi\gamma}=-0.04\pm 0.28$. Such a significant tension suggests that more than one state in the $X(3872)$ region contributes to the processes. We therefore propose a two-state scenario: a shallow $D^{*0}\bar{D}^0$ bound state with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ and a $2^{-+}$ charmonium candidate, $\eta_{c2}$, slightly above the $D^{*0}\bar{D}^0$ threshold. We show that this hypothesis consistently describes these ratios along with other branching fractions and lineshapes across multiple processes. By contrast, fits without the $\eta_{c2}$ component fail to reproduce the radiative-ratio data. We also predict helicity-angle distributions that motivates the future experiments to test the two-state hypothesis and search for the so-far missing $\eta_{c2}$.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of gravitational form factors using generative machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generative framework based on denoising diffusion for the model-independent reconstruction of hadronic form factors from sparse and noisy data. The generative prior is built from a large ensemble of synthetic curves drawn from ten distinct functional classes rooted in different theoretical approaches to hadron structure. Applied to the proton gravitational form factors $A(t)$, $J(t)$, and $D(t)$, the framework yields non-parametric reconstructions consistent with lattice QCD across the full kinematic range $0\le -t\le 2~\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$, remaining robust even when only one or two conditioning points are retained. The densely sampled output enables a direct extraction of the chiral low-energy constants $c_8=-4.6\pm 0.8$ and $c_9=-0.61\pm 0.19$. Using these values at the physical pion mass, we obtain $D(0)=-4.3\pm 0.8$ for the nucleon $D$-term.</description>

      <title>Kaon decay constraints on vector bosons coupled to non-conserved currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rare three- and four-body kaon decays as a probe of light vector and axial-vector bosons coupled to non-conserved currents. We find that searches for $K_L \to \pi^0 \pi^0 (X\to e^+e^-)$ decays constrain the couplings of light $X$ bosons to light quarks to be as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. The charged-pion modes $K^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0 (X \to e^+e^-)$ and $K_L \to \pi^+ \pi^- (X \to e^+e^-)$ provide weaker limits, but constrain complementary combinations of couplings to the $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$. Finally, we also find that double emission of $X$ in $K \to \pi XX$ decays can provide yet additional constraints on the parameter space of light $X$ bosons due to a double $(m_K/m_X)^2$ enhancement to the rate. For a 17 MeV boson, these limits add to the known tension between spin-1 bosons coupled to vector and axial-vector currents interpretations of the results of the ATOMKI experiment with meson decay data. Finally, we also comment on negative pion capture on hydrogen and deuterium as a source of light particles and discuss the prospects for testing the 17 MeV boson hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Form factors of $\Delta$(1232) and the electromagnetic $N-\Delta$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of $\Delta$ isobars, as well as the electromagnetic $N-\Delta$ transition form factors are studied systematically and continuously using a covariant quark-diquark approach with the pion cloud effect. In our model, the baryon is treated as the two-body system to simplify calculations, and the quarks are assumed to be surrounded by the pion cloud. The related physical properties, such as the charge radius and magnetic moment of $\Delta$ and the helicity amplitudes of the $N-\Delta$ transition are obtained and discussed. Our results for the form factors of both $\Delta$(1232) and the electromagnetic $N-\Delta$ transition are in reasonable agreement with the experimental or lattice results. Moreover, we found that the pion cloud plays an important role in the results through enlarging the magnetic transition form factor $G_M(t)$ and shifting the sign of the D-term of $\Delta$ to negative.</description>

      <title>Three-body molecular states composed of $D^{(*)}$ and two nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-body systems $DNN$ and $D^{*}NN$ within a hadronic molecular framework by combining a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction with a $D^{(*)}N$ potential constrained by heavy-quark symmetry. The three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved with the Gaussian Expansion Method, and the analytic structure of the spectrum is investigated using the Complex Scaling Method. We find that the $DNN$ system supports a robust and compact bound state in the $I(J^{P})=\tfrac{1}{2}(1^-)$ channel over a broad range of cutoff values, even when the corresponding $DN$ subsystem is weakly bound or unbound. For $D^{*}NN$, the spin-$1$ nature of the heavy meson and the associated spin-dependent forces generate a clear spin hierarchy: deeply bound states appear in both $0^-$ and $2^-$ channels, while the $1^-$ channel exhibits a characteristic two-branch pattern with a strongly bound compact branch and a more weakly bound, spatially extended branch. The root-mean-square radii indicate pronounced spatial compression compared with the deuteron scale, highlighting the cooperative roles of realistic $NN$ correlations, the $D^{(*)}N$ interactions, and heavy-quark symmetry in forming compact heavy-flavor few-body bound states. No three-body resonances under complex scaling are found in the explored parameter space. Our results provide quantitative benchmarks for future experimental searches for such charmed-meson-nuclear bound states.</description>

      <title>Relative transverse activity as an event classifier to investigate collectivity-like phenomena in proton$-$proton collisions at the LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-particle number ($R_{2}$) and transverse-momentum ($P_{2}$) correlation functions are studied in proton$-$proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV simulated with PYTHIA 8, in the low-transverse-momentum region where soft QCD processes dominate the particle production. Events are classified using the relative transverse activity observable $R_{\mathrm{T}}$, which provides a differential characterization of predominantly soft underlying-event (UE) activity. A finite long-range near-side component emerges in the charge-independent correlator $R_{2}^{\mathrm{CI}}$ for UE-dominated events ($2.5 &lt; R_{\mathrm{T}} \leq 5.0$), whereas no corresponding long-range structure is observed in the charge-dependent correlators. This behavior suggests that the ridge-like feature is primarily driven by charge-independent QCD dynamics rather than short-range charge-balancing effects. In contrast, the transverse-momentum correlator $P_{2}^{\mathrm{CI}}$ remains dominated by localized, jet-like structures across all $R_{\mathrm{T}}$ intervals. The near-side correlation peak exhibits a systematic narrowing in $\Delta\varphi$ for the charge-independent case with increasing $R_{\mathrm{T}}$, while the charge-dependent correlators remain localized in both $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\varphi$ and show only mild broadening. These results indicate that enhanced UE activity can give rise to collectivity-like long-range correlation structures within a non-hydrodynamic framework and provide a PYTHIA baseline for interpreting small-system measurements at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Directional recoil detection for CEvNS measurements with light nuclei at the Spallation Neutron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos on nuclei, also known as CEvNS, has been studied for several years by the COHERENT program of experiments using neutrinos from stopped-pion decays produced at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). We propose a new approach for CEvNS measurements at the SNS that aims to complement the COHERENT experiments in two main ways: by reconstructing the angular distribution of CEvNS-induced recoils, and by measuring CEvNS on much lighter target nuclei such as helium, carbon, and fluorine. The proposed detector would employ a gaseous time-projection chamber with a highly segmented charge readout to enable the spatial reconstruction of $\sim$10-500 keV ionisation tracks created by CEvNS-induced recoils. This would enable the simultaneous measurement of the CEvNS recoil energy and scattering angle, thereby allowing event-by-event reconstruction of the neutrino energy. We estimate that a 60:40 He:CF$_4$ gas mixture at atmospheric pressure offers a good trade-off between total target mass and good directionality and could deliver a detection of the angular distribution of CEvNS, even under pessimistic background conditions. We project the sensitivity of 1 and 10 m$^3$-scale detectors in the context of several physics cases, including: the measurement of the Standard Model CEvNS cross section, reconstruction of the flavour-dependent neutrino fluxes, observing the neutrino-induced Migdal effect, constraints on beyond-Standard Model neutrino interactions, and probing 10-eV-scale sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>2025 EIC-France Workshop: Physics Highlights and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a synthesis of the theory contributions and discussions from the 2nd EIC-France Workshop, held at IJCLab (Orsay) on 1-3 December 2025. The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.
  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.
  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent treatment of repulsive corrections in HRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate the treatment of density-dependent chemical potential shifts appearing in excluded-volume implementations of the hadron resonance gas model. An auxiliary classical representation is constructed in which a common energy shift is determined by preserving the scalar number density, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Hadron radii are parametrized through a liquid-drop inspired mass-radius relation with two parameters: the pion radius and a scaling exponent. The resulting framework reproduces lattice QCD results for lower-order conserved-charge susceptibilities at zero chemical potentials with only two adjustable parameters.</description>

      <title>MoCaNLO: a Monte Carlo integrator for NLO calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Monte Carlo integration code MoCaNLO, which computes cross sections and distributions for processes at high-energy colliders like the LHC at leading and next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong and electroweak couplings. It relies on the Recola package for the calculation of matrix elements and uses Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction for the treatment of infrared singularities. It has been used for several cutting-edge calculations of NLO QCD and electroweak corrections over the last years, such as NLO QCD corrections to off-shell top-antitop-quark production in association with a pair of bottom quarks and NLO electroweak corrections to vector-boson scattering processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Chapter introduces QCD at finite temperature and density. We first present the formulation of the thermal theory in the Euclidean path integral formalism. We then describe how the strong dynamics at high temperature can be inspected through thermal effective field theories. As a concrete example of thermodynamic quantity, we discuss the Equation of State, which characterises the equilibrium properties of the QCD plasma. We finally conclude with an overview of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <title>Probing Doubly Charged Higgs Bosons with Three-Body Associated Production at Future $e^+e^-$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discovery prospects for a doubly charged Higgs boson $H^{\pm\pm}$ in the 2-Higgs Doublet Model with type-II seesaw (2HDMcT) at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. Focusing on the three-body channels $e^+e^- \to H^{\pm\pm}H_1^{\mp}H_1^{\mp}$ and $e^+e^- \to H^{\pm\pm}H_1^{\mp}W^{\mp}$, we scan the model parameter space subject to theoretical consistency as well as current collider, flavor and Electro-Weak Precision Observables (EWPOs). We find that these $2\to3$ production modes can exceed the conventional pair-production rate $e^+e^- \to H^{++}H^{--}$, followed by $H^{\pm\pm}\to H_1^{\pm}H_1^{\pm}$ and $H^{\pm}_1W^{\pm}$ decays, over wide regions, particularly above the $H^{\pm\pm}\to H_1^{\pm}H_1^{\pm}$ and $H^{\pm\pm}\to H_1^{\pm}W^{\pm}$ thresholds, reaching cross-sections up to ${\cal O}(10^2)$~fb for $\sqrt{s}=500$--$1500$~GeV. A detector-level analysis of the $4\ell + E_T^{\text{miss}}$ signature, including dominant multiboson and top quark backgrounds, shows that discovery sensitivity is achievable for $\sqrt{s}=1000$-$1500$~GeV with integrated luminosities in the few ab$^{-1}$ range, even in the presence of realistic systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Unquenched Charmonium and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The year 2024 marked the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the $J/\psi$ particle, which unveiled the charm quark and the charmonium spectrum, instigating the "November Revolution" in particle physics. This discovery catalyzed the development of quenched potential models, most notably the Cornell model, which provided a foundational quantitative description of the hadronic spectrum. However, the landscape of hadron spectroscopy has been profoundly transformed since the turn of the 21st century with the observation of numerous charmonium-like states, such as $X(3872)$, which exhibit properties starkly at odds with quenched model predictions. These discrepancies, exemplified by the "$X(3872)$ low-mass puzzle" and the "$Y$ problem" associated with vector states like $Y(4260)$, underscore the critical limitations of the quenched approximation and signal the necessity for a new theoretical paradigm. This review synthesizes recent advances in hadronic spectroscopy, arguing that the unquenched picture, which incorporates coupled-channel effects such as hadronic loops, is essential for a unified description of these new states and associated anomalies. We demonstrate how unquenched effects provide compelling solutions to long-standing puzzles in charmonium decays (e.g., the "$\rho\pi$ puzzle" and anomalous dipion transitions), predict and explain the existence of exotic charged states like $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_b(10610)$ via mechanisms such as Initial Single Pion Emission, and offer a framework for understanding interactions between charmonia and with nucleons. Furthermore, we emphasize the universality of unquenched effects, extending their application to bottomonium and light-flavor sectors. With improving precision, we advocate systematic development of unquenched hadronic spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Invariant Longitudinal Modes in the Herwig 7 Electroweak Parton Shower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal electroweak gauge bosons are the most technically delicate ingredient of electroweak parton showers: in the broken Standard Model, the gauge component of a longitudinal polarisation does not cancel diagram by diagram, but is related by Ward identities to amplitudes with an insertion of the associated would-be Goldstone field. Building on the default Herwig 7 treatment based on the Dawson-subtracted longitudinal current, we construct a gauge-invariant longitudinal scheme in which the Dawson remainder is retained as a well-defined contribution and completed by a Ward-identity-fixed Goldstone-matching term. We derive helicity-resolved building blocks and compact quasi-collinear splitting kernels for $q\to q'V$ and $V\to V'V''$ branchings, and implement the scheme in Herwig 7 as a switchable alternative to the default longitudinal basis. The completion leaves the transverse sector unchanged and modifies only longitudinal entries through controlled symmetry-breaking terms, including Yukawa-sensitive contributions in massive-fermion channels. In shower-level studies, we find that the Dawson and gauge-invariant prescriptions coincide at high evolution scales, while differing at lower scales precisely in channels where symmetry breaking is active. Exclusive single-emission observables can moreover display non-monotonic scheme dependence once Sudakov suppression and kinematic constraints are accounted for. A first multi-emission LHC-like study confirms numerical stability and yields controlled, interpretable shifts in observables that probe propagating electroweak shower currents, whereas quantities dominated by promptly contracted, near on-shell vector-boson matrix elements remain largely unchanged.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic scalar dark matter in U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$: Evading direct detection and prospective neutron star heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptophilic dark matter (DM) is a well-motivated thermal WIMP framework that can evade stringent nuclear-recoil searches while remaining testable via DM-induced heating of neutron stars (NS). In this work, we study leptophilic scalar DM in a $\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, which provides a common leptophilic portal for all scenarios considered. To reproduce the observed relic abundance while suppressing direct-detection signals, we investigate three benchmark realizations: (i) a secluded DM scenario in which the relic density is set by annihilation into $\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge bosons, and two pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) DM models based on (ii) an SO(4) symmetry and (iii) an SO(3) symmetry. In the SO(4) pNGB model, the DM mass arises at tree level from a soft breaking term, while the elastic scattering amplitude is suppressed by a symmetry-protected cancellation. In the SO(3) pNGB model, the DM mass is generated radiatively at one loop via the $\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge interaction, and we show that this gauging preserves the same cancellation mechanism, maintaining compatibility with direct-detection null results. We perform a systematic parameter scan imposing relic density, direct- and indirect-detection, and neutrino trident constraints, and identify viable sub-TeV to TeV DM candidates. Assuming maximal capture in NSs, we find that the remaining parameter space can be tested by near-infrared observations of NSs, providing sensitivity complementary to terrestrial searches in regions that are currently weakly constrained.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of cross sections in proton-proton and antiproton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy dependence of global scattering parameters, mostly of total cross section, is studied for proton-proton and antiproton-proton collisions. Results are presented for physical analysis updated with taken into account the recent data from accelerator experiments as well as from cosmic ray measurements. The analytic parameterizations suggested within Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) provide the quantitative description of energy dependence of global scattering parameters for rather wide energy range. Detailed scan on low boundary of the fitting range for energy dependence of global scattering parameters allows the observation of the onsets for regions in which Pomeranchuk theorem and / or Froissart-Martin one is valid. It is obtained that global scattering parameters show the behavior corresponded to any formulations of Pomeranchuk theorem and closed to (modified) Froissart-Martin limit in functional sense in multi-TeV energy region. Bosonic condensation is considered as one of the possible dynamical mechanisms which would be provide the total cross section approaches to (modified) Froissart-Martin limit at quantitative level but not functionally only.</description>

      <title>Production of dark matter in association with a Higgs boson via exclusive photon fusion in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the production of a dark matter (DM) particle in association with a Higgs boson via a central exclusive photon-fusion initiated process. We explore this type of production through the Inert Doublet Model plus a complex Singlet (IDMS), where an extension of the Standard Model by an additional $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and a $SU(2)$ inert scalar doublet gives rise to a DM candidate $\chi$. This particular process involves the collision of two protons exchanging two colorless particles (in our case, photons), from which a central process occurs. Such interaction can be detected in the LHC using forward proton detectors, where the resulting missing mass spectrum can be observed after proton reconstruction, thus allowing a search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We present results for different values of the difference of masses of a heavy scalar coming from the complex singlet, the DM candidate and the Higgs boson, $\Delta = M_S - M_\chi - M_h$, which is the phase space available for the final state in the central exclusive process.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 5. Cosmological Constraints with Simulation-Based Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the public DESI full-shape clustering data using simulation-based priors (SBPs). Our priors are obtained by fitting normalizing flows to the distribution of EFT parameters measured from field-level simulations, themselves generated using tailored halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for each tracer. Incorporating SBPs in a power spectrum analysis significantly enhances $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameter constraints; in combination with BAO information from DESI DR2 and a BBN prior on the baryon density, we find the matter density parameter $\Omega_m=0.2987\pm 0.0066$, the Hubble constant $H_0=68.80\pm 0.35\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.766\pm 0.015$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8=0.764\pm 0.018$), which are $1\%$, $40\%$ and $50\%$ stronger than the baseline results, though with a notable downwards shift in $\sigma_8$. The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\%$ ($20\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2\sigma$ ($1.4\sigma$) in analyses without (with) supernovae. The neutrino mass constraints are also enhanced, with the $95\%$ limits $M_\nu&lt;0.073\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $M_\nu&lt;0.090\,\mathrm{eV}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM respectively. The latter is the strongest constraint obtained to date and reinforces the preference for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, regardless of the background dynamics. While our results are sensitive to HOD modeling assumptions, they clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of small-scale information can significantly sharpen cosmological parameter constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we perform a systematic investigation of cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects operative on charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$) production in fixed target proton-nucleus (p+A) collisions. Influence on charmonium production cross section due to the interplay of three different plausible CNM effects namely the initial-state parton energy loss, nuclear shadowing, and final-state absorption of the resonant states, are evaluated in detail. The available data on charmonium production in fixed target p+A collision experiments from SPS, Fermilab and HERA-B are examined for this purpose. The energy dependence of the observed $J/\psi$ production patterns are utilized to anticipate level of "normal" absorption in the upcoming proton induced collisions by NA60+ experiment at CERN SPS and CBM experiment at FAIR SIS100 accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Baryogenesis in $f(R)$ Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of a baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the Universe via gravitational baryogenesis is investigated for two f(R) modified theories of gravity, the widely used Starobinsky $f(R)=R+R^{2}/M^{2}$ model, and the recently proposed power-law model $f(R)=c_{1}R^{2+k/4}+c_{2}R+c_{3}$ of Odintsov and Oikonomou (2025) that is constructed from the slow-roll inflation parameters, and fits the new high-multipole CMB observations reported by the Planck and ACT collaborations for $k \sim -0.03$. The present investigation is undertaken in the Einstein frame. The motion of the scalaron is studied for the slow roll inflationary era using analytic approximate solutions obtained from its potential and, from these solutions, analytic expressions for the Ricci scalar, its time derivative, the Hubble parameter and the scale factor of the Universe. These expressions for the Starobinsky model were obtained first by Motohashi and Nishizawa (2012) but the expressions for the power-law model of Odintsov and Oikonomou and its generalization are new. The calculated values of the baryon asymmetry factor $\eta $ for the Starobinsky model vary from $(1.05 - 1.46) \times 10^{-11}$, and for the power-law model, from $(1.06 - 1.53) \times 10^{-11}$. The power-law values depend upon the unknown fitting parameters $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, and a future fit of the Odintsov and Oikonomou model to data could yield enhanced values. The values for $\eta$ depend upon a mass parameter $M_{\ast}$ which is expected to be of the order of $M_{Pl}=2.435 \times 10^{18}$ GeV. The values of $\eta$ for both models have been calculated for $M_{\ast}=M_{Pl}$ and are quite close to the observed value $\eta = 8.65 \times 10^{-11}$. Since $\eta \propto (M/M_{\ast})^{2}$, reducing $M_{\ast}$ slightly from $M_{Pl}$ to $0.4 M_{Pl}$ would bring the calculated values into agreement with the observed value.</description>

      <title>AI Agents for Variational Quantum Circuit Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) constitute a central building block of near-term quantum machine learning (QML), yet the principled design of expressive and trainable architectures remains a major open challenge. The VQC design space grows combinatorially with the number of qubits, layers, entanglement structures, and gate parameterizations, rendering manual circuit construction inefficient and often suboptimal. We introduce an autonomous agent-based framework for VQC architecture search that integrates high-level reasoning with a quantum simulation environment. The agent proposes candidate circuit architectures, evaluates them through fully automated training and validation pipelines, and iteratively improves its design strategy via performance-driven feedback. Empirically, we show that the agent autonomously evolves circuit architectures from simple initial ans\"atze toward increasingly expressive designs, progressively trying to improve task performance. This demonstrates that agentic AI can effectively navigate and refine the VQC design landscape with minimal human intervention, providing a scalable methodology for automated quantum model development in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime.</description>

      <title>Symbolic syzygy-constrained reduction rules for Feynman integrals and the LoopIn framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals with high powers of numerators or propagators, a demanding computational step in evaluating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. The algorithm allows us to avoid a large intermediate system of equations and instead focus on applying direct reduction rules to the integrals. We demonstrate the application of our algorithm with some highly non-trivial examples, namely rank-20 integrals for the double box with an external mass and the massless pentabox. We also achieve much faster IBP reduction for an example of scattering amplitudes for spinning black hole binary systems. Finally, we present LoopIn, a modular framework for automating multi-loop calculations, where the IBP techniques described here can be interfaced.</description>

      <title>Cosmic strings and domain walls: the impact of CMB $B$-mode data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse CMB constraints on stable networks of cosmic strings and domain walls using for the first time full Planck 2018 data together with BICEP/Keck 2018 $B$-mode measurements. The defect-induced anisotropies are computed using the Unconnected Segment Model for Nambu-Goto and Abelian-Higgs strings, as well as for stable domain walls, and included in a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis jointly varying all $\Lambda$CDM parameters, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the string/domain wall tension. No statistically significant evidence for defects is found, although we observe a mild preference for non-zero cosmic string tension. Our results improve previous constraints on the defect power spectrum by up to a factor of two. In the particular case of strings, the improvement is driven by the $B$-mode data, and is especially pronounced for Abelian-Higgs strings. We also present forecasts for upcoming Simons Observatory data and find that, with the baseline noise configuration, the constraints on the string tension could improve by about a factor of three. Finally, we assess the impact of Nambu-Goto string loops on CMB anisotropies in light of both current and future observations.</description>

      <title>IceCube's convex all-sky neutrino spectrum consistent with the magnetically powered corona scenario for active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy multimessenger background analyses over the past decade have provided evidence for a population of hidden neutrino sources that are opaque to GeV-TeV gamma rays, a picture bolstered by recent observations of the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. The coronal regions in the hearts of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been proposed as the most promising sites for such hidden nonthermal particle production, and NGC 1068 is expected to be the most neutrino-active galaxy for IceCube. We demonstrate that the latest all-sky neutrino spectrum, exhibiting a spectral bend around 3-30 TeV, is consistent with predictions of the magnetically powered corona scenario, and the models for the all-sky neutrino flux can simultaneously explain the multimessenger data from NGC 1068 within observational and modeling uncertainties. We further show, in a largely model-independent way, that the contribution from NGC 1068-like sources does not overshoot the observed medium-energy neutrino flux. Finally, we highlight the key role of the Eddington ratio, which can drive substantial variations in the predicted neutrino fluxes of nearby AGNs, and we encourage systematic multimessenger searches for the neutrino-brightest AGNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9810048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   Considering heavy stable neutrinos of 4th generation we calculate the relic density of such neutrinos in the Universe. Taking into account the condensation of heavy neutrinos in the Galaxy and applying the results of calculations to experimental data from underground experiments on search for WIMPs in elastic neutral current scattering on nuclei we found an exclusion region of neutrino mass 60 GeV &lt; m &lt; 290 GeV. The bounds obtained from present underground experiments while confirming the previous bounds derived from analysis of cosmic ray spectra are more relible ones. We discuss also the first indication of elastic scattering induced by WIMP in DAMA experiment finding a very narrow window of neutrino mass 45 GeV &lt; m &lt; 50 GeV compatible with the possible signal rate in the detector.</description>

Abstract: The minimal coupling of massless fermions to gravity does not allow for their gravitational production solely based on the expansion of the Universe. We argue that this changes in presence of realistic and potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We compute the resulting energy density of Weyl fermions at 1-loop using in--in formalism. If the initially massless fermions eventually acquire mass, this mechanism can explain the dark matter abundance in the Universe. Remarkably, it may be more efficient than conventional gravitational production of superheavy fermions.</description>

Abstract: The behavior of the gluon distribution of the proton in the low-$x$, low-$Q^2$ domain of deep inelastic electron-proton scattering (DIS) is being investigated. By considering two-gluon exchange as the dominant interaction in the low-$x$, low-$Q^2$ domain, we imply the well-known result of scaling of the photoabsorption cross section in terms of the scaling variable $\eta(W^2,Q^2)$. From this, we derive a reliable result for the gluon distribution at the leading order of the perturbative QCD improved parton model, based on evolution from a starting scale of $Q_0^2\cong 2$ GeV$^2$. The validity of evolution, when considering its quantitative modification at low-$Q^2$ without any alteration at larger values of $Q^2$, leads to a quantitative improvement in the extraction of the gluon distribution based on evolution from a starting scale of $Q^2$
  conventionally chosen as $Q^2= Q_0^2\cong 2$ GeV$^2$.</description>

Abstract: We work out the spatial density distributions corresponding to the axial-vector charge density operator for spin-1/2 systems using states described by sharply localized wave packets in arbitrary Lorentz-frames. The static approximation, leading to the frequently assumed Breit-frame distributions, is also considered.

Abstract: We study a Zee-Babu neutrino model in a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry, and we construct a model so that there are minimum free parameters (two complex parameters). We find only the normal hierarchy is allowed. Moreover, the allowed region to satisfy the neutrino oscillation data is localized at nearby $\tau=\omega$. The small absolute deviation plays a crucial role in fitting two mixings of $s^2_{23}$ and $s^2_{12}$. In addition, we obtain several predictions on Majorana and Dirac CP phases, and neutrinoless double beta decay as shown in our chi square numerical analysis. We also study modulus stabilization within the framework of non-supersymmetric models. In the end, we compute the expansion of modular forms at nearby $\tau=\omega$ in the Appendix so that one can apply them for a model and understand its analytical structure.</description>

      <title>Stamps of state on structure: Probing the state of ultralight dark matter via its density fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) candidates with very small masses, and correspondingly large number densities, have gained significant interest in recent years. These DM candidates are typically said to behave "classically". More specifically, they are often assumed to reside in an ensemble of coherent states. One notable exception to this scenario is when isocurvature fluctuations of the DM are produced during inflation (or more generally by any Bogoliubov transformation). In such contexts, the ultralight DM instead resides in a squeezed state. In this work, we demonstrate that these two scenarios can be distinguished via the statistics of the DM density fluctuations, such as the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. This provides a probe of the DM state which persists in the limit of large particle number and does not rely on any non-gravitational interactions of the DM. Importantly, the statistics of these two states differ when the modes of the squeezed state are all in-phase, as is the case at the end of inflation. Later cosmological dynamics may affect this configuration. Our work motivates future numerical studies of how cosmological dynamics may impact the initial squeezed state and the statistics of its density fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the interaction of photons with a scalar dark matter field \phi and we propose to use a single arm interferometer to reveal this interaction and constrain the parameters of the scalar dark matter model. By considering a beam of coherent light and two spatially separated squeezing operations, we show that the interaction of photons with scalar dark matter leads to an observable deviation in the outgoing light state, with respect to free evolution. Therefore the single arm interferometer may yield a novel revelation method for scalar dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap for neutrino charge assignments in $U(2)_F$ Flavor Models: Implications for LFV processes and leptonic anomalous magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build upon a simple $U(2)_F$ model of flavor, in which all fermion masses and mixing hierarchies arise from powers of two small parameters controlling $U(2)_F$ breaking. In the original formulation, an isomorphism to the discrete $D_6\times U(1)_F$ symmetry was invoked to generate a Majorana neutrino mass term. Here, we retain the successful features of that model for the charged leptons and quarks, while exploring alternative neutrino charge assignments within the $U(2)_F$ framework. This approach allows us to generate Majorana neutrino masses via the see-saw mechanism without introducing any additional symmetries nor invoking any isomorphism. We further examine the implications of our models for Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) decays, analyzing the processes $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$, $\tau\rightarrow\mu\gamma$ and $\tau\rightarrow e\gamma$ and their connection with the leptonic anomalous magnetic moments. We show that within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) approach the current limits on the branching ratios of $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$ LFV decays obtained in our $U(2)_F$ models are not compatible with the central value of the recent measurement of the $(g-2)_\mu$, thereby suggesting that either $(g-2)_\mu$ must be very close to the Standard Model predictions, as the latest experimental and theoretical results seem to suggest, or the invoked flavor symmetry is not appropriate to describe an anomalous muon magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic tomography of radial flow in the quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multimessenger approach to extract the effective radial flow of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by jointly analyzing thermal photon and dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions. A key feature of this method is that it circumvents the need for a directly unmeasurable reference -- the photon temperature in the absence of flow -- by establishing, within a calibrated model framework, a stable, approximately linear correlation with the dilepton-inferred temperature. This construction defines an experimentally constructible quantity, $v_r^\mathrm{eff}$, which reflects early-time collectivity and exhibits a strong correlation with the spacetime-averaged radial velocity of the QGP. Together with previous results linking dilepton slopes to the initial QGP temperature, our work establishes a consistent framework for electromagnetic tomography of the QGP. Our framework quantifies the experimental precision target, thereby providing a concrete roadmap for future measurements at RHIC and the LHC and opening a new avenue to probe the early-time dynamics of hot QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Evidence for BSM spin 0 and spin 2 resonances at LHC Possible Interpretations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09490v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nine statistically significant decay channels are observed in LHC data around a mass of 650 GeV. We interpret three of them as coming from a narrow resonance observed in $e^+e^-$ , 2 photons and ZZ which could be interpreted as a J=2 Kaluza Klein graviton candidate called T690 (T for tensor with J=2). This hypothesis is reinforced by noting that this signal disappears in ZZ when treated as a scalar. Given that the six other excesses have poor mass resolution, one cannot exclude the presence of an additional wide scalar resonance called H650. Assuming a Randall Sundrum model, we conclude that LHC observes the predicted sequence T376, T690 and T1000, as indicated by the data. At variance with the RS model, T690 weakly couples to gluon pairs, suggesting a composite model interpretation. Perturbative unitarity requirements predict $T^{++} \to W^+W^+$ and $T^+\to ZW$ resonances, again indicated by LHC data. This scenario offers excellent prospects for abundantly (109 events) producing a sequence of narrow resonances at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. For heavy scalars, the situation is less clear. Following ATLAS and CMS, we expect that the top loop contribution to the gluon-gluon fusion mechanism ggF could produce a deficit rather than an excess in the mass distribution of top pairs, which prevents a standard estimate of the statistical significance for heavy resonances. It seems that the pseudo-scalar and scalar resonances A490 and H650, indicated by other channels, create observable deviations in the t t analyses presented by ATLAS and CMS. The present note summarises these arguments and collects available indications in view of electing a future collider.</description>

      <title>From $U(1) \times U(1)$ Symmetry Breaking to Majoron Cosmology: Insights from NANOGrav 15-year Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of a modified majoron model motivated by the need to protect a global $U(1)$ symmetry from gravity-induced hard explicit breaking (by $d \leq 4$ operators) at the Planck scale. The model extends the Standard Model by introducing a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry, each spontaneously broken by a corresponding complex scalar singlet. This setup gives rise to a network of effectively global and local cosmic strings, whose stochastic gravitational wave signals can jointly account for the spectrum observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, particularly for majoron masses $m_{\chi} &lt; 10^{-23}$ eV. Although the fit is not as strong as that from supermassive black hole mergers, the model still provides an alternative explanation rooted in high-energy physics. The model also generates light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and avoids cosmological constraints from $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$, CMB anisotropies, and isocurvature fluctuations. Although the majoron can contribute to dark matter through thermal, coherent oscillation, and string-induced production mechanisms, its relic abundance remains subdominant in the NANOGrav-compatible region. In contrast, the measured dark matter relic density is achievable at higher $m_\chi$, though at the cost of tension with cosmological bounds. If the NANOGrav fits are viewed as constraints, given their comparatively lower Bayes factors, they yield bounds that are significantly stronger than those imposed by the CMB and other cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Monophotons from Scalar Portal Dark Matter at Neutrino Experiments</title>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate monophoton signatures arising from dark matter via a $2\to 3$ scattering process $\chi + N \to \chi + N + \gamma$ that is mediated by a virtual scalar and a Standard Model photon. Since the final-state photon carries a large fraction of the initial dark matter's energy, this process offers a compelling handle for probing scalar portal dark matter scenarios. Their distinctive energy, angular, and timing distributions allow for effective separation of signal from neutrino-induced backgrounds. We analyze several models featuring different couplings to the scalar mediator, with the scalar photon coupling serving as the common detection channel. To distinguish between the models, we further examined their distinct spatial distributions. We considered the flux of dark matter produced both at the target and absorber of neutrino facilities such as the BNB, NuMI, and LBNF, and investigated the sensitivities at the ongoing SBND, ICARUS-NuMI, and future DUNE ND detectors. We further investigated the differences in the DM fluxes arising from various production mechanisms, as well as the distinctions between the target and absorber contributions. Our results demonstrate that the sensitivities at the considered experiments, especially DUNE ND, can place significantly improved constraints on viable parameter space in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>(Non-)Perturbative Dynamics of a Light QCD Axion: Dark Matter and the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable theoretical efforts have gone into expanding the reach of the QCD axion beyond its canonical mass--decay-constant relation. The $Z_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion model reduces the QCD axion mass naturally, by invoking a discrete $Z_\mathcal{N}$ symmetry through which the axion field is coupled to $\mathcal{N}$ copies of the Standard Model. Before the QCD phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm QCD}$, the $Z_\mathcal{N}$ potential has a minimum at misalignment angle $\theta=\pi$. At $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta =\pi$ becomes a maximum; the axion potential becomes exponentially suppressed and develops $\mathcal{N}$ minima -- only one of which actually solves the strong CP problem. Before $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta$ relaxes towards $\pi$. After $T_{\rm QCD}$, the axion field starts from around the hilltop and may have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the newly suppressed potential barriers. Such a field evolution leads to nonlinear effects via the self-interactions near the hilltop, which can cause the exponential growth of fluctuations and backreaction on the coherent motion. This behavior can influence the relic density of the field and the minimum in which it settles. We conduct the first lattice simulations of the $Z_{\mathcal{N}}$ QCD axion using ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice to accurately calculate dark matter abundances and find nonlinear dynamics reduce the abundance by up to a factor of two. We furthermore find that the probability of solving the strong CP problem tends to diverge considerably from the naive expectation of $1/\mathcal{N}$.</description>

      <title>Probing scalar non-standard interaction of supernova neutrinos in next-generation neutrino experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new neutrino-matter interaction can potentially affect neutrino propagation through matter. In this work, we explore the impact of a flavor-conserving scalar-mediated non-standard neutrino interaction in the supernova neutrino flux. We observe that the presence of a scalar interaction involving muon and tau neutrinos (parameterized as $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ and $\eta_{\tau\tau}$, respectively) can invert the neutrino mass eigenstate in which three neutrino flavor states are produced inside the supernova core, resulting in a significant modification of the electron neutrino flux from the supernova reaching the Earth. In the context of the DUNE experiment, we estimate the number of supernova neutrino events in the presence of scalar non-standard neutrino interaction $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ or $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ and contrast with the case without scalar-mediated non-standard interactions. Our results indicate that such scalar interactions introduce a new degeneracy in the measurement of neutrino mass ordering from supernova neutrinos. We show how the $\bar{\nu}_e$ event distribution in Hyper-Kamiokande experiment may help resolve the degeneracy between a model with new scalar interactions for normal ordered neutrino masses and the standard model with inverted mass ordering for a galactic supernova.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for jet modification in the presence of the QGP background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet interactions with the color-deconfined QCD medium in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are conventionally assessed by measuring the modification of the distributions of jet observables with respect to their baselines in proton-proton collisions. Deep learning methods enable per-jet evaluation of these modifications, enhancing the use of jets as precision probes of the nuclear medium. In this work, we predict the jet-by-jet fractional energy loss $\chi$ for jets evolving through a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium using a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. To approximate realistic experimental conditions, we embed medium-modified jets in a thermal background and apply Constituent Subtraction for background removal. Two network architectures are studied: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using jet images, and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) using particle clouds. We find that CNNs achieve accurate predictions for background-free jets but degrade in the presence of the QGP background and remain below the background-free baseline even after background subtraction. In contrast, DGCNNs applied to background-subtracted particle clouds maintain high accuracy across the entire $\chi$ range, demonstrating the advantage of point-cloud-based graph neural networks that exploit full jet structure under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Monojet and direct detection constraints on real scalar dark matter: EFT and a simple UV completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider constraints that can be placed on certain invisible scalar particles through monojet studies at the LHC and compare them with those from direct detection experiments when interpreted as dark matter. Whereas direct detection constraints are typically more restrictive, we identify regions of parameter space where monojet studies provide important complementary bounds. We carry out our analysis using both a $\phi$SMEFT for real scalar particle pairs coupled to standard-model fields through operators of up to dimension six, and a simple UV completion with vector-like quarks, with both the scalars and the vector-like quarks being odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, while the SM particles are even. The vector-like quarks can only decay into a jet and an invisible scalar, and we recast the current ATLAS monojet data to constrain their parameter space. Comparison of the two descriptions yields some insight into interpreting dark matter constraints obtained with EFTs.</description>

      <title>Boosting long lived particles searches at $\mu$TRISTAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the prospects of the proposed $\mu$TRISTAN experiment, running in the energy asymmetric $\mu^+ e^-$ mode, in probing long lived particles (LLPs) arising from the decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson. We focus on the proposed runs with $\{E_{\mu^+}, E_{e^-}\} = \{1\,{\rm TeV},\,30\,{\rm GeV}\}$ and $\{E_{\mu^+}, E_{e^-}\} = \{3\,{\rm TeV},\,50\,{\rm GeV}\}$ and we show that, owing to the boosted nature of the produced events, a far detector placed along the beam line can collect a large fraction of the LLP flux. This allows one to set bounds on the exotic Higgs branching ratio which, for specific $\phi$ decay modes, can surpass those expected at the end of the High Luminosity LHC in the regime of large LLPs proper decay lengths. On the other hand, we find that the proposed strategy will not be able to further extend the limits that might be set by proposed LHC far detectors such as CODEX-b, ANUBIS and MATHUSLA.</description>

Abstract: The tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon are defined through the matrix element of the tensor current and describe its internal structure and spin distribution. We present the full Lorentz decomposition for the $\Delta^+ \rightarrow \Delta^+$ tensor current matrix element, including all independent structures consistent with Lorentz covariance, the Rarita-Schwinger constraints, and the discrete symmetries of Hermiticity, time-reversal, and parity invariance. By investigating the tensor form factors corresponding to both the isovector and isoscalar tensor currents, we observe differences that reflect the distinct contributions of up and down quark components in the $\Delta^+$ baryon.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-preserving calculation of pion light-front wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poincar\'e-covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions are used to calculate light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion, $\pi$, and an analogue state, $\pi_{s\bar s}$. The current masses of the degenerate valence constituents in the $\pi_{s\bar s}$ are around $25$-times larger than those of the pion's valence constituents. Both valence spin-antialigned ($\mathcal L=0$) and valence spin-aligned ($\mathcal L=1$) components are obtained and combined to produce the complete LFWF for each system. Comparing predictions delivered by two distinct Bethe-Salpeter kernels, the impact of nonperturbative dynamical effects contained in the more sophisticated (bRL) kernel are seen to be significant; and contrasts between $\pi$, $\pi_{s \bar s}$ results reveal the interplay between emergent hadron mass and mass effects owing to Higgs-boson couplings. Amongst the results, one finds that for $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$, the LFWFs can be approximated by a separable form, with that representation being pointwise reliable in the bRL cases. Moreover, the $\mathcal L=1$ component is important; so a LFWF obtained after omission of this piece is typically a poor representation of the system. These features are naturally expressed in $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$ transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). In this connection, it is found that a Gaussian \textit{Ansatz} can only provide a rough guide to TMD pointwise behaviour: magnitude deviations between \textit{Ansatz} and prediction exceed a factor of two on $k_\perp^2 \gtrsim 0.55\,$GeV$^2$. One should therefore be cautious in interpreting conclusions drawn from phenomenological analyses based upon Gaussian \textit{Ans\"atze}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atomki anomaly puts forward the hypothesis of an $X(17)$ particle to explain the observation. Utilizing experimental data from the Atomki experiments, measurements of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment, beam dump experiments, the KLOE-2 experiment, the PADME experiment, and parity-violating M{\o}ller scattering experiment, we derive constraints on the couplings of the $X(17)$ boson to electrons. Our findings indicate that no viable parameter spaces exist for the pseudoscalar, scalar, vector, axial-vector, and vector$\pm$axial-vector models describing the couplings of $X(17)$ to electrons. The Atomki anomaly may not correspond to signals of New Physics, but rather to some nuclear effect that remains poorly understood.</description>

      <title>Neutrino production mechanisms in strongly magnetized quark matter: Current status and open questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the main neutrino emission mechanisms operating in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with particular emphasis on conditions expected in the interiors of compact stars. We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $\nu\bar{\nu}$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars.</description>

Abstract: Tensor form factors encode essential information about the internal spin structure and tensor dynamics of baryons. In this work, we investigate the tensor form factors of the baryon hyperons $\Omega^-$, $\Sigma^{*+}$, and $\Xi^{*-}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. The complete set of tensor form factors is numerically evaluated in the momentum transfer region $0&lt;Q^2&lt;10~\text{GeV}^2$. In addition, the quark tensor charges of the considered hyperons are extracted in the forward limit. The results provide new non-perturbative insight into the tensor structure and spin content of spin-$3/2$ baryons and offer valuable theoretical input for future phenomenological analyses and experimental studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of the nuclear dependence of two-particle-two-hole meson-exchange current contributions to inclusive lepton-nucleus scattering within the relativistic mean-field framework. We present microscopic calculations of nuclear responses for a set of 17 nuclei, ranging from helium to uranium, using a model with different Fermi momenta for protons and neutrons. We propose a novel scaling prescription based on the two-particle phase space and key nuclear parameters. The resulting description is accurate over a wide range of nuclear targets, with typical deviations below 10\%, and allows for a separate treatment of the different emission channels. In addition, a consistent benchmark against electron-scattering data is provided. The parametrization presented provides a practical framework for extending the responses to different nuclear targets in neutrino event generators.</description>

We further derive the three-loop relation between the pole mass and the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ mass of a heavy quark, including the complete mixed QCD+QED contributions. The corresponding quark-mass anomalous dimension in the presence of both interactions is also extracted. Moreover, we provide the explicit conversion formulae, up to the same perturbative order, between the pole mass and the trace-anomaly subtracted $\sigma$-mass of heavy quark.</description>

      <title>Residue-Enhanced Pion-Rho Mixing as the Origin of Nonmonotonic Charged Pion Mass in Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the dynamical origin of the non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of the charged pion mass observed in lattice QCD. Using a near-pole effective action derived from the SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, we show that the lowest Landau level charged pion mixes with the longitudinally polarized charged rho meson, which shares the same quantum numbers in a magnetic background. This mixing, generated by quark-loop polarization and a gauge-invariant tree-level operator matched to the vacuum decay $\rho^\pm\rightarrow\pi^\pm\gamma$, induces strong level repulsion. Crucially, this effect is dynamically amplified by a rapid suppression of the rho-meson wave function renormalization near the pole. As a result, the lower eigenmode exhibits a turnover as the magnetic field increases. The mechanism is analogous to singlet-triplet mixing in positronium and provides a natural explanation for the lattice results. Such effects are expected to be generic for charged mesons in magnetic fields when symmetry allowed mixing and near-pole residue suppression are present.</description>

Abstract: High-energy neutrinos are traditionally regarded as unambiguous signatures of hadronic cosmic rays in astrophysical environments. Here we show that TeV neutrinos can instead be produced by energetic electrons through purely electromagnetic processes in a variety of potential cosmic-ray accelerators. The resulting fluxes are comparable to those expected from hadronic interactions, suggesting that electrons may contribute a significant fraction of the neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. These findings challenge the conventional interpretation of neutrino origins and underscore the need for joint gamma-ray and neutrino observations over a broad energy range to discriminate between hadronic and leptonic production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Nuclear cluster structure effect in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at the top RHIC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the improved string-melting version of a Multi-Phase Transport model, we investigated the impact of nuclear geometry of $^{16}$O on anisotropic flows in O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV. To evaluate the influence of nuclear structure and potential alpha clustering, we implemented four candidate configurations: Woods-Saxon, tetrahedron, square, and Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory. Initial-state geometry is quantified via the eccentricity cumulant ratio $\varepsilon_{2}\{4\}/\varepsilon_{2}\{2\}$, which provides a robust and evolution-independent measure sensitive to configuration differences. The model reproduces $v_{2}(p_{\rm T})$ at low $p_{\rm T}$ and $v_{3}(p_{\rm T})$ across the full $p_{\rm T}$ range, with integrated $v_{2}\{2\}$ and $v_{3}\{2\}$ matching the STAR data, demonstrating that transport dynamics captures the essential collectivity in this intermediate-size system. These findings establish a baseline for extending nuclear-structure studies in O+O collisions to other energies and differential observables within a unified transport model framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal interactions are ubiquitous in the cosmos, driving systems toward equilibrium. In this work, we investigate the evolution of thermal states across the early universe, encompassing the inflationary, radiation-dominated (RD), and matter-dominated (MD) eras, through the lens of Krylov complexity. Utilizing a purification scheme, we map the thermal state to a two-mode pure state, facilitating an open-system analysis of Krylov complexity in contrast to closed-system methodologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that Krylov complexity grows exponentially during inflation, indicating chaotic behavior, before saturating at nearly constant values in the RD and MD eras due to particle production via preheating. Furthermore, we analyze the Krylov entropy, which exhibits an evolutionary trend analogous to that of complexity. Crucially, our analysis reveals a dynamical transition in the universe's dissipative nature: with the universe acting as a strongly dissipative system during inflation and transitioning to a weakly dissipative regime in the subsequent eras. These findings provide a novel quantum information perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of coupled dark energy and dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers. In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions. We also compute the effective DM gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$ by using a quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the DE sound horizon and show that the existence of momentum and energy transfers allow a possibility to realize $G_{\rm eff}$ smaller than in the uncoupled case at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Pathfinding Quantum Simulations of Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from co-designed quantum simulations of the neutrinoless double-beta decay of a simple nucleus in 1+1D quantum chromodynamics using IonQ's Forte-generation trapped-ion quantum computers. Electrons, neutrinos, and up and down quarks are distributed across two lattice sites and mapped to 32 qubits, with an additional 4 qubits used for flag-based error mitigation. A four-fermion interaction is used to implement weak interactions, and lepton-number violation is induced by a neutrino Majorana mass. Quantum circuits that prepare the initial nucleus and time evolve with the Hamiltonian containing the strong and weak interactions are executed on IonQ Forte Enterprise. Enabled by tuned model parameters, lepton-number violation is observed in real time, providing a clear signal of neutrinoless double-beta decay. This was made possible by co-designing the simulation to maximally utilize the all-to-all connectivity and native gate-set available on IonQ's quantum computers. Quantum circuit compilation techniques and co-designed error-mitigation methods, informed from executing benchmarking circuits with up to 2,356 two-qubit gates, enabled observables to be extracted with high precision. We discuss the potential of future quantum simulations to provide yocto-second resolution of the reaction pathways in these, and other, nuclear processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological production of scalar, non-minimally coupled dark matter depends on the specifics of the inflationary model under consideration. We analyze both Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic potential, solve the full background dynamics, study pair production during inflation and reheating, and find that the observed dark matter abundance can be explained solely by this mechanism, regardless of the inflationary model. Qualitative differences between the two cases only appear for dark matter masses close to the inflationary scale. In addition, we identify a large region in parameter space in which cosmological production of dark matter is mostly independent of the chosen inflationary potential, highlighting the robustness of this dark matter production mechanism and its independence of the unknown particular details of inflation. In the region of masses lower than the scale of inflation, and sufficiently away from the conformal limit, the total comoving number density of produced particles becomes a function of the coupling to the geometry alone. This allows us to provide an approximated analytic expression for fitting the resulting abundance.</description>

      <title>An Open System Approach to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime. As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework in Feynman-parameter space to determine constraints on the sequential discontinuities of Feynman integrals. Our method is based on tracking the deformation of the integration contour as external kinematics are analytically continued. This procedure imposes powerful constraints on the analytic structure of Feynman integrals, providing crucial inputs for their bootstrap. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by applying it to integrals in dimensional regularization, with higher propagator powers, and to examples with non-uniform transcendental weight. The method is illustrated with several one- and two-loop calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a stochastic generalisation of the Schwinger effect, extending pair production to statistically fluctuating gauge-field backgrounds. Our approach captures realistic field configurations that are transient, inhomogeneous, and stochastic, as commonly encountered in cosmological and high-energy astrophysical settings. Using the effective action formalism, we compute the vacuum decay rate and number density of charged particles, obtaining closed-form analytical expressions for both scalar and fermionic cases. To isolate the essential physics, the analysis is performed in flat spacetime and at zero temperature, providing a controlled setting in which curvature and thermal effects can be neglected. As a proof of concept, we present representative phenomenological examples relevant to astrophysical plasmas and early-Universe-motivated scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie--Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the nonstandard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. {}Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anticorrelation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>Anomaly induced transport from symmetry breaking in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.</description>

      <title>Bound States in Lee's Complex Ghost Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories (QFTs) including fourth-derivative terms such as the Lee-Wick finite QED and quadratic gravity have a better ultra-violet behavior compared to standard theories with second-derivative ones, but the existence of ghost with negative norm endangers unitarity. Such a ghost in general acquires a pair of complex conjugate masses from radiative corrections whose features are concisely described by the so-called Lee model. Working with the canonical operator formalism of QFTs, we investigate the issue of bound states in the Lee model. We find that the bound states cannot be created from ghosts by contributions of a complex delta function, which is a complex generalization of the well-known Dirac delta function. Since the cause of unitarity violation in the Lee-Wick model is the existence of the complex delta function instead of the Dirac delta function, it is of interest to notice that the violation of the unitarity is also connected to the non-existence of bound states. Finally, the problem of amelioration of the unitarity in quadratic gravity is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply score-based diffusion models to two-dimensional SU(2) lattice pure gauge theory with the Wilson action, extending recent work on U(1) gauge theories. The SU(2) manifold structure is handled through a quaternion parameterization. The model is trained on 10,000 configurations generated via Hybrid Monte Carlo at a fixed coupling $\beta_0= 2.0$ on an $8\times 8$ lattice, augmented to 20,000 samples via random gauge transformations. Through physics-conditioned sampling exploiting the linear $\beta$-dependence of the score function, we generate configurations at different values of the coupling without retraining; through the fully convolutional U-Net architecture with periodic boundary conditions, we generate configurations on lattices of different spatial extents. We validate our approach by comparing the average plaquette and Wilson action density against exact analytical predictions. At the training lattice size ($8\times 8$), the model reproduces the exact plaquette with biases $|\Delta| \leq 0.001$ for $\beta \in [1.5, 2.5]$ and $|\Delta| &lt; 0.06$ across $\beta \in [1, 4]$. For lattices sharing the training extent $L=8$ in at least one direction, biases remain below $\sim 0.003$ for $\beta \in [1.5, 2.5]$, with larger deviations at higher couplings. This work demonstrates that diffusion models are a promising tool for non-Abelian gauge field generation and motivates further investigation toward higher-dimensional theories.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a renormalization-group invariant observable, the symmetry strength parameter $\kappa_{AB}$, for the quantitative characterization of symmetry breaking in QCD. As a first application, we employ $\kappa_{AB}$ to investigate the relative strength of $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry breaking in $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD using optimal domain-wall fermions at the physical point. Our study covers three lattice spacings and twelve temperatures in the range 164-385~MeV. We examine three independent symmetry-breaking channels in the nonsinglet sector with connected correlators: the $U(1)_A$-sensitive scalar-pseudoscalar channel ($\kappa_{PS}$), probing the $\pi$-$\delta$ system; the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$-sensitive vector--axial-vector channel ($\kappa_{VA}$), probing the $\rho$-$a_1$ system; and an additional $U(1)_A$-sensitive tensor--axial-tensor channel ($\kappa_{TX}$), probing the $\rho_T$-$b_1$ system. At finite lattice spacing, we observe a clear hierarchy $\kappa_{PS} &gt; \kappa_{TX} \sim \kappa_{VA}$. A controlled continuum extrapolation reveals that this hierarchy collapses, with all three symmetry-breaking strengths becoming statistically indistinguishable within our precision. This result provides a new, model-independent benchmark from a chirally symmetric lattice action. Our findings indicate that the effective restoration scales for $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_A$ in the nonsinglet sector converge closely near the chiral crossover, placing stringent quantitative constraints on the temperature window for chiral and axial symmetry manifestation in connected channels. These results support a two-stage restoration scenario, in which full symmetry restoration -- including the singlet sector -- occurs only at significantly higher temperatures once topological fluctuations are sufficiently suppressed.</description>
