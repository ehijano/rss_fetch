      <title>Study of the relativistic charged particle beam propagation in Earth's magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic charged particle beam can be used as destructive beam weapons in space for debris removal tasks. The trajectories of charged particles are affected by both electric and magnetic forces in the Earth's magnetic field. In this paper, we firstly analyzed the correlation parameters of the charged particle beam as a weapon when it propagated in the geomagnetic field. Then the models were constructed based on COMSOL Multiphysics and the IGRF model was adopted in the simulation. The gyro-radius and the related uncertainty were analyzed by simulation of the charged particle transport in the geomagnetic field at different altitudes. The charged beam spot radius divergency was also simulated. The magnetic field pinch effect can be found and can limit the beam spreading.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between a moderate level of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- - 5+), and solar wind conditions were revealed based on Potential Learning (PL), and dependence of particular solar wind plasma density (NP) on moderate geomagnetic conditions was discussed. It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity NP begins to control the Kp level. Previously, PL succeeded to extract the most influential solar wind parameters at an extremely low (0 - 1+) and high (6- - 9) Kp ranges under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed (VX), and NP obtained from the 21-year OMNI solar wind database were used as the PL input parameters. PL extracted VX as the most significant parameter for the moderate Kp level under southward IMF conditions and NP is the second most influential parameter. Based on the examination of the statistical relationship between VX and NP under extremely low, high, and moderate Kp levels using the PL database, geomagnetic conditions remain high while NP becomes large, even if VX decreases (or remains similar). This shows that both VX and NP govern geomagnetic activity, following the relational equation between Kp and the solar wind plasma parameter. Based on the relation between VX and NP clarified by PL and incidental statistical studies using PL input data, we also revealed that NP begins to affect the Kp level from moderate geomagnetic activity level. These results suggest that even under southward IMF conditions, the geomagnetic activity might be influenced by fast (slow) VX and low (high) NP. Our results would greatly help understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions, and forecast the geomagnetic activity under extreme solar wind conditions.</description>

      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation: in particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude by discussing the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that two prominent theories of ion heating in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas -- stochastic and quasi-linear heating -- represent similar physical processes in turbulence with different normalized cross helicities. To capture both, we propose a simple phenomenology based on the power in scales at which critically balanced fluctuations reach their smallest parallel scale. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as relevant to the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Size distribution of small grains in the inner zodiacal cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft has transited the inner-most regions of the zodiacal cloud and detects impacts to the spacecraft body via its electric field instrument. Multiple dust populations have been proposed to explain the PSP dust impact rates. PSP's unique orbit allows us to identify a region where the impact rates are likely dominated by $\alpha$-meteoroids, small zodiacal grains on approximately circular, bound orbits. From the distribution of voltage signals generated by dust impacts to PSP in this region, we find the cumulative mass index for grains with radii of $\sim$0.6-1.4 $\mu$m (masses of $3\times10^{-15}$ to $3\times10^{-14}$ kg) to be $\alpha = 1.1 \pm 0.3$ from 0.1-0.25 $R_\odot$. $\alpha$ increases toward the Sun, with even smaller fragments generated closer to the Sun. The derived size distribution is steeper than previously estimated, and in contrast to expectations we find most of the dust mass resides in the smallest fragments and not in large grains inside 0.15 au. As the inner-most regions of the zodiacal cloud are likely collisionally evolved, these results place new constraints how the solar system's zodiacal cloud and by extension astrophysical debris disks are partitioned in mass.</description>
