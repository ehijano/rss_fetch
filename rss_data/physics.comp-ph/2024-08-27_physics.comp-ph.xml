      <title>Accelerating material melting temperature predictions by implementing machine learning potentials in the SLUSCHI package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SLUSCHI (Solid and Liquid in Ultra Small Coexistence with Hovering Interfaces) automated package, with interface to the first-principles code VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package), was developed by us for efficiently determining the melting temperatures of various materials. However, performing many molecular dynamics simulations for small liquid-solid coexisting supercells to predict the melting temperature of a material is still computationally expensive, often requiring weeks and tens to hundreds of thousands of CPU hours to complete. In the present paper, we made an attempt to interface the SLUSCHI package with the highly efficient molecular dynamics LAMMPS code and demonstrated that it achieves a much faster melting temperature determination, outperforming the original VASP-based approach by at least one order of magnitude. In our melting temperature calculations, the LAMMPS simulations were performed based on the LASP (Large-scale Atomic Simulation) machine learning potentials which are pre-built using first-principles data. Besides the dramatic CPU time reduction for melting temperature predictions the calculated melting temperatures for various materials (simple and transition metals, alloys, oxides and carbide) are reasonably accurate. Analysis of the calculated results shows that 60% of the melting temperatures are within 200 K of experimental values with the RMSE value of 187 K which is slightly worse than the first-principles DFT RMSE value of 151 K. Therefore, interfacing SLUSCHI with LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations makes it possible to quickly screen out the best candidates from numerous materials in a much more efficient way, and facilitate the rational design of materials within the framework of the materials genome paradigm.</description>

      <title>Quantized Embedding Approaches for Collective Strong Coupling -- Connecting ab initio and macroscopic QED to Simple Models in Polaritonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective light-matter interactions have been used to control chemistry and energy transfer, yet accessible approaches that combine ab initio methodology with large many-body quantum optical systems are missing due to the fast increase in computational cost for explicit simulations. We introduce an accessible ab initio quantum embedding concept for many-body quantum optical systems that allows to treat the collective coupling of molecular many-body systems effectively in the spirit of macroscopic QED while keeping the rigor of ab initio quantum chemistry for the molecular structure. Our approach fully includes the quantum fluctuations of the polaritonic field and yet remains much simpler and more intuitive than complex embedding approaches such as dynamical mean-field theory. We illustrate the underlying assumptions by comparison to the Tavis--Cummings model. The intuitive application of the quantized embedding approach and its transparent limitations offer a practical framework for the field of ab initio polaritonic chemistry to describe collective effects in realistic molecular ensembles.</description>

      <title>Full- and low-rank exponential Euler integrators for the Lindblad equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation is a widely used quantum master equation to model the dynamical evolution of open quantum systems whose states are described by density matrices. These solution matrices are characterized by semi-positiveness and trace preserving properties, which must be guaranteed in any physically meaningful numerical simulation. In this paper, novel full- and low-rank exponential Euler integrators are developed for approximating the Lindblad equation that preserve positivity and trace unconditionally. Theoretical results are presented that provide sharp error estimates for the two classes of exponential integration methods. Results of numerical experiments are discussed that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, beyond present state-of-the-art capabilities.</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin Carbon Biphenylene Network as an Anisotropic Thermoelectric Material with High Temperature Stability Under Mechanical Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon biphenylene network (C-BPN), which is an ultra-thin material consisting of carbon atoms arranged in square-hexagonal-octagonal (4-6-8) periodic rings, has intriguing properties for nano-scale device design due to its unique crystal structure. Here, using the Landauer formalism in combination with first-principles calculations, we show that C-BPN is a highly stable thermoelectric material at elevated temperatures under mechanical strain, where its thermoelectric efficiency can be anisotropically engineered. Transport calculations reveal that C-BPN's transmission spectrum has significant degrees of directional anisotropy and it undergoes a metal-insulator transition under strain, which leads to an increase in its Seebeck coefficient. C-BPN's lattice thermal conductance can be selectively tuned up to 35% bidirectionally at room temperature by strain engineering. Enhancement in its power factor and the suppression of its lattice thermal conductance improves the p-type figure of merit up to 0.31 and 0.76 at 300 and 1000~K, respectively. Our findings reveal that C-BPN has high potency to be used in thermoelectric nano devices with selective anisotropic properties at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>RiD-kit: Software package designed to do enhanced sampling using reinforced dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing an efficient method to accelerate the speed of molecular dynamics is a central theme in the field of molecular simulation. One category among the methods are collective-variable-based methods, which rely on predefined collective variables (CVs). The difficulty of selecting a few important CVs hinders the methods to be applied to large systems easily. Here we present a CV-based enhanced sampling method RiD-kit, which could handle a large number of CVs and perform efficient sampling. The method could be applied to various kinds of systems, including biomolecules, chemical reactions and materials. In this protocol, we guide the users through all phases of the RiD-kit workflow, from preparing the input files, setting the simulation parameters and analyzing the results. The RiD-kit workflow provides an efficient and user-friendly command line tool which could submit jobs to various kinds of platforms including the high-performance computers (HPC), cloud server and local machines.</description>

      <title>An open-source, adaptive solver for particle-resolved simulations with both subcycling and non-subcycling methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the IAMReX, an adaptive and parallel solver for particle-resolved simulations on the multi-level grid. The fluid equations are solved using a finite-volume scheme on the block-structured semi-staggered grids with both subcycling and non-subcycling methods. The particle-fluid interaction is resolved using the multidirect forcing immersed boundary method. The associated Lagrangian markers used to resolve fluid-particle interface only exist on the finest-level grid, which greatly reduces memory usage. The volume integrals are numerically calculated to capture the free motion of particles accurately, and the repulsive potential model is also included to account for the particle-particle collision. We demonstrate the versatility, accuracy, and efficiency of the present multi-level framework by simulating fluid-particle interaction problems with various types of kinematic constraints. The cluster of monodisperse particles case is presented at the end to show the capability of the current solver in handing with multiple particles. The source code and testing cases used in this work can be accessed at https://github.com/ruohai0925/IAMR/tree/development. Input scripts and raw postprocessing data are also available for reproducing all results.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Design of Au-Based Alloys for Improved Plasmon Delivery and Nanoheating in Near-Field Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic near-field transducers (NFTs) play a key role in administering nanoscale heating for a number of applications ranging from medical devices to next generation data processing technology. We present a novel multi-scale approach, combining quantum many-body perturbation theory with finite-element modelling, to predict the electric and thermal material parameters of various Au-based, noble metal (M) alloys. Specifically, we focus on modelling their performance within an NFT designed to focus high-intensity, sub-diffracted light for technologies such as nanoscale etching, manipulation, sensing, and heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). Elemental Au is the long-standing general-purpose NFT medium due its excellent plasmonic performance at relevant wavelengths. However, elemental Au is a soft, ductile material that tends to extrude and deform in response to extreme temperature gradients. Therefore, alloying Au with other noble metals such as Ag, Cu, Pd or Pt, has attracted considerable interest for improved mechanical and thermal robustness while reaching threshold plasmonic generation at standard optoelectronics operating wavelengths (e.g., $\approx 830$~nm) and approximate high-power NFT temperatures ($\approx 400$~K). We predict that certain Au-Ag alloys may offer improved thermal stability as whole-NFT media compared to elemental Au, alongside plasmonic figures of merit comparable to that of Au. Simulations of certain solid solution Au-Pd/Pt alloys enable us to predict significantly enhanced thermal conductivity. We predict that alloying with Pd at low concentrations $\sim 10\%$ may preserve the NFT performance of Au, while offering the benefits of improved thermal and mechanical stability.</description>

      <title>The Quantization Monte Carlo method for solving radiative transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Quantization Monte Carlo method to solve thermal radiative transport equations with possibly several collision regimes, ranging from few collisions to massive number of collisions per time unit. For each particle in a given simulation cell, the proposed method advances the time by replacing many collisions with sampling directly from the escape distribution of the particle. In order to perform the sampling, for each triplet of parameters (opacity, remaining time, initial position in the cell) on a parameter grid, the escape distribution is precomputed offline and only the quantiles are retained. The online computation samples only from this quantized (i.e., discrete) version by choosing a parameter triplet on the grid (close to actual particle's parameters) and returning at random one quantile from the precomputed set of quantiles for that parameter. We first check numerically that the escape laws depend smoothly on the parameters and then implement the procedure on a benchmark with good results.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Monte Carlo Approximations to the Distribution of the First Passage Time of the Drifted Diffusion with Stochastic Resetting and Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces two techniques for computing the distribution of the absorption or first passage time of the drifted Wiener diffusion subject to Poisson resetting times, to an upper hard wall barrier and to a lower absorbing barrier. The first method, which we call ``Pad\'e-partial fraction'' approximation, starts with the Pad\'e approximation to the Laplace transform of the first passage time distribution, which is then exactly inverted by means of the partial fraction decomposition. The second method, which we call "multiresolution algorithm", is a Monte Carlo technique that exploits the properties of the Wiener process in order to generate Brownian bridges at increasing levels of resolution. Our numerical study reveals that the multiresolution algorithm has higher efficiency than standard Monte Carlo, whereas the faster Pad\'e-partial fraction method is accurate in various circumstances and provides an analytical formula. Also, a closed-form exact expression for the expected first passage time is derived.</description>

      <title>A Kaczmarz-inspired approach to accelerate the optimization of neural network wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network wavefunctions optimized using the variational Monte Carlo method have been shown to produce highly accurate results for the electronic structure of atoms and small molecules, but the high cost of optimizing such wavefunctions prevents their application to larger systems. We propose the Subsampled Projected-Increment Natural Gradient Descent (SPRING) optimizer to reduce this bottleneck. SPRING combines ideas from the recently introduced minimum-step stochastic reconfiguration optimizer (MinSR) and the classical randomized Kaczmarz method for solving linear least-squares problems. We demonstrate that SPRING outperforms both MinSR and the popular Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature method (KFAC) across a number of small atoms and molecules, given that the learning rates of all methods are optimally tuned. For example, on the oxygen atom, SPRING attains chemical accuracy after forty thousand training iterations, whereas both MinSR and KFAC fail to do so even after one hundred thousand iterations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unavailability of accurate boundary treatment methods for compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) severely limits its ability to simulate flows in and around bodies. To this end, challenges specific to compressible flows with SPH are carefully considered. Based on these, robust and widely applicable boundary treatment methods for compressible SPH are proposed. These are accompanied by a novel technique to prevent particle penetration at boundaries. The proposed methods are shown to be significantly better than other recent approaches. A wide variety of test problems, many of which are not shown to be simulated with SPH thus far, are employed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods. The implementation is open source and the results are automated in the interest of reproducibility. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of SPH as a viable alternative to mesh-based methods for compressible flow simulations.</description>

Abstract: Estimating force constants for crystal structures is crucial for calculating various phonon-related properties. However, this task becomes particularly challenging when dealing with a large number of atoms or when third- and higher-order force constants are required. In this study, we propose an efficient approach that involves constructing a complete orthonormal basis set for the force constants. We formulate this approach using projection matrices and their eigenvectors to meet the requirements for the force constants. This basis set enables precise inference of the force constants from displacement-force datasets. Our efficient algorithms for basis-set construction and force constant estimation are implemented in the symfc code. Furthermore, several applications demonstrated in this study indicate that the current approach facilitates the efficient and accurate determination of force constants.</description>

      <title>Convolutional hybrid-PIC modeling of non-neutral plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-neutral plasmas can excite many nonlinear plasma phenomena, e.g., collisionless shocks, sheath layers, solitons, and plasma plumes. It is a fundamental issue in fields such as astrophysics, space physics, nuclear fusion, and plasma propulsion. Hybrid PIC methods are currently the most commonly used techniques for simulating non-neutral plasmas. However, the numerical methods for solving hybrid PIC model of non-neutral plasma have some shortcomings. Here, a new method called convolutional hybrid-PIC (conv-HPIC) is proposed to address this problem. This method replaces the Poisson's equation in the hybrid PIC with a convolution equation. The conv-HPIC method avoids iteration, suppresses numerical noise and exhibits high computational efficiency. It is expected to become a powerful tool for exploring nonlinear phenomena in non-neutral plasmas.</description>

      <title>General non-linear fragmentation with discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dust grains play a significant role in several astrophysical processes, including gas/dust dynamics, chemical reactions, and radiative transfer. Replenishment of small-grain populations is mainly governed by fragmentation during pair-wise collisions between grains. The wide spectrum of fragmentation outcomes, from complete disruption to erosion and/or mass transfer, can be modelled by the general non-linear fragmentation equation. Efficiently solving this equation is crucial for an accurate treatment of the dust fragmentation in numerical modelling. However, similar to dust coagulation, numerical errors in current fragmentation algorithms employed in astrophysics are dominated by the numerical over-diffusion problem -- particularly in 3D hydrodynamic simulations where the discrete resolution of the mass density distribution tends to be highly limited. With this in mind, we have derived the first conservative form of the general non-linear fragmentation with a mass flux highlighting the mass transfer phenomenon. Then, to address cases of limited mass density resolution, we applied a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme to efficiently solve the conservative fragmentation equation with a reduced number of dust bins. An accuracy of 0.1 -1% is reached with 20 dust bins spanning a mass range of 9 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Optimal time sampling in physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18780</link>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) is a extremely powerful paradigm used to solve equations encountered in scientific computing applications. An important part of the procedure is the minimization of the equation residual which includes, when the equation is time-dependent, a time sampling. It was argued in the literature that the sampling need not be uniform but should overweight initial time instants, but no rigorous explanation was provided for this choice. In the present work we take some prototypical examples and, under standard hypothesis concerning the neural network convergence, we show that the optimal time sampling follows a (truncated) exponential distribution. In particular we explain when is best to use uniform time sampling and when one should not. The findings are illustrated with numerical examples on linear equation, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz system.</description>

      <title>Better Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers by Combining the Unitary Block Optimization Scheme with Classical Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nonreflecting Boundary Condition for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation for hyperrectangular computational domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the efficient ways of implementing the transparent boundary condition (TBC) and its various approximations for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation on a hyperrectangular computational domain in $\field{R}^d$ with periodic boundary conditions along the $(d-1)$ unbounded directions. In particular, we consider Pad\'e approximant based rational approximation of the exact TBC and a spatially local form of the exact TBC obtained under its high-frequency approximation. For the spatial discretization, we use a Legendre-Galerkin spectral method with a boundary-adapted basis to ensure the bandedness of the resulting linear system. Temporal discretization is then addressed with two one-step methods, namely, the backward-differentiation formula of order 1 (BDF1) and the trapezoidal rule (TR). Finally, several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods where we study the stability and convergence behaviour empirically.</description>
