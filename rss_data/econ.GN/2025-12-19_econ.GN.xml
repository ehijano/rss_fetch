      <title>Are the Bank of Korea's Inflation Forecasts Biased Toward the Target?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bank of Korea (BoK) regularly publishes the Economic Outlook, offering forecasts for key macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates. This study examines whether the BoK's inflation forecasts exhibit bias, specifically a tendency to align with its inflation target. We extend the Holden and Peel (1990) test to incorporate state-dependency, defining the state of the economy based on whether realized inflation falls below the target at the time of the forecast. Our analysis reveals that the BoK's inflation forecasts are biased under this state-dependent framework. Furthermore, we examine a range of bias correction strategies based on AR(1) and mean error models, including their state-dependent variants. These strategies generally improve forecast accuracy. Among them, the AR(1)-based correction exhibits relatively stable performance, consistently reducing the root mean square error.</description>

      <title>Migrants as First Responders: A Global Estimate of Disaster-Driven Remittances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: International remittances represent a vital source of disaster adaptation finance for households around the world, yet their responsiveness to environmental disasters remains poorly quantified. We reveal a previously unmeasured global macro-financial system of international migrant diasporas remittances response to the occurrence of disasters in the country of origin. We do so by developing a structural model simulating individual remittance decisions, calibrated with global disaster records and bilateral monthly remittances flow data from the period 2010-2019. Our analysis reveals that approximately 332 billion USD (5.46\% of total remittances) were mobilized specifically in response to earthquakes, floods, storms, and droughts over the decade. Earthquakes triggered the largest remittance responses per person affected, while droughts elicited the smallest. The model also identifies significant variation in diaspora groups' capacity to activate financial support. These findings establish remittances as a substantial yet limited form of disaster finance, highlighting their importance and limitations in building resilience against future environmental shocks.</description>

      <title>Did a feedback mechanism between propositional and prescriptive knowledge create modern growth?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What was the origin of modern economic growth? Joel Mokyr has argued that self-sustained modern economic growth originated from a feedback loop between propositional (theoretical) and prescriptive (applied) knowledge, which turned positive in the eighteenth century during the "Industrial Enlightenment". While influential, this thesis has never been directly tested. This paper provides the first quantitative evidence by estimating the impact of knowledge spillovers between propositional and prescriptive knowledge on innovation in England, 1600-1800. For this, it introduces two new text-based measures for 1) the innovativeness of publications and 2) knowledge spillovers. The paper finds strong evidence that a feedback loop between propositional and prescriptive knowledge became positive during the second half of the eighteenth century. It also documents that this process had positive effects on the real economy as measured through patents. Overall, the findings provide empirical support for Mokyr's original hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Veblen effects and broken windows in an environmental OLG model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can constantly comparing ourselves to others lead to overconsumption, ultimately increasing the ecological footprint? How do social comparisons shape green preferences over time? To answer these questions, we develop an environmental Overlapping Generations (OLG) model that explicitly accounts for Veblen effects and allows green preferences to be updated asynchronously, influenced by past environmental conditions and relative status considerations. We show that, along the optimal path, positional spending leads to overconsumption, which is detrimental to the environment. Taxing consumption is counterproductive as it does not directly address the social comparisons issue, leaving the problem unchanged. When the Veblenian mechanism is weak, the introduction of a materialistic ``secular trend'' -- that lowers the importance placed on the public good -- gives rise to two stable equilibria separated by a saddle: one in which agents care about environmental quality as much as consuming, and the other in which they derive utility solely from the latter. Studying the basins of attraction reveals that green investments are highly fragile. Our numerical experiments further indicated that, when Veblen effects are strong, the model depicts endogenous, persistent, aperiodic oscillations. In this case, green preferences fluctuate close to zero, and environmental quality is very low. Taken together, these findings suggest environmental vulnerability grows in parallel with status-driven consumption.</description>

      <title>Smart Data Portfolios: A Quantitative Framework for Input Governance in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing concerns about fairness, privacy, robustness, and transparency have made it a central expectation of AI governance that automated decisions be explainable by institutions and intelligible to affected parties. We introduce the Smart Data Portfolio (SDP) framework, which treats data categories as productive but risk-bearing assets, formalizing input governance as an information-risk trade-off. Within this framework, we define two portfolio-level quantities, Informational Return and Governance-Adjusted Risk, whose interaction characterizes data mixtures and generates a Governance-Efficient Frontier. Regulators shape this frontier through risk caps, admissible categories, and weight bands that translate fairness, privacy, robustness, and provenance requirements into measurable constraints on data allocation while preserving model flexibility. A telecommunications illustration shows how different AI services require distinct portfolios within a common governance structure. The framework offers a familiar portfolio logic as an input-level explanation layer suited to the large-scale deployment of AI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence on the effectiveness of retraining U.S. unemployed workers primarily comes from evaluations of training programs, which represent one narrow avenue for skill acquisition. We use high-quality records from Ohio and a matching method to estimate the effects of retraining, broadly defined as enrollment in postsecondary institutions. Our simple method bridges two strands of the dynamic treatment effect literature that estimate the treatment-now-versus-later and treatment-versus-no-treatment effects. We find that enrollees experience earnings gains of six percent three to four years after enrolling, after depressed earnings during the first two years. The earnings effects are driven by industry-switchers, particularly to healthcare.</description>

      <title>Tracks to Modernity: Railroads, Growth, and Social Movements in Denmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine how railway expansion shaped Denmark's nineteenth-century economic transformation and the diffusion of civic engagement in the form of Grundtvigian institutions. Using a new parish-level panel (1,589 parishes) and a difference-in-differences design that accounts for staggered adoption, we find that railroad connection increased local population by about 7 percent, driven in part by higher internal in-migration (roughly 10 percent), and accelerated structural change (manufacturing employment rises by about 1.8 percentage points and the non-agricultural share by about 2 percentage points). Rail access also increased the probability that a parish hosted a folk high school by about 1.7 percentage points and raised the local densities of both folk high schools and community houses. Overall, the results suggest that market access was not only a driver of economic modernization but also a catalyst for institutional and cultural transformation.</description>

      <title>Valuing Time in Silicon: Can Large Language Models Replicate Human Value of Travel Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a key advancement in artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) are set to transform transportation systems. While LLMs offer the potential to simulate human travelers in future mixed-autonomy transportation systems, their behavioral fidelity in complex scenarios remains largely unconfirmed by existing research. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the value of travel time (VOT) of three popular LLMs. We employ a full factorial experimental design to systematically examine LLMs' sensitivities to various transportation contexts, including the choice setting, travel purpose, and socio-demographic factors. Our results reveal a high degree of behavioral similarity between LLMs and humans. Some LLMs exhibit an aggregate VOT similar to that of humans, and all tested models demonstrate human-like sensitivity to travel purpose, income, and the time-cost trade-off ratios of the alternatives. Furthermore, the behavioral patterns of LLMs are highly consistent across varied contexts. However, while the behavior of every single model is highly robust, we also find some heterogeneity across models regarding the magnitude and direction of sensitivity to travel contexts and income elasticity. Overall, this study provides a foundational benchmark for the future development of LLMs as proxies for human travelers, demonstrating their robust decision-making capabilities while cautioning that misaligned magnitudes of economic trade-offs between humans and LLMs necessitate rigorous validation and additional conditioning of LLMs before their application.</description>

      <title>Measuring economic outlook in the news</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a resource-efficient methodology for measuring economic outlook in news text that combines document embeddings with synthetic training data generated by large language models. Applied to 27 million news articles, the resulting indicator significantly improves GDP growth forecast accuracy and captures sentiment shifts weeks before official releases, proving particularly valuable during crises. The indicator outperforms both survey-based benchmarks and traditional dictionary methods and is interpretable, allowing identification of specific drivers of economic sentiment. Our approach addresses key institutional constraints: it performs sentiment classification locally, enabling analysis of proprietary news content without transmission to external services while requiring minimal computational resources compared to direct LLM classification. The methodology generalizes to other countries and restricted data environments.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Natural Disasters on Food Security in Turkiye</title>

  Food security refers to people's access to enough safe nutritious food in order to be able to lead a healthy active life. It also involves elements such as food availability and affordability, as well as people being able to access food that can be consumed healthily. Natural disasters, however, can seriously threaten food security. Disasters' effects on food security are especially more evident in countries such as Turkiye that are frequently exposed to natural disasters due to their geologic and geographical structure. For this reason, the study investigates the effects of natural disasters on food security in Turkiye. The research first creates the Food Security Index in order to estimate the effects of natural disasters on food security. The next phase follows the process of econometric analysis, which consists of three steps. Step one of the econometric analysis uses unit root tests to check the stationarity levels of the series. The second step uses the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test to examine the long-term relationship between natural disasters and food security. The third and final step estimates the effects of natural disasters on food security. According to the obtained results, the study shows earthquakes, storms, and floods to have a significant short- as well as long-term negative effect on food security. The overall impact of natural disasters on food security has also been determined to be negative.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Portfolio Optimization with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid-quantum classical optimization has emerged as a promising direction for addressing financial decision problems under current quantum hardware constraints. In this work we present a practical end-to-end portfolio optimization pipeline that combines (i) a continuous mean-variance and Sharpe-ratio formulation, (ii) a QUBO/CQM-based discrete asset selection stage solved using D-Wave's hybrid quantum annealing solver, (iii) classical convex optimization for computing optimal asset weights, and (iv) a quarterly rebalancing mechanism. Rather than claiming quantum advantage, our goal is to evaluate the feasibility and integration of these components within a deployable financial workflow. We empirically compare our hybrid pipeline against a fund manager in real time and indexes used in Indian stock market. The results indicate that the proposed framework can construct diversified portfolios and achieve competitive returns. We also report computational considerations and scalability observations drawn from the hybrid solver behaviour. While the experiments are limited to moderate sized portfolios dictated by current annealing hardware and QUBO embedding constraints, the study illustrates how quantum assisted selection and classical allocation can be combined coherently in a real-world setting. This work emphasizes methodological reproducibility and practical applicability, and aims to serve as a step toward larger-scale financial optimization workflows as quantum annealers continue to mature.</description>
