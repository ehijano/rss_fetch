      <title>Nowcasting the euro area with social media data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a state-of-the-art large language model, we extract forward-looking and context-sensitive signals related to inflation and unemployment in the euro area from millions of Reddit submissions and comments. We develop daily indicators that incorporate, in addition to posts, the social interaction among users. Our empirical results show consistent gains in out-of-sample nowcasting accuracy relative to daily newspaper sentiment and financial variables, especially in unusual times such as the (post-)COVID-19 period. We conclude that the application of AI tools to the analysis of social media, specifically Reddit, provides useful signals about inflation and unemployment in Europe at daily frequency and constitutes a useful addition to the toolkit available to economic forecasters and nowcasters.</description>

      <title>Inference on panel data models with a generalized factor structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider identification, inference and validation of linear panel data models when both factors and factor loadings are accounted for by a nonparametric function. This general specification encompasses rather popular models such as the two-way fixed effects and the interactive fixed effects ones. By applying a conditional mean independence assumption between unobserved heterogeneity and the covariates, we obtain consistent estimators of the parameters of interest at the optimal rate of convergence, for fixed and large $T$. We also provide a specification test for the modeling assumption based on the methodology of conditional moment tests and nonparametric estimation techniques. Using degenerate and nondegenerate theories of U-statistics we show its convergence and asymptotic distribution under the null, and that it diverges under the alternative at a rate arbitrarily close to $\sqrt{NT}$. Finite sample inference is based on bootstrap. Simulations reveal an excellent performance of our methods and an empirical application is conducted.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of QMLE for dynamic panel data models with interactive effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of efficient estimation of panel data models in the presence of an increasing number of incidental parameters. We formulate the dynamic panel as a simultaneous equations system, and derive the efficiency bound under the normality assumption. We then show that the Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) applied to the system achieves the normality efficiency bound without the normality assumption. Comparison of QMLE with the fixed effects approach is made.</description>

      <title>Conditional Triple Difference-in-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triple difference-in-differences designs are widely used to estimate causal effects in empirical work. Surveying the literature, we find that most applications include controls. We show that this standard practice is generally biased for the target causal estimand when covariate distributions differ across groups. To address this, we propose identifying a causal estimand by fixing the covariate distribution to that of one group. We then develop a double-robust estimator and illustrate its application in a canonical policy setting.</description>

      <title>Finite Population Identification and Design-Based Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for quantifying uncertainty in finite populations, by using design distributions to calibrate sensitivity parameters in finite population identified sets. This yields uncertainty intervals that can be interpreted as identified sets, Bayesian credible sets, or frequentist design-based confidence sets. We focus on quantifying uncertainty about the average treatment effect (ATE) due to missing potential outcomes in a randomized experiment, where our approach (1) yields design-based confidence intervals for ATE which allow for heterogeneous treatment effects but do not rely on asymptotics, (2) provides a new motivation for examining covariate balance, and (3) gives a new formal analysis of the role of randomized treatment assignment. We illustrate our approach in three empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Statistical significance in choice modelling: computation, usage and reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers a commentary on the use of notions of statistical significance in choice modelling. We argue that, as in many other areas of science, there is an over-reliance on 95% confidence levels, and misunderstandings of the meaning of significance. We also observe a lack of precision in the reporting of measures of uncertainty in many studies, especially when using p-values and even more so with star measures. The paper provides a precise discussion on the computation of measures of uncertainty and confidence intervals, discusses the use of statistical tests, and also stresses the importance of considering behavioural or policy significance in addition to statistical significance.</description>
