      <title>Consciousness in a Higher Categorical Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two representations of the Segal category $\mathcal{X}$ modeling natural phenomena, the first one being based on the concept of micro-reversibility, producing a long sequence $\Sigma$ of categories as a resolution of $\mathcal{X}$, the second one providing graded categories cofibered in groupoids over the categories of $\Sigma$, using the concept of consciousness as impetus. We show those two representations are dual to each other.</description>

      <title>Path Types in Algebraic Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach to the semantics of identity types in intensional Martin-L\"of type theory is proposed, assuming only a category with finite limits and an interval. The specification of \emph{extensional} identity types in the original presentation of natural models paralleled that of the other type formers $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$, but the treatment of the \emph{intensional} case there was less uniform. It was later reformulated to an account based on polynomials; here a further improvement in the style of the other type formers is achieved by employing an interval, in order to give a single pullback specification of a model with \emph{path types}. The interval is also used to specify a (Hurewicz) fibration structure on the universe of the model. It is shown that the combination of these two conditions suffices to model the intensional identity rules, assuming only finite limits. The addition of an interval also relates the current treatment to that of cubical type theory.</description>

      <title>A categorical perspective on extended metric-topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the analysis and geometry of metric-measure structures in infinite dimensions, we study the category of extended metric-topological spaces, along with many of its distinguished subcategories (such as the one of compact spaces). One of the main achievements is the proof of the bicompleteness (i.e. of the existence of all small limits and colimits) of the aforementioned categories.</description>

      <title>Double Categorical Approaches to AQFT I: Axiomatic Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In operator-algebraic AQFT one routinely moves back and forth between two kinds of structure: inclusions of local algebras coming from inclusions of regions, and bimodules/intertwiners that implement the standard $L^2$-based constructions used to compare and compose observables. The obstruction to making this interplay genuinely functorial is that there are two independent compositions (restriction along inclusions and fusion/transport along bimodules) and they must be compatible on commuting spacetime diagrams, which is exactly the situation a double category is designed to encode. Part I resolves this by building a spacetime double category and a von Neumann algebra double category inspired by previous work by Orendain, and by packaging an AQFT input as a pseudo double functor whose vertical part is the Haag-Kastler net and whose squares record the required compatibilities in a well-typed way forced by commutativity. We formulate the Haag-Kastler axioms in this setup, establish the coherence needed for the construction, and work out representative examples.</description>

      <title>Commutation of Smyth and Hoare Power Constructions in Well-filtered Dcpos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior work [11] established a commutativity result for the Hoare power construction and a modified version of the Smyth power construction consisting of strongly compact sets, which is defined for Us-admitting dcpos, where Us-admissability is well-filteredness with compact sets replaced by strongly compact sets. In this paper, we consider the Hoare power construction H and the Smyth power construction Q on the category WF of well-filtered dcpos with Scott-continuous maps. Actually, the functors H and Q can be extended to monads. We prove that H and Q commute, that is, HQ(L) is isomorphic to QH(L) for a well-filtered dcpo L, if and only if L satisfies a property similar to consonance that we call (KC) and the Scott topology coincides with the upper Vietoris topology on Q(L). We also investigate the Eilenberg-Moore category of the monad composed by H and Q under a distributive law on WF and characterize it to be a subcategory of the category Frm, which is composed of all frames and all frame homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Nondeterministic Behaviours in Double Categorical Systems Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we build double theories capturing the idea of nondeterministic behaviors and trajectories. Following Libkind and Myers' Double Operadic Theory of Systems, we construct monoidal semi double categories of interfaces, along with what we call semimodules of systems, in the case of Moore machines, working with Markov categories with conditionals to handle nondeterminism. We use conditional products in these Markov categories to define trajectories in a compositional way, and represent nondeterministic systems using Markov maps; channels between systems are assumed to be deterministic.</description>

      <title>The B\'enabou-Roubaud theorem via string diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete proof of the B\'enabou-Roubaud monadic descent theorem using the graphical calculus of string diagrams. Our proof links the monadic and Grothendieck's original viewpoint on descent via an internal-category-based characterization of the category of descent data, equivalent to the one of Janelidze and Tholen.</description>

      <title>Hereditarily indecomposable continua as generic mathematical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the pseudo-arc as well as P-adic pseudo-solenoids (for a set of primes P) as generic structures, arising from a natural game in which two players alternate in building an inverse sequence of surjections. The second player wins if the limit of this sequence is homeomorphic to a concrete (fixed in advance) space, called generic whenever the second player has a winning strategy.
  For this purpose, we develop a new robust approximate Fra\"iss\'e theory in the context of MU-categories, a generalization of metric-enriched categories, suitable for working directly with continuous maps between metrizable compacta. Our framework extends both the classical and projective Fra\"iss\'e theories.
  We reprove the Fra\"iss\'e-theoretic characterization of the pseudo-arc and we realize every P-adic pseudo-solenoid as a Fra\"iss\'e limit of a suitable category of continuous surjections on the circle. Moreover, we show that, when playing the game with continuous surjections between non-degenerate Peano continua, the pseudo-arc is always generic, while the universal pseudo-solenoid is generic over all surjections between circle-like continua. This gives a complete classification of generic continua over full non-trivial subcategories of connected polyhedra with continuous surjections.</description>

      <title>Defining extended TQFTs via handle attachments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a finite presentation of the cobordism symmetric monoidal bicategory of (smooth, oriented) closed manifolds, cobordisms and cobordisms with corners as an extension of the bicategory of closed manifolds, cobordisms and diffeomorphisms. The generators are the standard handle attachments, and the relations are handle cancellations and invariance under reversing the orientation of the attaching spheres.
  In other words, given a categorified TQFT and 2-morphisms associated to the standard handles satisfying our relations, we construct a once extended TQFT.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Crystalline Equivalence Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.</description>
