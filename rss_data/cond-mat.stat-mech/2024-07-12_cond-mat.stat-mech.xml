      <title>A tractable model of monitored fermions with conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study measurement-induced phases of free fermion systems with U(1) symmetry. Following a recent approach developed for Majorana chains, we derive a field theory description for the purity and bipartite entanglement at large space and time scales. We focus on a multi-flavor one-dimensional chain with random complex hoppings and continuous monitoring of the local fermion density. By means of the replica trick, and using the number of flavors as a large parameter controlling our approximations, we derive an effective field theory made up of a SU(N) non-linear sigma model (NL$\sigma$M) coupled to fluctuating hydrodynamics. Contrary to the case of non-interacting Majorana fermions, displaying no U(1) symmetry, we find that the bipartite entanglement entropy satisfies an area law for all monitoring rates, but with a nontrivial scaling of entanglement when the correlation length is large. We provide numerical evidence supporting our claims. We briefly show how imposing a reality condition on the hoppings can change the NL$\sigma$M and also discuss higher dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Diffusive Epidemic Process with Permanent Immunity in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the generalized diffusive epidemic process, which is a metapopulation model for an epidemic outbreak where a non-sedentary population of walkers can jump along lattice edges with diffusion rates $D_S$ or $D_I$ if they are susceptible or infected, respectively, and recovered individuals possess permanent immunity. Individuals can be contaminated with rate $\mu_c$ if they share the same lattice node with an infected individual and recover with rate $\mu_r$, being removed from the dynamics. Therefore, the model does not have the conservation of the active particles composed of susceptible and infected individuals. The reaction-diffusion dynamics are separated into two stages: (i) Brownian diffusion, where the particles can jump to neighboring nodes, and (ii) contamination and recovery reactions. The dynamics are mapped into a growing process by activating lattice nodes with successful contaminations where activated nodes are interpreted as infection sources. In all simulations, the epidemic starts with one infected individual in a lattice filled with susceptibles. Our results indicate a phase transition in the dynamic percolation universality class controlled by the population size, irrespective of diffusion rates $D_S$ and $D_I$ and a subexponential growth of the epidemics in the percolation threshold.</description>

      <title>Dynamical critical behavior of the two-dimensional three-state Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical critical behavior of the two-dimensional three-state Potts model with single spin-flip dynamics in equilibrium. We focus on the mean-squared deviation of the magnetization $M$ (MSD$_{M}$) as a function of time, as well as on the autocorrelation function of $M$. Our simulations reveal the existence of two crossover behaviors at times $\tau_1 \sim L^{z_1}$ and $\tau_2 \sim L^{z_2}$, separating three dynamical regimes. MSD$_{M}$ appears to shift from ordinary diffusion in the first regime, to anomalous diffusion in the second, and finally to be constant in the third regime. The magnetization autocorrelation function on the other hand is found to fluctuate between exponential decay, stretched-exponential decay, and then again exponential decay along these three regimes. This behavior is in agreement with the one reported recently for the two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 108}, 034118 (2023)], indicating that the existence of two dynamic critical exponents is not a peculiarity of the Ising model itself. A comparison of both MSD$_{M}$ and the magnetization's autocorrelation function suggests that within our numerical accuracy the exponents $z_1$ and $z_2$ are shared between the Ising and three-state Potts models at least for the particular case of single spin-flip dynamics studied here, even though their equilibrium universality classes are clearly distinct. Continuity of MSD$_{M}$ requires that $\alpha (z_2 - z_1) = \gamma/\nu - z_1$, in which $\alpha$ is the anomalous exponent in the intermediate regime. Since the ratio $\gamma/\nu$ is not shared between the two models, it follows that $\alpha$ is not shared either, an aspect well verified in our simulations. Finally, we also discuss the relevance of our main findings using another useful observable, namely the line magnetization $M_{l}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability for Foundations of Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Carath\'eodory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical distributions from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion in confining potentials: non-equilibrium distribution tails and optimal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At long times, a fractional Brownian particle in a confining external potential reaches a non-equilibrium (non-Boltzmann) steady state. Here we consider scale-invariant power-law potentials $V(x)\sim |x|^m$, where $m&gt;0$, and employ the optimal fluctuation method (OFM) to determine the large-$|x|$ tails of the steady-state probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(x)$ of the particle position. The calculations involve finding the optimal (that is, the most likely) path of the particle, which determines these tails, via a minimization of the exact action functional for this system, which has recently become available. Exploiting dynamical scale invariance of the model in conjunction with the OFM ansatz, we establish the large-$|x|$ tails of $\ln \mathcal{P}(x)$ up to a dimensionless factor $\alpha(H,m)$, where $0&lt;H&lt;1$ is the Hurst exponent. We determine $\alpha(H,m)$ analytically (i) in the limits of $H\to 0$ and $H\to 1$, and (ii) for $m=2$ and arbitrary $H$, corresponding to the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. Our results for the fOU process are in agreement with the previously known exact $\mathcal{P}(x)$ and autocovariance. The form of the tails of $\mathcal{P}(x)$ yields exact conditions, in terms of $H$ and $m$, for the particle confinement in the potential. For $H\neq 1/2$, the tails encode the non-equilibrium character of the steady state distribution, and we observe violation of time reversibility of the system except for $m=2$. To compute the optimal paths and the factor $\alpha(H,m)$ for arbitrary permissible $H$ and $m$, one needs to solve an (in general nonlinear) integro-differential equation. To this end we develop a specialized numerical iteration algorithm which accounts analytically for an intrinsic cusp singularity of the optimal paths for $H&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>General properties of the response function in a class of solvable non-equilibrium models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium response function $R_{ij}(t,t')$, namely the variation of the local magnetization $\langle S_i(t)\rangle$ on site $i$ at time $t$ as an effect of a perturbation applied at the earlier time $t'$ on site $j$, in a class of solvable spin models characterized by the vanishing of the so-called {\it asymmetry}. This class encompasses both systems brought out of equilibrium by the variation of a thermodynamic control parameter, as after a temperature quench, or intrinsically out of equilibrium models with violation of detailed balance. The one-dimensional Ising model and the voter model (on an arbitrary graph) are prototypical examples of these two situations which are used here as guiding examples. Defining the fluctuation-dissipation ratio $X_{ij}(t,t')=\beta R_{ij}/(\partial G_{ij}/\partial t')$, where $G_{ij}(t,t')=\langle S_i(t)S_j(t')\rangle$ is the spin-spin correlation function and $\beta$ is a parameter regulating the strength of the perturbation (corresponding to the inverse temperature when detailed balance holds), we show that, in the quite general case of a kinetics obeying dynamical scaling, on equal sites this quantity has a universal form$X_{ii}(t,t') = (t+t')/(2t)$, whereas $\lim _{t\to \infty}X_{ij}(t,t')=1/2$ for any $ij$ couple. The specific case of voter models with long-range interactions is thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of spin transport in the Haldane-Shastry chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use kinetic theory and the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to derive the hydrodynamics of spin transport in the Haldane-Shastry chain. We obtain analytical expressions for relaxation from weak-domain-wall initial conditions and corresponding predictions for the spin Drude weight. We corroborate the latter against an exact microscopic calculation at infinite temperature and Luttinger-liquid expectations at zero temperature. We further obtain an analytical expression for the long-wavelength dynamics of the longitudinal spin structure factor at all fillings and temperatures. We show that the latter interpolates between an empirically exact expression that we have found at infinite temperature and the long-wavelength limit of the Haldane-Zirnbauer formula at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Measuring multipartite quantum correlations by thermodynamic work extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations are at the core of quantum mechanics and play a crucial role in various fields. While bipartite quantum correlations have been extensively studied, multipartite quantum correlations in many-body systems remain elusive due to their complex structure. In particular, a primary challenge lies in the fact that the calculation of multipartite quantum correlation measure often requires exponential cost. In this work, we tackle this problem by adopting a thermodynamic approach; we introduce a measure of multipartite quantum correlations based on the difference in extractable thermodynamic work by global operations and local operations and classical communication (LOCC). This can be regarded as a multipartite generalization of the work deficit, which has attracted attention as a thermodynamic measure of bipartite quantum correlation. A distinguishing feature of the thermodynamic approach to multipartite quantum correlation is that we can compare the degree of quantum correlations with clear operational meaning. Importantly, we develop an efficient calculation method of the multipartite work deficit. This efficient method works for a special class of quantum many-body systems described by matrix product states (MPS), where the numerical cost is shown to be proportional to the system size, significantly reducing the exponential cost required for the direct calculations. We demonstrate this efficient method in the AKLT state and the cluster state, and analytically obtain the exact values of this measure. We further show that a quantum phase transition described by MPS is well captured by the multipartite work deficit. This shows that the multipartite work deficit does not only highlight the fundamental connection between multipartite quantum correlations and quantum thermodynamics, but also serves as an efficiently-computable probe of the structures of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Analytic framework for self-dual criticality in $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the putative multicritical point in 2+1D $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge theory where the Higgs and confinement transitions meet. The presence of an $e$-$m$ duality symmetry at this critical point forces anyons with nontrivial braiding to close their gaps simultaneously, giving rise to a critical theory that mixes strong interactions with mutual statistics. An effective U(1) $\times$ U(1) gauge theory with a mutual Chern-Simons term at level $k$ is proposed to describe the vicinity of the multicritical point for $k \geq 4$. We argue analytically that monopoles are irrelevant in the IR CFT and compute the scaling dimensions of the leading duality-symmetric/anti-symmetric operators. In the large $k$ limit, these scaling dimensions approach $3 - \nu_{\rm XY}^{-1}$ as $1/k^2$, where $\nu_{\rm XY}$ is the correlation length exponent of the 3D XY model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <title>On the interplay of electronic and lattice screening on exciton binding in two-dimensional lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use path integral Monte Carlo to study the energetics of excitons in layered, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in order to elucidate the relative contributions of dielectric confinement and electron-phonon coupling. While the dielectric mismatch between polar perovskite layers and non-polar ligand layers significantly increases the exciton binding energy relative to their three dimensional bulk crystal counterparts, formation of exciton polarons attenuates this effect. Dielectric confinement is well described by a fractional dimension scaling law as a function of layer thickness. The contribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of the lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational theory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton binding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying isolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with ligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the excitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their photophysics.</description>

      <title>The trade-off between diagonal and off-diagonal elements in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to bypass the local measurement as an intermediate quantity in the proof of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), we have proposed a measurement-independent distinguishability measure. In this paper, we establish the connection between this measure and several other ETH measures in a more unified way. We first prove a universal trade-off relation for the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the measure. Then we extend it to the discussion of eigenstate typicality and the average observable. In the trade-off relationship, the exponential increase of off-diagonal elements will directly suppress the value of off-diagonal elements, and the diagonal elements will also be suppressed indirectly. This relationship gives another perspective to understand the physical mechanism behind ETH. Finally, by numerically calculating one-dimensional Ising spin chain, we examine several trade-off relationships and strong and weak ETH.</description>

      <title>Theory for the Anomalous Phase Behavior of Inertial Active Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to equilibrium systems, inertia can profoundly impact the phase behavior of active systems. This has been made particularly evident in recent years, with motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) exhibiting several intriguing dependencies on translational inertia. Here we report extensive simulations characterizing the phase behavior of inertial active matter and develop a mechanical theory for the complete phase diagram without appealing to equilibrium notions. Our theory qualitatively captures all aspects of liquid-gas coexistence, including the critical value of inertia above which MIPS ceases. Notably, our findings highlight that particle softness, and not inertia, is responsible for the MIPS reentrance effect at the center of a proposed active refrigeration cycle.</description>

      <title>An Equation of State for Turbulence in the Gross-Pitaevskii model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a far-from-equilibrium equation of state (EoS) in the Gross-Pitaevskii model. This universal dimensionless EoS is constructed by relating the turbulent cascade's scale-free spectrum amplitude to the energy flux of the steady state that emerges from the large-length-scale driving of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Remarkably, this EoS defies the generic predictions of wave-turbulent kinetic theory, even though the cascade spectra are quantitatively well understood within that theory. Finally, we find that the concept of quasi-static thermodynamic processes between equilibrium states extends to far-from-equilibrium steady states.</description>

However, in extreme or constrained conditions, the arrangement of water molecules deviates from conventional ice rules, resulting in properties significantly different from bulk water. In this study, we employ machine learning-driven first-principles simulations to identify a new stabilization mechanism in nanoconfined ice phases beyond conventional ice rules. Instead of forming four hydrogen bonds, nanoconfined crystalline ice can form a quasi-one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded structure that exhibits only two hydrogen bonds per water molecule. These structures consist of strongly hydrogen-bonded linear chains of water molecules that zig-zag along one dimension, stabilized by van der Waals interactions that stack these chains along the other dimension. The unusual interplay of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions in nanoconfined ice results in atypical proton behavior such as potential ferroelectric behavior, low dielectric response, and long-range proton dynamics.</description>

      <title>The SIS process on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs: determining the infected fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many methods to estimate the quasi-stationary infected fraction of the SIS process on (random) graphs. A challenge is to adequately incorporate correlations, which is especially important in sparse graphs. Methods typically are either significantly biased in sparse graphs, or computationally very demanding already for small network sizes. In this paper we present a new method to determine the infected fraction in sparse graphs, which we test on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Our method does take into account correlations and gives accurate predictions. At the same time, computations are very feasible and can easily be done even for large networks.</description>

      <title>An Insight of Heart-Like Systems with Percolation</title>

Abstract: We study the signal percolation through heart-like biological system. Starting from an initial distribution of waiting and inactive cells with probabilities $p$ and $(1-p)$ respectively, the signal propagation is observed in terms of active cells. As the signal enters the system from one end, the number of arrival of active sites at the other end is studied and analysis of the system behaviour is made by varying a few important parameters of the system like $p_{switch}$ (switching probability from inactive to waiting) and $p_{act}$ (switching probability from waiting to active). In this connection, the non-regular heart rhythms are discussed. Fraction of paths percolating through the system shows a transition from $0$ to $1$ near $p=p_c$. Some other important quantities like tortuosity and cluster distribution are discussed. Several critical exponents have been obtained and compared the exponents of standard percolation.</description>

      <title>Siegmund duality for physicists: a bridge between spatial and first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. This is known as Siegmund duality in mathematics. Here we show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Full Statistics of Regularized Local Energy Density in a Freely Expanding Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory and the Inverse Scattering Method to determine the full long-time statistics of the energy density $u(x,t)$ averaged over a given spatial interval, $$ U =\frac{1}{2L}\int_{-L}^{L}dx\, u(x,t)\,, $$ in a freely expanding Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) lattice gas on the line, following the release at $t=0$ of a finite amount of energy at the origin. In particular, we show that, as time $t$ goes to infinity at fixed $L$, the large deviation function of $U$ approaches a universal form when expressed in terms of the energy content of the interval $|x|&lt;L$ at time $t$. A key part of the solution is the determination of the most likely configuration of the energy density at time $t$, conditional on $U$.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and anomalies of conformal field theories in 1+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a relationship between conformally invariant boundary conditions and anomalies of conformal field theories (CFTs) in 1+1 dimensions. For a given CFT with a global symmetry, we consider symmetric gapping potentials which are relevant perturbations to the CFT. If a gapping potential is introduced only in a subregion of the system, it provides a certain boundary condition to the CFT. From this equivalence, if there exists a Cardy boundary state which is invariant under a symmetry, then the CFT can be gapped with a unique ground state by adding the corresponding gapping potential. This means that the symmetry of the CFT is anomaly free. Using this approach, we systematically deduce the anomaly-free conditions for various types of CFTs with several different symmetries. They include the free compact boson theory, Wess-Zumino-Witten models, and unitary minimal models. When the symmetry of the CFT is anomalous, it implies a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type ingappability of the system. Our results are consistent with, where available, known results in the literature. Moreover, we extend the discussion to other symmetries including spin groups and generalized time-reversal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Entropic distinguishability of quantum fields in phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general way of quantifying the entropic uncertainty of quantum field configurations in phase space in terms of entropic distinguishability with respect to the vacuum. Our approach is based on the functional Husimi $Q$-distribution and a suitably chosen relative entropy, which we show to be non-trivially bounded from above by the uncertainty principle. The resulting relative entropic uncertainty relation is as general as the concept of coherent states and thus holds for quantum fields of bosonic and fermionic type. Its simple form enables diverse applications, among which we present a complete characterization of the uncertainty surplus of arbitrary states in terms of the total particle number for a scalar field and the fermionic description of the Ising model. Moreover, we provide a quantitative interpretation of the role of the uncertainty principle for quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Irreversible Monte Carlo algorithms for hard disk glasses: from event-chain to collective swaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium sampling of the configuration space in disordered systems requires algorithms that bypass the glassy slowing down of the physical dynamics. Irreversible Monte Carlo algorithms breaking detailed balance successfully accelerate sampling in some systems. We first implement an irreversible event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a model of polydisperse hard disks. The effect of collective translational moves marginally affects the dynamics and results in a modest speedup that decreases with density. We then propose an irreversible algorithm performing collective particle swaps which outperforms all known Monte Carlo algorithms. We show that these collective swaps can also be used to prepare very dense jammed packings of disks.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation from lattice geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how isolated many-body quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation violate this hypothesis and cause nonthermal behavior. We demonstrate that Hilbert space fragmentation may arise from lattice geometry in a spin-1/2 model that conserves the number of domain walls. We generalize a known, one-dimensional, scarred model to larger dimensions and show that this model displays Hilbert space fragmentation on the Vicsek fractal lattice and the two-dimensional lattice. Using Monte Carlo methods, the model is characterized as strongly fragmented on the Vicsek fractal lattice when the number of domain walls is either small or close to the maximal value. On the two-dimensional lattice, the model is strongly fragmented when the density of domain walls is low and weakly fragmented when the density of domain walls is high. Furthermore, we show that the fragmentation persists at a finite density of domain walls in the thermodynamic limit for the Vicsek fractal lattice and the two-dimensional lattice. We also show that the model displays signatures similar to Hilbert space fragmentation on a section of the second-generation hexaflake fractal lattice and a modified two-dimensional lattice. We study the autocorrelation function of local observables and demonstrate that the model displays nonthermal dynamics.</description>
