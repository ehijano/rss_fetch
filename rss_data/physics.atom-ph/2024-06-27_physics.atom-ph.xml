      <title>Deciphering Core, Valence and Double-Core-Polarization Contributions to Parity Violating Amplitudes in $^{133}$Cs using Different Methods</title>

Abstract: This work examines the accuracy of different many-body methods for the calculations of parity violating electric dipole ($E1_{\text{PV}}$) amplitudes in atomic systems. In the last decade many different groups claim to achieve its accuracy below 0.5\%, for the $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s ~ ^2S_{1/2} $ transition in $^{133}$Cs atom. One of the major issues in these calculations is the opposite signs among the core correlation contribution from different works. To estimate $E1_{\text{PV}}$ of the above transition, various groups have used different many-body methods both in the linear response and sum-over-states approaches. By examining how these methods capture various electron correlation effects, we identify the underlying cause of sign discrepancies in the previously reported results. We also demonstrate how the double-core polarisation effects and scaled wave functions influence estimation of the $E1_{\text{PV}}$ amplitudes. The comprehensive discussions provided in this work will not only aid in our understanding on the potentials of the employed many-body methods but it will also serves as a road map for improving the $E1_{\text{PV}}$ calculation in the atomic systems further.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of a trapped atom interferometer with accelerating optical traps</title>

Abstract: In order to increase the measured phase of an atom interferometer and improve its sensitivity, researchers attempt to increase the enclosed space-time area using two methods: creating larger separations between the interferometer arms and having longer evolution times. However, increasing the evolution time reduces the bandwidth that can be sampled, whereas decreasing the evolution time worsens the sensitivity. In this paper, we attempt to address this by proposing a setup for high-bandwidth applications, with improved overall sensitivity. This is realized by accelerating and holding the atoms using optical dipole traps. We find that accelerations of up to $10^{3}$-$10^{5}$ m/s$^2$ can be achieved using acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) to move the traps. By comparing the sensitivity of our approach to acceleration as a baseline to traditional atom interferometry, we find a substantial improvement to the state of the art. In the limit of appropriate beam and optics stabilization, sensitivities approaching 10$^{-14}$ (m/s$^2$)/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ may be achievable at 1 Hz, while detection at 1 kHz with a sensitivity an order of magnitude better than traditional free-fall atom interferometers is possible with today's systems.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of negative group velocity</title>

Abstract: Distortion free negative group velocity pulse propagation is demonstrated in a rare-earth-ion-doped-crystal (RE) through the creation of a carefully designed spectral absorption structure in the inhomogeneous profile of Eu:YSO and subsequently inverting it. The properties of the RE system make it particularly well suited for this since it supports the creation of very sharp, arbitrarily tailored spectral features, which can be coherently inverted by a single pulse thanks to the long coherence time of the transition. All together these properties allow for a large time advancement of pulses without causing distortion. A pulse advancement of 10.9% with respect to the pulse full-width-half-maximum was achieved corresponding to a time-bandwidth product of 0.05. This to our knowledge is the largest time-bandwidth product achieved, with negligible shape distortion and attenuation. Our results show that the rare-earth platform is a powerful test bed for superluminal propagation in particular and dispersion profile programming in general</description>
