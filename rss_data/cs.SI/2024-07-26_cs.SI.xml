      <title>HC-GST: Heterophily-aware Distribution Consistency based Graph Self-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph self-training (GST), which selects and assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled nodes, is popular for tackling label sparsity in graphs. However, recent study on homophily graphs show that GST methods could introduce and amplify distribution shift between training and test nodes as they tend to assign pseudo-labels to nodes they are good at. As GNNs typically perform better on homophilic nodes, there could be potential shifts towards homophilic pseudo-nodes, which is underexplored. Our preliminary experiments on heterophilic graphs verify that these methods can cause shifts in homophily ratio distributions, leading to \textit{training bias} that improves performance on homophilic nodes while degrading it on heterophilic ones. Therefore, we study a novel problem of reducing homophily ratio distribution shifts during self-training on heterophilic graphs. A key challenge is the accurate calculation of homophily ratios and their distributions without extensive labeled data. To tackle them, we propose a novel Heterophily-aware Distribution Consistency-based Graph Self-Training (HC-GST) framework, which estimates homophily ratios using soft labels and optimizes a selection vector to align pseudo-nodes with the global homophily ratio distribution. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs show that HC-GST effectively reduces training bias and enhances self-training performance.</description>

      <title>Blockchain Takeovers in Web 3.0: An Empirical Study on the TRON-Steem Incident</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental goal of Web 3.0 is to establish a decentralized network and application ecosystem, thereby enabling users to retain control over their data while promoting value exchange. However, the recent Tron-Steem takeover incident poses a significant threat to this vision. In this paper, we present a thorough empirical analysis of the Tron-Steem takeover incident. By conducting a fine-grained reconstruction of the stake and election snapshots within the Steem blockchain, one of the most prominent social-oriented blockchains, we quantify the marked shifts in decentralization pre and post the takeover incident, highlighting the severe threat that blockchain network takeovers pose to the decentralization principle of Web 3.0. Moreover, by employing heuristic methods to identify anomalous voters and conducting clustering analyses on voter behaviors, we unveil the underlying mechanics of takeover strategies employed in the Tron-Steem incident and suggest potential mitigation strategies, which contribute to the enhanced resistance of Web 3.0 networks against similar threats in the future. We believe the insights gleaned from this research help illuminate the challenges imposed by blockchain network takeovers in the Web 3.0 era, suggest ways to foster the development of decentralized technologies and governance, as well as to enhance the protection of Web 3.0 user rights.</description>

      <title>Revealing urban area from mobile positioning data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers face the trade-off between publishing mobility data along with their papers while simultaneously protecting the privacy of the individuals. In addition to the fundamental anonymization process, other techniques, such as spatial discretization and, in certain cases, location concealing or complete removal, are applied to achieve these dual objectives. The primary research question is whether concealing the observation area is an adequate form of protection or whether human mobility patterns in urban areas are inherently revealing of location. The characteristics of the mobility data, such as the number of activity records or the number of unique users in a given spatial unit, reveal the silhouette of the urban landscape, which can be used to infer the identity of the city in question. It was demonstrated that even without disclosing the exact location, the patterns of human mobility can still reveal the urban area from which the data was collected. The presented locating method was tested on other cities using different open data sets and against coarser spatial discretization units. While publishing mobility data is essential for research, it was demonstrated that concealing the observation area is insufficient to prevent the identification of the urban area. Furthermore, using larger discretization units alone is an ineffective solution to the problem of the observation area re-identification. Instead of obscuring the observation area, noise should be added to the trajectories to prevent user identification.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Technological Future: A Topic, Sentiment, and Emotion Analysis in Social Media Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People worldwide are currently confronted with a number of technological challenges, which act as a potent source of uncertainty. The uncertainty arising from the volatility and unpredictability of technology (such as AI) and its potential consequences is widely discussed on social media. This study uses BERTopic modelling along with sentiment and emotion analysis on 1.5 million tweets from 2021 to 2023 to identify anticipated tech-driven futures and capture the emotions communicated by 400 key opinion leaders (KOLs). Findings indicate positive sentiment significantly outweighs negative, with a prevailing dominance of positive anticipatory emotions. Specifically, the 'Hope' score is approximately 10.33\% higher than the median 'Anxiety' score. KOLs emphasize 'Optimism' and benefits over 'Pessimism' and challenges. The study emphasizes the important role KOLs play in shaping future visions through anticipatory discourse and emotional tone during times of technological uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Instagram versus women of color: Why are women of color protesting Instagram's algorithmic changes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instagram has been appropriated by communities for several contemporary social struggles, often translating into real world action. Likewise, women of color (WOC) have used it to protest, share information and support one another through its various affordances. However, Instagram is known to have frequent updates, and recently the updates have been more drastic. The newest update changed the recommendation algorithm such that it showed video-oriented content (reels) from unknown accounts over static media from a user's own network. Several marginalized communities, and especially WOC resisted this change and others that led to it. Due to the backlash, Instagram rolled back its changes. Drawing from past HCI work on digital platforms for marginalised communities, I propose a qualitative study informed by the open research strategy to understand why WOC are resisting these changes, and eventually provide implications for design that can help implement changes in a more inclusive manner.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Web of Disinformation: Exploring the Larger Context of State-Sponsored Influence Campaigns on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for connectivity and exchange of ideas; however, they also serve as fertile grounds for the dissemination of disinformation. Over the years, there has been a rise in state-sponsored campaigns aiming to spread disinformation and sway public opinion on sensitive topics through designated accounts, known as troll accounts. Past works on detecting accounts belonging to state-backed operations focus on a single campaign. While campaign-specific detection techniques are easier to build, there is no work done on developing systems that are campaign-agnostic and offer generalized detection of troll accounts unaffected by the biases of the specific campaign they belong to. In this paper, we identify several strategies adopted across different state actors and present a system that leverages them to detect accounts from previously unseen campaigns. We study 19 state-sponsored disinformation campaigns that took place on Twitter, originating from various countries. The strategies include sending automated messages through popular scheduling services, retweeting and sharing selective content and using fake versions of verified applications for pushing content. By translating these traits into a feature set, we build a machine learning-based classifier that can correctly identify up to 94% of accounts from unseen campaigns. Additionally, we run our system in the wild and find more accounts that could potentially belong to state-backed operations. We also present case studies to highlight the similarity between the accounts found by our system and those identified by Twitter.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Coarse-Grained Socioeconomic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven machine-learning approach for modeling space-time socioeconomic dynamics. Through coarse-graining fine-scale observations, our modeling framework simplifies these complex systems to a set of tractable mechanistic relationships -- in the form of ordinary differential equations -- while preserving critical system behaviors. This approach allows for expedited 'what if' studies and sensitivity analyses, essential for informed policy-making. Our findings, from a case study of Baltimore, MD, indicate that this machine learning-augmented coarse-grained model serves as a powerful instrument for deciphering the complex interactions between social factors, geography, and exogenous stressors, offering a valuable asset for system forecasting and resilience planning.</description>

      <title>Brand Network Booster: A new system for improving brand connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new decision support system offered for an in-depth analysis of semantic networks, which can provide insights for a better exploration of a brand's image and the improvement of its connectivity. In terms of network analysis, we show that this goal is achieved by solving an extended version of the Maximum Betweenness Improvement problem, which includes the possibility of considering adversarial nodes, constrained budgets, and weighted networks - where connectivity improvement can be obtained by adding links or increasing the weight of existing connections. Our contribution includes a new algorithmic framework and the integration of this framework into a software system called Brand Network Booster (BNB), which supports brand connectivity evaluation and improvement. We present this new system together with three case studies, and we also discuss its performance. Our tool and approach are valuable to both network scholars and in facilitating strategic decision-making processes for marketing and communication managers across various sectors, be it public or private.</description>

      <title>Predicting the structure of dynamic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many aspects of graphs have been studied in depth. However, forecasting the structure of a graph at future time steps incorporating unseen, new nodes and edges has not gained much attention. In this paper, we present such an approach. Using a time series of graphs, we forecast graphs at future time steps. We use time series forecasting methods to predict the node degree at future time points and combine these forecasts with flux balance analysis -- a linear programming method used in biochemistry -- to obtain the structure of future graphs. We evaluate this approach using synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate its utility and applicability.</description>

      <title>SLADE: Detecting Dynamic Anomalies in Edge Streams without Labels via Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To detect anomalies in real-world graphs, such as social, email, and financial networks, various approaches have been developed. While they typically assume static input graphs, most real-world graphs grow over time, naturally represented as edge streams. In this context, we aim to achieve three goals: (a) instantly detecting anomalies as they occur, (b) adapting to dynamically changing states, and (c) handling the scarcity of dynamic anomaly labels. In this paper, we propose SLADE (Self-supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection in Edge Streams) for rapid detection of dynamic anomalies in edge streams, without relying on labels. SLADE detects the shifts of nodes into abnormal states by observing deviations in their interaction patterns over time. To this end, it trains a deep neural network to perform two self-supervised tasks: (a) minimizing drift in node representations and (b) generating long-term interaction patterns from short-term ones. Failure in these tasks for a node signals its deviation from the norm. Notably, the neural network and tasks are carefully designed so that all required operations can be performed in constant time (w.r.t. the graph size) in response to each new edge in the input stream. In dynamic anomaly detection across four real-world datasets, SLADE outperforms nine competing methods, even those leveraging label supervision.</description>

      <title>Node-like as a Whole: Structure-aware Searching and Coarsening for Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have made remarkable achievements in graph-level tasks. However, most existing works regard graph structures as a form of guidance or bias for enhancing node representations, which focuses on node-central perspectives and lacks explicit representations of edges and structures. One natural question is, can we treat graph structures node-like as a whole to learn high-level features? Through experimental analysis, we explore the feasibility of this assumption. Based on our findings, we propose a novel multi-view graph representation learning model via structure-aware searching and coarsening (GRLsc) on GT architecture for graph classification. Specifically, we build three unique views, original, coarsening, and conversion, to learn a thorough structural representation. We compress loops and cliques via hierarchical heuristic graph coarsening and restrict them with well-designed constraints, which builds the coarsening view to learn high-level interactions between structures. We also introduce line graphs for edge embeddings and switch to edge-central perspective to construct the conversion view. Experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements of GRLsc over 28 baselines from various architectures.</description>
