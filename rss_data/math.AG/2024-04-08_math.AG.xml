      <title>An introduction to mixed Tate motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed Tate motives are central objects in the study of cohomology groups of algebraic varieties and their arithmetic invariants. They also play a crucial role in a wide variety of questions related to multiple zeta values and polylogarithms, algebraic K-theory, hyperbolic geometry, and particle physics among others. This survey article is an introduction to mixed Tate motives and their many facets. It was written for the proceedings of the Summer School on Motives and Arithmetic Groups held in Strasbourg in June 2022.</description>

      <title>Simplices osculating rational normal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of von Staudt states that if eight planes osculate a twisted cubic curve and we divide them into two groups of four, then the eight vertices of the corresponding tetrahedra lie on a twisted cubic curve. In the current paper, we give an alternative proof of this result using modern tools, and at the same time we prove the analogous result for rational normal curves in any projective space. This higher dimensional generalization was claimed without proof in a paper of H.S. White in 1921.</description>

      <title>On isomorphisms of ind-varieties of generalized flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ind-varieties of generalized flags have been studied for two decades. However, a precise statement of when two such ind-varieties, one or both being possibly ind-varieties of isotropic generalized flags, are isomorphic, has been missing in the literature. Using some recent results on the structure of ind-varieties of generalized flags, we establish a criterion for the existence of an isomorphism as above. Our result claims that, with only two exceptions, isomorphisms of ind-varieties of generalized flags are induced by isomorphisms of respective generalized flags. The exceptional isomorphisms correlate with a well-known result of A. Onishchik from 1963.</description>

      <title>Feigin-Odesskii brackets associated with Kodaira cycles and positroid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a link between open positroid varieties in the Grassmannians $G(k,n)$ and certain moduli spaces of complexes of vector bundles over Kodaira cycle $C^n$, using the shifted Poisson structure on the latter moduli spaces and relating them to the standard Poisson structure on $G(k,n)$. This link allows us to solve a classification problem for extensions of vector bundles over $C^n$. Based on this solution we further classify the symplectic leaves of all positroid varieties in $G(k,n)$ with respect to the standard Poisson structure. Moreover, we get an explicit description of the moduli stack of symplectic leaves of $G(k,n)$ with the standard Poisson structure as an open substack of the stack of vector bundles on $C^n$.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we relate the basepoint-freeness threshold of a polarized abelian variety, introduced by Jiang and Pareschi, with $k$-jet very ampleness. Then, we derive several applications of this fact, including a criterion for the $k$-very ampleness of Kummer varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a regular immersion of schemes $Z\to X$ and a cohomology theory of fs log schemes, we formulate the logarithmic Gysin sequence using the "logarithmic compactification" $(\mathrm{Bl}_Z X,E)$ instead of the open complement $X-Z$, where $E$ is the exceptional divisor. We show that all $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant cohomology theories produced from motivic spectra and various non $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant cohomology theories like Nygaard completed prismatic cohomology admit logarithmic Gysin sequences.</description>

      <title>Even-carry polynomials and cohomology of line bundles on the incidence correspondence in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cohomology groups of line bundles $\mathcal{L}$ on the \emph{incidence correspondence}, that is, a general hypersurface $X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ of degrees $(1,1)$. Whereas the characteristic $0$ situation is completely understood, the cohomology in characteristic $p$ depends in a mysterious way on the base-$p$ digits of the degrees $(d, e)$ of $\mathcal{L}$. Gao and Raicu (following Linyuan Liu) prove a recursive description of the cohomology for $n = 3$, which relates to Nim polynomials when $p = 2$. In this paper, we devise a suitable generalization of Nim polynomials, which we call \emph{even-carry polynomials,} by which we can solve the recurrence of Liu--Gao--Raicu to yield an explicit formula for the cohomology for $n = 3$ and general $p$. We also make some conjectures on the general form of the cohomology for general $n$ and $p$.</description>

      <title>Minimal hyperbolic polynomials and ranks of homogeneous cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The starting point of this paper is the computation of minimal hyperbolic polynomials of duals of cones arising from chordal sparsity patterns. From that, we investigate the relation between ranks of homogeneous cones and their minimal polynomials. Along the way, we answer in the negative a question posed in an earlier paper and show examples of homogeneous cones that cannot be realized as rank-one generated (ROG) hyperbolicity cones.</description>

      <title>Thin Simplices via Modular Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local $h^*$-polynomial is a natural invariant of a lattice polytope appearing in Ehrhart theory and Hodge theory. In this work, we study the question posed in [GKZ94] concerning the classification of lattice simplices with vanishing local $h^*$-polynomial. Such simplices are called thin. We relate this question to linear codes and hyperplane arrangements over finite rings. This allows us to obtain a complete classification of the $4$-dimensional thin simplices, extending the previously known results in dimensions up to $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety with a semisimple quantum cohomology. It is known that the blowup $\operatorname{Bl}_{\rm pt}(X)$ of $X$ at one point also has semisimple quantum cohomology. In particular, the monodromy group of the quantum cohomology of $\operatorname{Bl}_{\rm pt}(X)$ is a reflectiongroup. We found explicit formulas for certain generators of the monodromy group of the quantum cohomology of $\operatorname{Bl}_{\rm pt}(X)$ depending only on the geometry of the exceptional divisor.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers some algebraic surfaces that can deform to planar Zappatic stable surfaces with a unique singularity of type En. We prove that the Galois covers of these surfaces are all simply connected of general type, for n &gt;= 4, and we give a formula for Chern numbers of such Galois covers. As an application, we prove that such surfaces do not exist for n&gt;30. Furthermore, Kollar improves the result to n&gt;9 in Appendix 5.</description>

Abstract: We study the homotopy fixed points under the Frobenius endomorphism on the stable $\mathbb A^1$-homotopy category of schemes in characteristic $p&gt;0$ and prove a rigidity result for cellular objects in these categories after inverting $p$. As a consequence we determine the analogous fixed points on the $K$-theory of algebraically closed fields in positive characteristic. We also prove a rigidity result for the homotopy fixed points of the partial Frobenius pullback on motivic cohomology groups in weights at most $1$.</description>

Abstract: We give an alternative proof of Suslin's equi-dimensionalization moving lemma, using a different geometric construction. The new construction provides better control of the degrees of the polynomials used to define endomorphisms of schemes along which algebraic cycles are pulled back.
  When applied to algebraic cycles with modulus, the new degree bound improves an earlier result of Hiroyasu Miyazaki and the present author so that we do not need to take the limit over the thickenings of the given divisor anymore.</description>

      <title>On Mirror Symmetry and Irrationality of Zeta Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental object of study in mirror symmetry of $n$-dimensional Fano varieties is the A-side connection on small quantum cohomology. When the Picard rank is 1, the Borel transform relates the quantum differential operator of the Fano to the Picard-Fuchs operator of the mirror to the associated pencil of anticanonical Calabi-Yau $(n-1)$-folds on the Fano variety. Expanding on related work by W. Yang on the Beukers-Peters pencil of K3 surfaces associated with Ap\'ery's proof for the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$, for such operators we define holomorphic prepotentials, virtual Yukawa couplings, and virtual instanton numbers, analogous to the usual ingredients of Calabi-Yau mirror symmetry. We prove that when the underlying Calabi-Yau operator is modular, the virtual Yukawa coupling is a modular form of weight-$(n+1)$, with the holomorphic prepotential as an Eichler integral. We then analyze the quantum differential operators for modular pencils of K3 surfaces arising as Dolgachev-Nikulin-Pinkham mirrors for the anticanonical linear systems for the 17 deformation classes of Fano threefolds of Picard rank-1 classified by Iskovskikh from the perspective of Golyshev &amp; Zagier's proof of the Gamma conjecture for such Fanos, the natural setting of Yang's work. Here, the virtual instanton numbers are proven to be periodic integers with period equal to the level of the modular subgroup. Finally, we conjecture that the geometric nature of these virtual instanton numbers can be understood in terms of relative genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of the associated log Calabi-Yau pair from the Fano threefold and anticanonical K3.</description>

Abstract: We unfold the theta integrals defining the Kudla-Millson lift of genus 1 associated to even lattices of signature (b,2), where b&gt;2. This enables us to compute the Fourier expansion of such defining integrals and prove the injectivity of the Kudla-Millson lift. Although the latter result has been already proved by Bruinier, our new procedure has the advantage of paving the ground for a strategy to prove the injectivity of the lift also for the cases of general signature and of genus greater than 1.</description>

      <title>Random planar trees and the Jacobian conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic approach to the celebrated Jacobian conjecture, which states that any Keller map (i.e. any polynomial mapping $F\colon \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ whose Jacobian determinant is a nonzero constant) has a compositional inverse which is also a polynomial. The Jacobian conjecture may be formulated in terms of a problem involving labellings of rooted trees; we give a new probabilistic derivation of this formulation using multi-type branching processes. Thereafter, we develop a simple and novel approach to the Jacobian conjecture in terms of a problem involving shuffling subtrees of $d$-Catalan trees, i.e. planar $d$-ary trees. We also show that, if one can construct a certain Markov chain on large $d$-Catalan trees which updates its value by randomly shuffling certain nearby subtrees, and in such a way that the stationary distribution of this chain is uniform, then the Jacobian conjecture is true. Finally, we use the local limit theory of large random trees to show that the subtree shuffling conjecture is true in a certain asymptotic sense, and thereafter use our machinery to prove an approximate version of the Jacobian conjecture, stating that inverses of Keller maps have small power series coefficients for their high degree terms.</description>
