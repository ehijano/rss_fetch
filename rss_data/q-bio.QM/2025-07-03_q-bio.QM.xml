      <title>TubuleTracker: a high-fidelity shareware software to quantify angiogenesis architecture and maturity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker (6+/-2 s) (p&lt;0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count (manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node count (all p&lt;0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area, and circularity (all p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Transformer Models to Capture Multi-Scale Dynamics in Biomolecules by nano-GPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term biomolecular dynamics are critical for understanding key evolutionary transformations in molecular systems. However, capturing these processes requires extended simulation timescales that often exceed the practical limits of conventional models. To address this, shorter simulations, initialized with diverse perturbations, are commonly used to sample phase space and explore a wide range of behaviors. Recent advances have leveraged language models to infer long-term behavior from short trajectories, but methods such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are constrained to low-dimensional reaction coordinates, limiting their applicability to complex systems. In this work, we present nano-GPT, a novel deep learning model inspired by the GPT architecture, specifically designed to capture long-term dynamics in molecular systems with fine-grained conformational states and complex transitions. The model employs a two-pass training mechanism that incrementally replaces molecular dynamics (MD) tokens with model-generated predictions, effectively mitigating accumulation errors inherent in the training window. We validate nano-GPT on three distinct systems: a four-state model potential, the alanine dipeptide, a well-studied simple molecule, and the Fip35 WW domain, a complex biomolecular system. Our results show that nano-GPT effectively captures long-timescale dynamics by learning high-order dependencies through attention mechanism, offering a novel perspective for interpreting biomolecular processes.</description>

      <title>The Basic Reproduction Number for Petri Net Models: A Next-Generation Matrix Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic reproduction number (R_0) is an epidemiological metric that represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The methodology for calculating this metric is well-defined for numerous model types, including, most prominently, Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The basic reproduction number is used in disease modeling to predict the potential of an outbreak and the transmissibility of a disease, as well as by governments to inform public health interventions and resource allocation for controlling the spread of diseases. A Petri net (PN) is a directed bipartite graph where places, transitions, arcs, and the firing of the arcs determine the dynamic behavior of the system. Petri net models have been an increasingly used tool within the epidemiology community. However, a generalized method for calculating R_0 directly from PN models has not been established. Thus, in this paper, we present a general method for calculating R_0 for Petri nets. Additionally, we show how a computational method implementing the next-generation algorithm in ODE models can also be applied to Petri net models. We also provide multiple examples of how to use this approach to calculate 0 for various SIR-type Petri net models.</description>

      <title>A robust and versatile deep learning model for prediction of the arterial input function in dynamic small animal $\left[^{18}\text{F}\right]$FDG PET imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures, precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence, extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation. Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.</description>

      <title>Co-Enrichment of Proteins in Extracellular Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04051v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived secretions that mediate tissue homeostasis and intercellular communication through their diverse cargos, such as proteins. Distinct EV biogenesis pathways suggest specific association and co-enrichment of proteins sharing a biogenesis pathway, and non-association and co-depletion of proteins segregated into distinct pathways. Yet these associations elude conventional protein expression or co-expression measurements. Here, we propose and define pairwise protein co-enrichment (CoEn) to quantify whether a given protein is co-enriched or co-depleted with another protein relative to its overall expression. We measure CoEn, and differential CoEn (dCoEn) between a stimulus and a reference condition, of up to 240 protein pairs in EVs using antibody microarrays. We validate CoEn by modulating well-known EV biogenesis pathways, and find that dCoEn quantifies expected changes between perturbed and reference conditions while uncovering new ones; CoEn and dCoEn in three model cell lines and parental and organotropic breast cancer progeny cell lines reveals both preserved and variable CoEn that may warrant further studies. Collectively, our result suggest that CoEn reflects and illuminates cell physiology and EV biogenies, is readily measurable, and could further serve as quality control in EV biomanufacturing as well as underpin new EV biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Neural Graph Matching Improves Retrieval Augmented Generation in Molecular Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular machine learning has gained popularity with the advancements of geometric deep learning. In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph matching approaches.

      <title>Reliable algorithm selection for machine learning-guided design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for machine learning-guided design, or design algorithms, use machine learning-based predictions to propose novel objects with desired property values. Given a new design task -- for example, to design novel proteins with high binding affinity to a therapeutic target -- one must choose a design algorithm and specify any hyperparameters and predictive and/or generative models involved. How can these decisions be made such that the resulting designs are successful? This paper proposes a method for design algorithm selection, which aims to select design algorithms that will produce a distribution of design labels satisfying a user-specified success criterion -- for example, that at least ten percent of designs' labels exceed a threshold. It does so by combining designs' predicted property values with held-out labeled data to reliably forecast characteristics of the label distributions produced by different design algorithms, building upon techniques from prediction-powered inference. The method is guaranteed with high probability to return design algorithms that yield successful label distributions (or the null set if none exist), if the density ratios between the design and labeled data distributions are known. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness in simulated protein and RNA design tasks, in settings with either known or estimated density ratios.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Asymptotic Robustness in Biochemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems maintain stable internal states despite environmental fluctuations. Absolute concentration robustness (ACR) is a striking homeostatic phenomenon in which the steady-state concentration of a molecular species remains invariant to changes in total molecular supply. Although experimental studies have reported approximate-but not exact-robustness in steady-state concentrations, such behavior has often been attributed to exact ACR motifs perturbed by measurement noise or minor side reactions, rather than recognized as a structural property of the network itself. In this work, we highlight a previously underappreciated phenomenon, which we term asymptotic ACR (aACR): approximate robustness can emerge solely from the architecture of the reaction network, without requiring parameters being negligible or the presence of an exact ACR motif. We find that aACR is far more common than classical ACR, as demonstrated in systems such as the Escherichia coli EnvZ-OmpR system and MAPK signaling cascade. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that such ubiquity stems solely from network structure. Finally, we reveal a counterintuitive feature of aACR in systems with multiple conserved quantities, revealing subtle distinctions in how robustness manifests in complex biochemical networks.</description>
