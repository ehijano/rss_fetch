      <title>Quantum-information methods for quantum gravity laboratory-based tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory and general relativity are about one century old. At present, they are considered the best available explanations of physical reality, and they have been so far corroborated by all experiments realised so far. Nonetheless, the quest to unify them is still ongoing, with several yet untested proposals for a theory of quantum gravity. Here we review the nascent field of information-theoretic methods applied to designing tests of quantum gravity in the laboratory. This field emerges from the fruitful extension of quantum information theory methodologies beyond the domain of applicability of quantum theory itself, to cover gravity. We shall focus mainly on the detection of gravitational entanglement between two quantum probes, comparing this method with single-probe schemes. We shall review the experimental proposal that has originated this field, as well as its variants, their applications, and discuss their potential implications for the quantum theory of gravity. We shall also highlight the role of general information-theoretic principles in illuminating the search for quantum effects in gravity.</description>

      <title>Extreme events and power-law distributions from nonlinear quantum dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-law probability distributions are widely used to model extreme statistical events in complex systems, with applications to a vast array of natural phenomena ranging from earthquakes to stock market crashes to pandemics. We propose the emergence of power-law distributions as a generic feature of quantum systems with strong nonlinear dissipation. We introduce a prototypical family of quantum dynamical systems with nonlinear dissipation, and prove analytically the emergence of power-law tails in the steady state probability distribution for energy. The power law physically originates from the amplification of quantum noise, where the scale of the microscopic fluctuations grows with the energy of the system. Our model predicts a power-law regime with infinite mean energy, which manifests as extreme events and divergences in the measurement statistics. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of power-law distributions for a general class of nonlinear dynamics known as quantum Li\'enard systems. This phenomenon can be potentially harnessed to develop extreme photon sources for novel applications in light-matter interaction and sensing.</description>

      <title>Exact analytic toolbox for quantum dynamics with tunable noise strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework that allows for the exact analytic treatment of quantum dynamics subject to coherent noise. The noise is modeled via unitary evolution under a Hamiltonian drawn from a random-matrix ensemble for arbitrary Hilbert-space dimension $N$. While the methods we develop apply to generic such ensembles with a notion of rotation invariance, we focus largely on the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). Averaging over the ensemble of ''noisy'' Hamiltonians produces an effective quantum channel, the properties of which are analytically calculable and determined by the spectral form factors of the relevant ensemble. We compute spectral form factors of the GUE exactly for any finite $N$, along with the corresponding GUE quantum channel, and its variance. Key advantages of our approach include the ability to access exact analytic results for any $N$ and the ability to tune to the noise-free limit (in contrast, e.g., to the Haar ensemble), and analytic access to moments beyond the variance. We also highlight some unusual features of the GUE channel, including the nonmonotonicity of the coefficients of various operators as a function of noise strength and the failure to saturate the Haar-random limit, even with infinite noise strength.</description>

      <title>Code switching revisited: low-overhead magic state preparation using color codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to prepare a high-fidelity magic state on a 2D color code using a 3D color code. Our method modifies the known code switching protocol with (i) a transversal gate between the 2D and the 3D code and (ii) a judicious use of flag-based post-selection. We numerically demonstrate that these modifications lead to a significant improvement in the fidelity of the magic state. For instance, subjected to a uniform circuit-level noise of $10^{-3}$, our code switching protocol yields a magic state encoded in the distance-$3$ 2D color code with a logical infidelity of $4.6\times 10^{-5}\pm 1.6 \times 10^{-5}$ (quantified by an error-corrected logical state tomography) with a $84\%$ of acceptance rate. Used in conjunction with a more recently proposed post-selection approach, the infidelity improves to $5.1 \times 10^{-7}$ for the same code when extrapolating from the polynomial fits.</description>

      <title>Fiber Bundle Fault Tolerance of GKP Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multi-mode GKP (Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill) quantum error-correcting codes from a geometric perspective. First, we construct their moduli space as a quotient of groups and exhibit it as a fiber bundle over the moduli space of symplectically integral lattices. We then establish the Gottesman--Zhang conjecture for logical GKP Clifford operations, showing that all such gates arise from parallel transport with respect to a flat connection on this space. Specifically, non-trivial Clifford operations correspond to topologically non-contractible paths on the space of GKP codes, while logical identity operations correspond to contractible paths.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced transitions for interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effect of measurements on interacting fermionic systems with particle-number conservation, whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, is studied. We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified approach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations. Within this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model (NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce generating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly in the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM, we determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables. Crucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its symmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First, this leads to the "information-charge separation": charge cumulants get decoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the volume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$, the interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge cumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction, there are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions, for which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations using time-dependent variational principles for matrix product states, which, in particular, confirm the separation of information and charge as a hallmark of the delocalized phase.</description>

      <title>Toward hybrid quantum simulations with qubits and qumodes on trapped-ion platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of hybrid quantum computing using both discrete (qubit) and continuous (qumode) variables on trapped-ion platforms. Trapped-ion systems have demonstrated record one- and two-qubit gate fidelities and long qubit coherence times while qumodes, which can be represented by the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, have remained relatively unexplored for their use in computing. Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom. Using classical simulations, we study its real-time evolution and we develop a suitable variational quantum algorithm for the ground state preparation. Our results motivate further studies of hybrid quantum computing in this context, which may lead to direct applications in condensed matter and fundamental particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the lifetime and coherence time of Cu2O Rydberg excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg states of excitons are promising quantum objects to engineer giant nonlinearities in a solid-state system. For this purpose, a deeper understanding of the dynamics of Rydberg excitons and of their potential for coherent manipulation becomes important. We report experimental results where two-photon absorption is resonant with various Rydberg states of excitons in copper oxide and we detect their emission dynamics on a streak camera with sub-picosecond resolution. This technique enables the direct measurement of the Rydberg states lifetimes, which are in good agreement with the expected Rydberg scaling law. Moreover, we observe several intriguing dynamics including the presence of long-lived coherent oscillations. Finally, we independently measure the coherence time of the Rydberg states using a modified Michelson interferometer and find a good agreement with the coherent oscillations detected in the exciton emission dynamics. The lifetimes also reveal the absence of inhomogeneous broadening in the current high-precision spectroscopic data for the S series, which together with the presence of significant coherence time confirms the suitability of the system for coherent engineering.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the stationary state of bosonic open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values of observables in the stationary state of a (Markovian) bosonic open quantum system. Using a hierarchy of semi-definite relaxations, we obtain finer and finer upper and lower bounds to any expectation value of interest. The bounds are rigorous, robust to stationary state degeneracies, and numerically improve as the occupation number increases on the examples we considered. This makes it adapted to the simulation of stationary states of bosonic qubits and in particular dissipatively stabilized cat qubits.</description>

      <title>Foundation of statistical mechanics under even more experimentally realistic conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is one of the hottest research topic as an application of many physical devices because the device characteristics can be used directly in computing sequences. Quantum RC is also a promising candidate for application in small-number qubit systems. Here, we propose a quantum RC based on the spin qubit system that reflects the status of the spin qubits in experiments comprising a one-dimensional qubit array. Spin qubits are coupled via the Heisenberg interaction, and data sequences are inputted to one of the spin qubits via pulsed rotations. By introducing dissipation, we obtained a relatively good performance in the quantum RC.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Enhanced Neyman-Pearson Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) provides entanglement-enabled target-detection enhancement, despite operating in an entanglement-breaking environment. Existing experimental studies of QI have utilized a Bayesian approach, assuming that the target is equally likely to be present or absent before detection, to demonstrate an advantage over classical target detection. However, such a premise breaks down in practical operational scenarios in which the prior probability is unknown, thereby hindering QI's applicability to real-world target-detection scenarios. In this work, we adopt the Neyman-Pearson criterion in lieu of the error probability for equally likely target absence or presence as our figure of merit for QI. We demonstrate an unconditional quantum advantage over the optimal classical-illumination protocol as benchmarked by the receiver operating characteristic, which examines detection probability versus false-alarm probability without resorting to known prior probabilities. Our work represents a critical advancement in adapting quantum-enhanced sensing to practical operational settings.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure and transversal logic of quantum Reed-Muller codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing efficient and noise-tolerant quantum computation protocols generally begins with an understanding of quantum error-correcting codes and their native logical operations. The simplest class of native operations are transversal gates, which are naturally fault-tolerant. In this paper, we aim to characterize the transversal gates of quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes by exploiting the well-studied properties of their classical counterparts. We start our work by establishing a new geometric characterization of quantum RM codes via the Boolean hypercube and its associated subcube complex. More specifically, a set of stabilizer generators for a quantum RM code can be described via transversal $X$ and $Z$ operators acting on subcubes of particular dimensions. This characterization leads us to define subcube operators composed of single-qubit $\pi/2^k$ $Z$-rotations that act on subcubes of given dimensions. We first characterize the action of subcube operators on the code space: depending on the dimension of the subcube, these operators either (1) act as a logical identity on the code space, (2) implement non-trivial logic, or (3) rotate a state away from the code space. Second, and more remarkably, we uncover that the logic implemented by these operators corresponds to circuits of multi-controlled-$Z$ gates that have an explicit and simple combinatorial description. Overall, this suite of results yields a comprehensive understanding of a class of natural transversal operators for quantum RM codes.</description>

      <title>Thresholds for post-selected quantum error correction from statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify regimes where post-selection can be used scalably in quantum error correction (QEC) to improve performance. We use statistical mechanical models to analytically quantify the performance and thresholds of post-selected QEC, with a focus on the surface code. Based on the non-equilibrium magnetization of these models, we identify a simple heuristic technique for post-selection that does not require a decoder. Along with performance gains, this heuristic allows us to derive analytic expressions for post-selected conditional logical thresholds and abort thresholds of surface codes. We find that such post-selected QEC is characterised by four distinct thermodynamic phases, and detail the implications of this phase space for practical, scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable inhomogeneous fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 15 exactly solvable inhomogeneous (spinless) fermion systems on one-dimensional lattices are constructed explicitly based on the discrete orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, e.g. the Krawtchouk, Hahn, Racah, Meixner, $q$-Racah polynomials. The Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg equations are solved explicitly, as the entire set of the eigenvalues and eigenstates are known explicitly. The ground state two point correlation functions are derived explicitly. The multi point correlation functions are obtained by Wick's Theorem. Corresponding 15 exactly solvable XX spin systems are also displayed. They all have nearest neighbour interactions. The exact solvability of Schr\"odinger equation means that of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. This leads to 15 exactly solvable Birth and Death fermions and 15 Birth and Death spin models. These provide plenty of materials for calculating interesting quantities, e.g. entanglement entropy, etc.</description>

Abstract: Spin precession is a textbook example of dynamics of a quantum system that exactly mimics its classical counterpart. Here we challenge this view by certifying the quantumness of exotic states of a nuclear spin through its uniform precession. The key to this result is measuring the positivity, instead of the expectation value, of the $x$-projection of the precessing spin, and using a spin &gt; 1/2 qudit, that is not restricted to semi-classical spin coherent states. The experiment is performed on a single spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nucleus, implanted in a silicon nanoelectronic device, amenable to high-fidelity preparation, control, and projective single-shot readout. Using Schr\"odinger cat states and other bespoke states of the nucleus, we violate the classical bound by 19 standard deviations, proving that no classical probability distribution can explain the statistic of this spin precession, and highlighting our ability to prepare quantum resource states with high fidelity in a single atomic-scale qudit.</description>

      <title>Inequality constraints in variational quantum circuits with qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization is emerging as a prominent candidate for exploiting the capabilities of near-term quantum devices. Many application-relevant optimization tasks require the inclusion of inequality constraints, usually handled by enlarging the Hilbert space through the addition of slack variables. This approach, however, requires significant additional resources especially when considering multiple constraints. Here, we study an alternative direct implementation of these constraints within the QAOA algorithm, achieved using qudit-SUM gates, and compare it to the slack variable method generalized to qudits. We benchmark these approaches on three paradigmatic optimization problems. We find that the direct implementation of the inequality penalties vastly outperforms the slack variables method, especially when studying real-world inspired problems with many constraints. Within the direct penalty implementation, a linear energy penalty for unfeasible states outperforms other investigated functional forms, such as the canonical quadratic penalty. The proposed approach may thus be an enabling step for approaching realistic industry-scale and fundamental science problems with large numbers of inequality constraints.</description>

      <title>Efficient fiber-pigtailed source of indistinguishable single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots in microcavities are an excellent platform for the efficient generation of indistinguishable single photons. However, their use in a wide range of quantum technologies requires their controlled fabrication and integration in compact closed-cycle cryocoolers, with a key challenge being the efficient and stable extraction of the single photons into a single-mode fiber. Here we report on a novel method for fiber-pigtailing of deterministically fabricated single-photon sources. Our technique allows for nanometer-scale alignment accuracy between the source and a fiber, alignment that persists all the way from room temperature to 2.4 K. We demonstrate high performance of the device under near-resonant optical excitation with g$^{(2)}$(0) = 1.3 %, a photon indistinguishability of 97.5 % and a fibered brightness of 20.8 %. We show that the indistinguishability and single-photon rate are stable for over ten hours of continuous operation in a single cooldown. We further confirm that the device performance is not degraded by nine successive cooldown-warmup cycles.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model with long-range hopping on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance and accuracy of digital quantum algorithms for the study of static and dynamic properties of the fermionic Hubbard model at half-filling with next-nearest neighbour hopping terms. We provide quantum circuits to perform ground and excited states calculations, via the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Equation of Motion (qEOM) approach respectively, as well as product formulas decompositions for time evolution. We benchmark our approach on a chain with L=6 sites and periodic boundary conditions, computing the charge and spin gaps, the spectral function and spin-spin dynamic correlations. Our results for the ground state phase diagram are in qualitative agreement with known results in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we provide concrete scalings for the number of gates needed to implement our protocols on a qubit register with all-to-all connectivities and on a heavy hexagonal coupling map.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Self-Contained Quantum Refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in quantum thermodynamics is the exploration of inherent dimensional constraints in thermodynamic machines. In the context of two-level systems, the most compact refrigerator necessitates the involvement of three entities, operating under self-contained conditions that preclude the use of external work sources. Here, we build such a smallest refrigerator using a nuclear spin system, where three distinct two-level carbon-13 nuclei in the same molecule are involved to facilitate the refrigeration process. The self-contained feature enables it to operate without relying on net external work, and the unique mechanism sets this refrigerator apart from its classical counterparts. We evaluate its performance under varying conditions and systematically scrutinize the cooling constraints across a spectrum of scenarios, which sheds light on the interplay between quantum information and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Determination of Single-Impurity Anderson Model Using Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach on a Spin Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate determination of the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials using first principle methods is of paramount importance in condensed matter physics, computational chemistry, and material science. However, due to the exponential scaling of computational resources, incorporating such materials into classical computation frameworks becomes prohibitively expensive. In 2016, Bauer et al. proposed a hybrid quantum-classical approach to correlated materials Phys. Rev. X 6, 031045 (2016)}] that can efficiently tackle the electronic structure of complex correlated materials. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that approach to tackle the computational challenges associated with strongly correlated materials. By seamlessly integrating quantum computation into classical computers, we address the most computationally demanding aspect of the calculation, namely the computation of the Green's function, using a spin quantum processor. Furthermore, we realize a self-consistent determination of the single impurity Anderson model through a feedback loop between quantum and classical computations. A quantum phase transition in the Hubbard model from the metallic phase to the Mott insulator is observed as the strength of electron correlation increases. As the number of qubits with high control fidelity continues to grow, our experimental findings pave the way for solving even more complex models, such as strongly correlated crystalline materials or intricate molecules.</description>

      <title>Microwave-activated two-qubit gates for fixed-coupling and fixed-frequency transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-microwave control of fixed-frequency superconducting quantum systems offers the potential to reduce control circuit complexity and increase system coherence. Nevertheless, due to the limited control flexibility in qubit parameters, one has to address several issues, such as quantum crosstalk and frequency crowding, for scaling up qubit architecture with non-tunable elements. This study proposes a microwave-activated two-qubit gate scheme for two fixed-frequency transmon qubits coupled via a fixed-frequency transmon coupler. The protocol relies on applying a microwave pulse exclusively to the coupler, enabling the implementation of a controlled-Z (CZ) gate. We show that the gate fidelity exceeding 0.999 can be achieved within 150 ns, excluding decoherence effects. Moreover, we also show that leakage from the computational subspace to non-computational states can also be effectively suppressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametrized quantum circuits are essential components of variational quantum algorithms. Until now, optical implementations of these circuits have relied solely on adjustable linear optical units. In this study, we demonstrate that using programmable nonlinearities, rather than linear optics, offers a more efficient method for constructing quantum optical circuits -- especially quantum neural networks. This approach significantly reduces the number of adjustable parameters needed to achieve high-fidelity operation. Specifically, we explored a quantum optical neural network (QONN) architecture composed of meshes of two-mode interferometers programmable by adjustable Kerr-like nonlinearities. We assessed the capabilities of our quantum optical neural network architecture and compared its performance to previously studied architectures that use multimode linear optics units. Additionally, we suggest future research directions for improving programmable quantum optical circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for the Advection-Diffusion Equation with Optimal Success Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum algorithm for simulating multidimensional scalar transport problems using a time-marching strategy is presented. After discretization, the explicit time-marching operator is separated into an advection-like component and a corrective shift operator. The advection-like component is mapped to a Hamiltonian simulation problem and is combined with the shift operator through the linear combination of unitaries algorithm. The result is an unscaled block encoding of the time-marching operator with an optimal success probability without the need for amplitude amplification, thereby retaining a linear dependence on the simulation time. State-vector simulations of a scalar transported in a steady two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitNet, the first benchmark and test dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms in the form of quantum circuit codes. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally different and significantly more complicated due to highly flexible design space and intricate manipulation of qubits. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design task for Large Language Models. 2. Implementation for a wide range of quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, with easy extension to more quantum algorithms. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through primitive fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning, and LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns. QCircuitNet provides a comprehensive benchmark for AI-driven quantum algorithm design, offering advantages in model evaluation and improvement, while also revealing some limitations of LLMs in this domain.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Quantum Codes via the Coefficients in Knill-Laflamme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for protecting quantum information against noise, yet understanding the structure of the Knill-Laflamme (KL) coefficients $\lambda_{ij}$ from the condition $PE_i^\dagger E_j P = \lambda_{ij} P$ remains challenging, particularly for nonadditive codes. In this work, we introduce the signature vector $\vec{\lambda}(P)$, composed of the off-diagonal KL coefficients $\lambda_{ij}$, where each coefficient corresponds to equivalence classes of errors counted only once. We define its Euclidean norm $\lambda^*(P)$ as a scalar measure representing the total strength of error correlations within the code subspace defined by the projector $P$. We parameterize $P$ on a Stiefel manifold and formulate an optimization problem based on the KL conditions to systematically explore possible values of $\lambda^*$. Moreover, we show that, for $((n,K,d))$ codes, $\lambda^*$ is invariant under local unitary transformations. Applying our approach to the $((6, 2, 3))$ quantum code, we find that $\lambda^*_{\text{min}} = \sqrt{0.6}$ and $\lambda^*_{\text{max}} = 1$, with $\lambda^* = 1$ corresponding to a known degenerate stabilizer code. We construct continuous families of new nonadditive codes parameterized by vectors in $\mathbb{R}^5$, with $\lambda^*$ varying over the interval $[\sqrt{0.6}, 1]$. For the $((7, 2, 3))$ code, we identify $\lambda^*_{\text{min}} = 0$ (corresponding to the non-degenerate Steane code) and $\lambda^*_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{7}$ (corresponding to the permutation-invariant code by Pollatsek and Ruskai), and we demonstrate continuous paths connecting these extremes via cyclic codes characterized solely by $\lambda^*$. Our findings provide new insights into the structure of quantum codes, advance the theoretical foundations of QEC, and open new avenues for investigating intricate relationships between code subspaces and error correlations.</description>

      <title>Single-copy stabilizer testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of testing whether an unknown $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ is a stabilizer state, with only single-copy access. We give an algorithm solving this problem using $O(n)$ copies, and conversely prove that $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ copies are required for any algorithm. The main observation behind our algorithm is that when repeatedly measuring in a randomly chosen stabilizer basis, stabilizer states are the most likely among the set of all pure states to exhibit linear dependencies in measurement outcomes. Our algorithm is designed to probe deviations from this extremal behavior. For the lower bound, we first reduce stabilizer testing to the task of distinguishing random stabilizer states from the maximally mixed state. We then argue that, without loss of generality, it is sufficient to consider measurement strategies that a) lie in the commutant of the tensor action of the Clifford group and b) satisfy a Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) condition. By leveraging these constraints, together with novel results on the partial transposes of the generators of the Clifford commutant, we derive the lower bound on the sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Programmable Quantum Linear Interference with Pulse Shaping of Quantum Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for interfering frequency-multiplexed photonic quantum states without the use of optical nonlinear effects, and experimentally demonstrate this technique via frequency-domain Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference. By cascading the generation of quantum states onto arbitrary orthogonal modes, we can induce interference across any desired frequency mode. Following the generation of quantum states onto the frequency modes, performing measurements in independent frequency bands enables the realisation of a frequency-domain linear optical circuit analogous to linear interference in the spatial domain. We successfully demonstrated programmable quantum interference by controlling the spectral mode functions and measurement bases. Our method offers a new approach to harness the full potential of light's temporal-frequency degrees of freedom, providing a path towards scalable and programmable photonic quantum computing architectures without the need for optical nonlinearities or spatial-mode beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Beyond the semiclassical approximation in atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a quantum perturbative approach to evaluating the phase shift of an atom interferometer in a weakly anharmonic trap. This provides a simple way to evaluate quantum corrections to the standard semi-classical approximation. The calculation benefits from the use of generalized coherent states for a basis. We find that the form of the semi-classical approximation remains valid to first order in the anharmonic perturbation, but that phase differences arise because the trajectory of a quantum wave packet will generally deviate from that of a classical particle. In general, the quantum correction to the phase is a factor $a^2/A^2$ smaller than the semi-classical perturbation itself, where $a$ is the quantum harmonic oscillator length scale and $A$ is the classical amplitude of the motion.</description>

      <title>The Space Just Above One Clean Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the model of computation where we start with two halves of a $2n$-qubit maximally entangled state. We get to apply a universal quantum computation on one half, measure both halves at the end, and perform classical postprocessing. This model, which we call $\frac12$BQP, was defined in STOC 2017 [ABKM17] to capture the power of permutational computations on special input states. As observed in [ABKM17], this model can be viewed as a natural generalization of the one-clean-qubit model (DQC1) where we learn the content of a high entropy input state only after the computation is completed. An interesting open question is to characterize the power of this model, which seems to sit nontrivially between DQC1 and BQP. In this paper, we show that despite its limitations, this model can carry out many well-known quantum computations that are candidates for exponential speed-up over classical computations (and possibly DQC1). In particular, $\frac12$BQP can simulate Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial Time (IQP) and solve the Deutsch-Jozsa problem, Bernstein-Vazirani problem, Simon's problem, and period finding. As a consequence, $\frac12$BQP also solves Order Finding and Factoring outside of the oracle setting. Furthermore, $\frac12$BQP can solve Forrelation and the corresponding oracle problem given by Raz and Tal [RT22] to separate BQP and PH. We also study limitations of $\frac12$BQP and show that similarly to DQC1, $\frac12$BQP cannot distinguish between unitaries which are close in trace distance, then give an oracle separating $\frac12$BQP and BQP. Due to this limitation, $\frac12$BQP cannot obtain the quadratic speedup for unstructured search given by Grover's algorithm [Gro96]. We conjecture that $\frac12$BQP cannot solve $3$-Forrelation.</description>

      <title>Super-Robust Nonadiabatic Holonomic Quantum Computation in coherence-protected Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The schmeme of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) offers an error-resistant method for implementing quantum gates, capable of mitigating certain errors. However, the conventional NHQC schemes often entail longer operations concerning standard gate operations, making them more vulnerable to the effects of quantum decoherence. In this research, we propose an implementation of the Super-Robust NHQC scheme within the Decoherence-Free Subspace (DFS). SR-NHQC has demonstrated robustness against Global Control Errors (GCEs). By utilizing capacitance-coupled transmon qubits within a DFS, our approach enables universal gate operations on a scalable two-dimensional square lattice of superconducting qubits. Numerical simulations demonstrate the practicality of SR-NHQC in DFS, showcasing its superiority in mitigating GCEs and decoherence effects compared to conventional NHQC schemes. Our work presents a promising strategy for advancing the reliability of quantum computation in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Pseudorandomness from Hamiltonian Phase States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum pseudorandomness has found applications in many areas of quantum information, ranging from entanglement theory, to models of scrambling phenomena in chaotic quantum systems, and, more recently, in the foundations of quantum cryptography. Kretschmer (TQC '21) showed that both pseudorandom states and pseudorandom unitaries exist even in a world without classical one-way functions. To this day, however, all known constructions require classical cryptographic building blocks which are themselves synonymous with the existence of one-way functions, and which are also challenging to realize on realistic quantum hardware.
  In this work, we seek to make progress on both of these fronts simultaneously -- by decoupling quantum pseudorandomness from classical cryptography altogether. We introduce a quantum hardness assumption called the Hamiltonian Phase State (HPS) problem, which is the task of decoding output states of a random instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuit. Hamiltonian phase states can be generated very efficiently using only Hadamard gates, single-qubit Z-rotations and CNOT circuits. We show that the hardness of our problem reduces to a worst-case version of the problem, and we provide evidence that our assumption is plausibly fully quantum; meaning, it cannot be used to construct one-way functions. We also show information-theoretic hardness when only few copies of HPS are available by proving an approximate $t$-design property of our ensemble. Finally, we show that our HPS assumption and its variants allow us to efficiently construct many pseudorandom quantum primitives, ranging from pseudorandom states, to quantum pseudoentanglement, to pseudorandom unitaries, and even primitives such as public-key encryption with quantum keys.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Coherence Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence transformation is pivotal for quantum technologies, which cannot always be accomplished deterministically. We investigate the probabilistic coherence transformation under strictly incoherent operations. To this end, by virtue of majorization lattice, the greedy and thrifty protocols are adapted for the probabilistic coherence transformation, of which the latter exhibits certain superiority in preserving coherence on average. Intuitively, it is found that the large coherence gain can be realized with the price of success probability loss for coherence transformation, and vice versa. Deterministic and probabilistic coherence transformations between two mixed states are explored. As an application, it is shown that the conversion from coherence into entanglement may benefit from probabilistic coherence transformation.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits for digital quantum simulation of nonlocal electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the compelling need to understand the nonequilibrium dynamics of small-polaron formation following an electron-phonon interaction quench, in this work we propose a digital quantum simulator of a one-dimensional lattice model describing an itinerant fermionic excitation (e.g. an electron) nonlocally coupled to zero-dimensional bosons (e.g. Einstein-type phonons). Quantum circuits implementing the dynamics of this model, which includes Peierls- and breathing-mode-type excitation-boson interactions, are designed here, their complexity scaling linearly with the system size. A circuit that generates the natural initial (pre-quench) state of this system -- a bare-excitation Bloch state, equivalent to a $W$ state of a qubit register -- is also presented. To facilitate comparisons with the proposed simulator, once experimentally realized, the system dynamics are also evaluated numerically and characterized through the Loschmidt echo and various correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Optimality of meta-converse for channel simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of shared non-signaling correlations for the problem of simulating a channel using noiseless communication in the one-shot setting. For classical channels, we show how to round any non-signaling-assisted simulation strategy--which corresponds to the natural linear programming meta-converse for channel simulation--to a strategy that only uses shared randomness. For quantum channels, we round any non-signaling-assisted simulation strategy to a strategy that only uses shared entanglement. Our main result is for classical and classical-quantum channels, for which we employ ideas from approximation algorithms to give a guarantee on the ratio of success probabilities of at least $(1-\mathrm{e}^{-1})$. We further show this ratio to be optimal for the purely classical case. It can be improved to $(1-t^{-1})$ using $O(\ln \ln(t))$ additional bits of communication.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies for Winning Certain Coset-Guessing Quantum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recently introduced coset guessing game, Alice plays against Bob and Charlie, aiming to meet a joint winning condition. Bob and Charlie can only communicate before the game starts to devise a joint strategy. The game we consider begins with Alice preparing a 2m-qubit quantum state based on a random selection of three parameters. She sends the first m qubits to Bob and the rest to Charlie and then reveals to them her choice for one of the parameters. Bob is supposed to guess one of the hidden parameters, Charlie the other, and they win if both guesses are correct. From previous work, we know that the probability of Bob's and Charlie's guesses being simultaneously correct goes to zero exponentially as m increases. We derive a tight upper bound on this probability and show how Bob and Charlie can achieve it. While developing the optimal strategy, we devised an encoding circuit using only CNOT and Hadamard gates, which could be relevant for building efficient CSS-coded systems. We found that the role of quantum information that Alice communicates to Bob and Charlie is to make their responses correlated rather than improve their individual (marginal) correct guessing rates.</description>

      <title>Holographic View of Mixed-State Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological phases (mSPTs) and (d+1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological states (SSPTs). Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry $\mathcal{S}$ and global symmetry $\mathcal{G}$ corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong $\mathcal{S}$ and weak $\mathcal{G}$ symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted Renyi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs.</description>

      <title>Is animal magnetoreception quantum? A perspective from the energy resolution limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large number of magnetic sensors, like superconducting quantum interference devices, optical pumping and nitrogen vacancy magnetometers, were shown to satisfy the energy resolution limit. This limit states that the magnetic sensitivity of the sensor, when translated into a product of energy with time, is bounded below by Planck's constant, $\hbar$. This bound implies a fundamental limitation as to what can be achieved in magnetic sensing. Here we explore biological magnetometers, in particular three magnetoreception mechanisms thought to underly animals' geomagnetic field sensing: the radical-pair, the magnetite and the MagR mechanism. We address the question of how close these mechanisms approach the energy resolution limit. At the quantitative level, the utility of the energy resolution limit is that it informs the workings of magnetic sensing in model-independent ways, and thus can provide subtle consistency checks for theoretical models and estimated or measured parameter values, particularly needed in complex biological systems. At the qualitative level, the closer the energy resolution is to $\hbar$, the more \enquote{quantum} is the sensor. This offers an alternative route towards understanding the quantum biology of magnetoreception. It also quantifies the room for improvement, illuminating what Nature has achieved, and stimulating the engineering of biomimetic sensors exceeding Nature's magnetic sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the sensitivity of a temperature sensor based on germanium-vacancy color center (GeV) in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature sensors based on GeV color center in diamond are attracting a lot of attention in both science and industry. The industrial adoption of these sensors nevertheless, requires the simplest and cheapest possible design for the sensing element. The original sensor design was based on the measurement of the spectral characteristics of the zero-phonon line. Recently, a modification of this method has been proposed utilizing splitting the GeV emission with a dichroic mirror and determining on temperature from the ratio of two resulting signals. In this analysis, we compare both methods in detail. For measurements near room temperature, both methods have comparable behavior, slightly depended on quality of components used. However, for optimal parameters of a filter at temperatures of about 300 {\deg}C, the new method already outperforms the original by about a factor of 2. Moreover, the sensitivity of the new method remains approximately consistent with that observed at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle Universality of the Many-Body Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider systems of fermions evolved by non-interacting unitary circuits with correlated on-site potentials. When these potentials are drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular random matrix ensemble, the spectral form factor (SFF) of the resulting circuit ensemble can be computed exactly without numerical sampling. In the case of the circular unitary ensemble (CUE) we report an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for arbitrary system sizes, and show that it grows through a sequence of exponential ramps. Using exact numerical methods, we find that the circular orthogonal and symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively) also lead to exponential growth of the SFF. This exponential growth is characteristic of non-interacting systems with random matrix statistics at the $\textit{single-particle}$ level and, upon introducing interactions, crosses over to a linear ramp consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.</description>

      <title>Field theory of monitored, interacting fermion dynamics with charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-conserving dynamics of non-interacting fermions monitored by local charge measurements have been shown to possess in 1D space only an area-law-entangled phase, with no measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). This phenomenon was elegantly explained by an effective replica field theory given by a non-linear sigma model featuring large replica symmetries. In this work, we focus on the charge-conserving monitored dynamics of interacting fermions in 1D. Using a unifying replica Keldysh field theory, we show that more dynamical phases and transitions emerge owing to the reduction of replica symmetry when interactions are introduced. The reduced symmetry combines a discrete replica permutation symmetry and the charge-conservation within each replica. The former and its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT between area-law and volume-law entanglement scalings, which can be described by a separatrix in the weak-coupling renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge conservation dictates the Kosterlitz-Thouless type ``charge-sharpening" transition between the two kinds of dynamics where the global charge information is either hidden or reconstructible from the local measurements. All the relevant phases and transitions can be understood within the same unifying field theory. Additionally, this field theory provides insight into why the charge-sharpening transition should only happen in the presence of volume-law entanglement scaling. Moreover, we show that our field theory, despite being constructed using the Keldysh formalism, is equivalent to a statistical mechanics model that describes the (replicated) time-evolution of the system's density matrix mapped to a doubled Hilbert space under the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. This equivalence is the result of the trivialization of the fermion distribution function by measurement-induced heating effects.</description>

      <title>Emergent Fracton Hydrodynamics in the Fractional Quantum Hall Regime of Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of synthetic gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold atoms and the simulation of quantum Hall physics has witnessed remarkable experimental progress. Here, we establish key signatures of fractional quantum Hall systems in their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that in the lowest Landau level the system generically relaxes subdiffusively. The slow relaxation is understood from emergent conservation laws of the total charge and the associated dipole moment that arise from the effective Hamiltonian projected onto the lowest Landau level, leading to subdiffusive fracton hydrodynamics. We discuss the prospect of rotating quantum gases as well as ultracold atoms in optical lattices for observing this unconventional relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum simulators of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.</description>

      <title>Extending the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies: new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing industrial relevance of quantum technologies (QTs), a new quantum workforce with special qualification will be needed. Building this workforce requires educational efforts, from short-term training to degree programs. In order to plan, map and compare such efforts, personal qualifications or job requirements, standardization is necessary. The European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) provides a common language for QT education. The 2024 update to version 2.5 extends it with the new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles: The proficiency triangle proposes six proficiency levels for three proficiency areas, specifying knowledge and skills for each level. Nine qualification profiles show prototypical qualifications or job roles relevant to the quantum industry with the required proficiency, examples, and suggestions. This is an important step towards the standardization of QT education. The CFQT update is based on the results of an analysis of 34 interviews on industry needs. The initial findings from the interviews were complemented by iterative refinement and expert consultation, as well as by ML-driven analysis and mapping of job posts, revealing recommendations for formulating job posts.</description>

      <title>Formation, Prevalence and Stability of Bouncing-Ball Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schr\"odinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color laser driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we unifiedly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense laser (non-perturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the spatial symmetry of the laser-field trajectory. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zero-th order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift or injection current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multiple-color laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single metallocene molecules act as sensitive spin detectors when decorating the probe of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). However, the impact of the atomic-scale electrode details on the molecular spin state has remained elusive to date. Here, a nickelocene (Nc) STM junction is manipulated in an atom-wise manner showing clearly the dependence of the spin excitation spectrum on the anchoring of Nc to Cu(111), a Cu monomer and trimer. Moreover, while the spin state of the same Nc tip is a triplet with tunable spin excitation energies upon contacting the surface, it transitions to a Kondo-screened doublet on a Cu atom. Notably, the non-trivial magnetic exchange interaction of the molecular spin with the electron continuum of the substrate determines the spectral line shape of the spin excitations.</description>

      <title>Tridiagonal Hamiltonians modeling the density of states of the Double-Scaled SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the global density of states (DOS) in the Double-Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) model, we construct a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian that replicates this DOS. We then tridiagonalize the Hamiltonian to determine the mean Lanczos coefficients within the parameter range. The bulk Lanczos coefficients, especially the Lanczos descent can be analytically expressed as a particular $q$-deformation of the logarithm. Our numerical results are further corroborated by semi-analytical findings, a random matrix potential construction in the bulk, and the analytic results at the edge of the Lanczos spectra using the method of moments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and invariance algebras of the $d$-dimensional Dunkl-Coulomb problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the rich algebraic structure of the standard $d$-dimensional Coulomb problem can be extended to its Dunkl counterpart. Replacing standard derivatives by Dunkl ones in the so($d+1$,2) dynamical algebra generators of the former gives rise to a deformed algebra with similar commutation relations, except that the metric tensor becomes dependent on the reflection operators and that there are some additional commutation or anticommutation relations involving the latter. It is then shown that from some of the dynamical algebra generators it is straightforward to derive the integrals of motion of the Dunkl-Coulomb problem in Sturm representation. Finally, from the latter, the components of a deformed Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector are built. Together with the Dunkl angular momentum components, such operators insure the superintegrability of the Dunkl-Coulomb problem in Schr\"odinger representation.</description>

Abstract: Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits are analog quantum simulators able to emulate a wide range of tight-binding models in parameter regimes that are difficult to access or adjust in natural materials. In this work, we use a superconducting qubit array to emulate a tight-binding model on the rhombic lattice, which features flat bands. Enabled by broad adjustability of the dispersion of the energy bands and of on-site disorder, we examine regimes where flat-band localization and Anderson localization compete. We observe disorder-induced localization for dispersive bands and disorder-induced delocalization for flat bands. Remarkably, we find a sudden transition between the two regimes and, in its vicinity, the semblance of quantum critical scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending quantum control to increasingly complex systems is crucial for both advancing quantum technologies and fundamental physics. In trapped ion systems, quantum logic techniques that combine a well-controlled logic species with a more complex spectroscopy species have proven to be a powerful tool for extending the range of accessible species. Here, we demonstrate that a quantum system as complex as $^{48}$Ti$^+$ with its many metastable states can be controlled employing a combination of intrinsic thermalization due to collisions with background gas and quantum-logic techniques using a far-detuned Raman laser. The preparation of pure quantum states allows coherent manipulation and high resolution measurements of the Zeeman structure in $^{48}$Ti$^+$. The presented techniques are applicable to a wide range of ionic species giving access to a larger variety of systems for fundamental physics and constitute the first step for quantum-controlled spectroscopy of transition metals, relevant, e.g., for the interpretation of astrophysical spectra.</description>

      <title>D-Wave's Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver: Description and Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most prominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been introduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address specific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently utilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the Hybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to accelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and operational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this portfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this solver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across three combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Knapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this relatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to solve these three optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Study of Attacks on the HHL Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the quantum research community continues to grow and new algorithms are designed, developed, and implemented, it is crucial to start thinking about security aspects and potential threats that could result in misuse of the algorithms, or jeopardize the information processed with these quantum algorithms. This work focuses on exploration of two types of potential attacks that could be deployed on a cloud-based quantum computer by an attacker circuit trying to interfere with victim circuit. The two attacks, called Improper Initialization Attack (IIA) and Higher Energy Attack (HEA), are for the first time applied to a well-known and widely used quantum algorithm: HHL. The HHL algorithm is used in the field of machine learning and big data for solving systems of linear equations. This work evaluates the effect of the attacks on different qubits within the HHL algorithm: ancilla qubit, clock qubit, and b qubit. This work demonstrates that the two attacks are able to cause incorrect results, even when only one of the qubits in the victim algorithm is attacked. Having discovered the vulnerabilities, the work motivates the need for future work to develop defense strategies for each of these attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.</description>

Abstract: We consider two Hamiltonians that are close to each other, $H_1 \approx H_2 $, and analyze the time-decay of the corresponding Loschmidt echo $\mathfrak{M}(t) := |\langle \psi_0, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} t H_2} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} t H_1} \psi_0 \rangle|^2$ that expresses the effect of an imperfect time reversal on the initial state $\psi_0$. Our model Hamiltonians are deformed Wigner matrices that do not share a common eigenbasis. The main tools for our results are two-resolvent laws for such $H_1$ and $H_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical clocks measure proper time along their worldline, and Riemannian geometry provides tools for predicting the time shown by clocks in both flat and curved spacetimes. Common approaches to time in quantum systems, based for instance on wave functions or density matrices, tend to obscure this geometric property at the quantum level. Here, a new framework is demonstrated for perturbing the classical path-length functional to include quantum degrees of freedom within a modified Riemannian geometry. In this framework, a quantum clock travels on geodesics of a family of spacetimes deformed by parameters specifying the clock's quantum state. Detailed derivations provide potentially testable corrections to gravitational time-dilation in Schwarzschild spacetime that scale with the ratio of the clock's Compton wavelength to its wave packet's spatial extent.</description>

Abstract: The Maslov index of a periodic orbit is an important piece in the semiclassical quantization of non-integrable systems, while almost all existing techniques that lead to a rigorous calculation of this index are elaborate and mathematically demanding. In this paper, we describe a straightforward technique, for systems with two degrees of freedom, based on the Lagrangian descriptors. Our method is illustrated by applying it to the two-dimensional coupled quartic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Photonic Non-Abelian Braid Monopole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monopoles and braids are exotic but elusive aspects of fundamental theories of light and matter. In lattice systems, monopoles of band-structure degeneracies are subject to well-established no-go (doubling) theorems that appear to universally apply in closed Hermitian systems and open non-Hermitian systems alike. However, the non-Abelian braid topology of non-Hermitian multi-band systems provides a remarkable loophole to these constraints. Here we make use of this loophole, and experimentally implement, for the first time, a monopole degeneracy in a non-Hermitian three-band system in the form of a single third-order exceptional point. We explicitly demonstrate the intricate braiding topology and the non-Abelian fusion rules underlying the monopole degeneracy. The experiment is carried out using a new design of single-photon interferometry, enabling eigenstate and spectral resolutions for non-Hermitian multi-band systems with widely tunable parameters. Thus, the union of state-of-the-art experiments, fundamental theory, and everyday concepts such as braids paves the way toward the highly exotic non-Abelian topology unique to non-Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our experiments provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Mitigating noise in digital and digital-analog quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.12969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices lack error correction, limiting scalability for quantum algorithms. In this context, digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) offers a more resilient alternative quantum computing paradigm that outperforms digital quantum computation by combining the flexibility of single-qubit gates with the robustness of analog simulations. This work explores the impact of noise on both digital and DAQC paradigms and demonstrates DAQC's effectiveness in error mitigation. We compare the quantum Fourier transform and quantum phase estimation algorithms under a wide range of single and two-qubit noise sources in superconducting processors. DAQC consistently surpasses digital approaches in fidelity, particularly as processor size increases. Moreover, zero-noise extrapolation further enhances DAQC by mitigating decoherence and intrinsic errors, achieving fidelities above 0.95 for 8 qubits, and reducing computation errors to the order of $10^{-3}$. These results establish DAQC as a viable alternative for quantum computing in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01119v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling phase transitions in quantum systems via coupling to reservoirs has been mostly studied for idealized memory-less environments under the so-called Markov approximation. Yet, most quantum materials and experiments in the solid state, atomic, molecular and optical physics are coupled to reservoirs with finite memory times. Here, using the spectral theory of non-Markovian dissipative phase transitions developed in the companion paper [Debecker et al., Phys. Rev. A 110, 042201 (2024)], we show that memory effects can be leveraged to reshape matter phase boundaries, but also reveal the existence of dissipative phase transitions genuinely triggered by non-Markovian effects.</description>

      <title>Detecting Multipartite Entanglement Patterns using Single Particle Green's Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a protocol for detecting multipartite entanglement in itinerant many-body electronic systems using single particle Green's functions. To achieve this, we first establish a connection between the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and single particle Green's functions by constructing a set of witness operators built out of single electron creation and destruction operators in a doubled system. This set of witness operators is indexed by a momenta $k$. We compute the QFI for these witness operators and show that for thermal ensembles it can be expressed as an auto-convolution of the single particle spectral function. We then apply our framework to a one-dimensional fermionic system to showcase its effectiveness in detecting entanglement in itinerant electron models. We observe that the detected entanglement level is sensitive to the wave vector associated with witness operator. Our protocol will permit detecting entanglement in many-body systems using scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, two spectroscopies that measure the single particle Green's function. It offers the prospect of the experimental detection of entanglement through spectroscopies beyond the established route of measuring the dynamical spin response.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation implies symmetry-protected topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12227v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples, including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph state.</description>

      <title>Random Natural Gradient</title>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms appear to be the most promising approach for near-term quantum applications. An important bottleneck is the classical optimization loop, where the multiple local minima and the emergence of barren plateaux make these approaches less appealing. To improve the optimization the Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method [Quantum 4, 269 (2020)] was introduced - a method that uses information about the local geometry of the quantum state-space. While the QNG-based optimization is promising, in each step it requires more quantum resources, since to compute the QNG one requires $O(m^2)$ quantum state preparations, where $m$ is the number of parameters in the parameterized circuit. In this work we propose two methods that reduce the resources/state preparations required for QNG, while keeping the advantages and performance of the QNG-based optimization. Specifically, we first introduce the Random Natural Gradient (RNG) that uses random measurements and the classical Fisher information matrix (as opposed to the quantum Fisher information used in QNG). The essential quantum resources reduce to linear $O(m)$ and thus offer a quadratic "speed-up", while in our numerical simulations it matches QNG in terms of accuracy. We give some theoretical arguments for RNG and then benchmark the method with the QNG on both classical and quantum problems. Secondly, inspired by stochastic-coordinate methods, we propose a novel approximation to the QNG which we call Stochastic-Coordinate Quantum Natural Gradient that optimizes only a small (randomly sampled) fraction of the total parameters at each iteration. This method also performs equally well in our benchmarks, while it uses fewer resources than the QNG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is vital for improving quantum algorithms' accuracy on noisy near-term devices. A typical QEM method, called Virtual Distillation (VD), can suffer from imperfect implementation, potentially leading to worse outcomes than without mitigation. To address this, we introduce Circuit-Noise-Resilient Virtual Distillation (CNR-VD), which includes a calibration process using simple input states to enhance VD's performance despite circuit noise, aiming to recover the results of an ideally conducted VD circuit. Simulations show that CNR-VD significantly mitigates noise-induced errors in VD circuits, boosting accuracy by up to tenfold over standard VD. It provides positive error mitigation even under high noise, where standard VD fails. Furthermore, our estimator's versatility extends its utility beyond VD, enhancing outcomes in general Hadamard-Test circuits. The proposed CNR-VD significantly enhances the noise-resilience of VD, and thus is anticipated to elevate the performance of quantum algorithm implementations on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>An Updated Quantum Complementarity Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02743v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bohr's complementarity principle has long been a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, positing that, within a given experimental setup, a quantum system (or quanton) can exhibit either its wave-like character, denoted as $W$, or its particle-like character, denoted as $P$, but not both simultaneously. Modern interpretations of Bohr's complementarity principle acknowledge the coexistence of these aspects in the same experiment while introducing the constraint $W + P \le \alpha$. Notably, estimations of $W$ or $P$ frequently rely on indirect retrodiction methods, a practice that has led to the claim of the violation of Bohr's complementarity principle. By taking a different route, recent advancements demonstrate that quantum complementarity relations can be rigorously derived from the axioms of quantum mechanics. To reconcile these observations and eliminate potential paradoxes or violations, we propose an updated formulation for the quantum complementarity principle, which is stated as follows: \textit{For a given quantum state preparation $\rho_t$ at a specific instant of time $t$, the wave and particle behaviors of a quanton are constrained by a complementarity relation $\mf{W}(\rho_t) + \mf{P}(\rho_t) \le \alpha(d)$, which is derived directly from the axioms of quantum mechanics.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulating Hamiltonians governing physical systems has found a broad range of applications, from quantum chemistry to semiconductor design. In this work, we provide a new way of manipulating Hamiltonians, by transforming their eigenvalues while keeping their eigenstates unchanged. We develop a universal algorithm that deterministically implements any desired (suitably differentiable) function on the eigenvalues of any unknown Hamiltonian, whose positive-time and negative-time dynamics are given as a black box. Our algorithm uses correlated randomness to efficiently combine two subroutines -- namely controlization and Fourier series simulation -- exemplifying a general compilation procedure that we develop. The time complexity of our algorithm is significantly reduced using compilation compared to a na{\"i}ve concatenation of the subroutines and outperforms similar methods based on the quantum singular value transformation. Finally, to circumvent the need for the negative-time dynamics, we present a universal algorithm to transform positive-time to negative-time dynamics without adding an auxiliary qubit, which could also be of standalone interest.</description>

Abstract: Using spacetime Gaussian test functions, we find closed-form expressions for the smeared Wightman function, Feynman propagator, retarded and advanced Green's functions, causal propagator and symmetric propagator of a massless scalar field in the vacuum of Minkowski spacetime. We apply our results to localized quantum systems which interact with a quantum field in Gaussian spacetime regions and study different relativistic quantum information protocols. In the protocol of entanglement harvesting, we find a closed-form expression for the entanglement that can be acquired by probes which interact in Gaussian spacetime regions and obtain asymptotic results for the protocol. We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors can become entangled if there is two-way signalling between their interaction regions, providing closed-form expressions for the detectors' final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning with quantum kernels for classification problems is a growing area of research. Recently, quantum kernel alignment techniques that parameterise the kernel have been developed, allowing the kernel to be trained and therefore aligned with a specific dataset. While quantum kernel alignment is a promising technique, it has been hampered by considerable training costs because the full kernel matrix must be constructed at every training iteration. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel method that seeks to balance efficiency and performance. We present a sub-sampling training approach that uses a subset of the kernel matrix at each training step, thereby reducing the overall computational cost of the training. In this work, we apply the sub-sampling method to synthetic datasets and a real-world breast cancer dataset and demonstrate considerable reductions in the number of circuits required to train the quantum kernel while maintaining classification accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent quantum algorithmic developments, a feedback-based approach has shown promise for preparing quantum many-body system ground states and solving combinatorial optimization problems. This method utilizes quantum Lyapunov control to iteratively construct quantum circuits. Here, we propose a substantial enhancement by implementing a protocol that uses ideas from quantum Lyapunov control and the counterdiabatic driving protocol, a key concept from quantum adiabaticity. Our approach introduces an additional control field inspired by counterdiabatic driving. We apply our algorithm to prepare ground states in one-dimensional quantum Ising spin chains. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate a remarkable acceleration in population transfer to low-energy states within a significantly reduced time frame compared to conventional feedback-based quantum algorithms. This acceleration translates to a reduced quantum circuit depth, a critical metric for potential quantum computer implementation. We validate our algorithm on the IBM cloud computer, highlighting its efficacy in expediting quantum computations for many-body systems and combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: We study the effective stochastic dynamics of a semiclassical probe induced by linear optomechanical interactions with a quantum oscillator. Quantum fluctuations lead to state-dependent non-equilibrium noise, which is exponentially enhanced by wavepacket delocalization. For the case of nanoparticles coupled by the Coulomb interaction such noise can imprint potentially measurable signatures in multiparticle levitation experiments. Quantum-induced optomechanical fluctuations hold strong analogy to quantum gravitational wave noise and interconnect stochastic thermodynamics, graviton physics and the detection of gravity-mediated entanglement.</description>

      <title>Inverted-circuit zero-noise extrapolation for quantum gate error mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common approach to deal with gate errors in modern quantum-computing hardware is zero-noise extrapolation. By artificially amplifying errors and extrapolating the expectation values obtained with different error strengths towards the zero-error (zero-noise) limit, the technique aims at rectifying errors in noisy quantum computing systems. For an accurate extrapolation, it is essential to know the exact factors of the noise amplification. In this article, we propose a simple method for estimating the strength of errors occurring in a quantum circuit and demonstrate improved extrapolation results. The method determines the error strength for a circuit by appending to it the inverted circuit and measuring the probability of the initial state. The estimation of error strengths is easy to implement for arbitrary circuits and does not require a previous characterisation of noise properties. We compare this method with the conventional zero-noise extrapolation method and show that the novel method leads to a more accurate calculation of expectation values. Our method proves to be particularly effective on current hardware, showcasing its suitability for near-term quantum computing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent (DI) quantum secret sharing (QSS) can relax the security assumptions about the devices' internal workings and provide QSS the highest level of security in theory. The original DI QSS protocol proved its correctness and completeness under a causal independence assumption regarding measurement devices. However, there has been a lack of DI QSS's performance characterization in practical communication situations, which impedes its experimental demonstration and application in the future. Here, we propose a three-partite DI QSS protocol with noise preprocessing and postselection strategies and develop the numerical methods to implement its performance characterization in practical communication situations. The adoption of the noise preprocessing and postselection can reduce DI QSS's global detection efficiency threshold from 96.32% to 94.30% and increase the noise threshold from 7.148% to 8.072%. Our DI QSS protocol has two advantages. First, it is a DI QSS protocol with performance characterization in practical communication situations. Second, the adoption of noise preprocessing and postselection can effectively relax its experimental requirement and enhance the noise resistance. Our DI QSS protocol has potential for future experimental demonstration and application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era, we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits. We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively logarithmic depth, in the task of estimating observable expectation values. We then prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging the effective shallowness, we also design an efficient classical algorithm to estimate observable expectation values within any constant additive accuracy, with high probability over the choice of the circuit, in any circuit architecture. The runtime of the algorithm is independent of circuit depth, and for any inverse-polynomial target accuracy, it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output observable expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds for device-independent quantum key distribution with local Bell test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is achieving the required Bell violation over long distances, as the channel losses result in low overall detection efficiencies. Recent works have explored the concept of certifying nonlocal correlations over extended distances through the use of a local Bell test. Here, an additional quantum device is placed in close proximity to one party, using short-distance correlations to verify nonlocal behavior at long distances. However, existing works have either not resolved the question of DIQKD security against active attackers in this setup, or used methods that do not yield tight bounds on the keyrates. In this work, we introduce a general formulation of the keyrate computation task in this setup that can be combined with recently developed methods for analyzing standard DIQKD. Using this method, we show that if the short-distance devices exhibit sufficiently high detection efficiencies, positive keyrates can be achieved in the long-distance branch with lower detection efficiencies as compared to standard DIQKD setups. This highlights the potential for improved performance of DIQKD over extended distances in scenarios where short-distance correlations are leveraged to validate quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which significantly extends a previous approach in a specific noise model to arbitrary noisy models. In our constructions, it is crucial to use the QSVT-based FPAA, demonstrating for the first time the separation between any other amplitude amplification algorithms and the QSVT-based one in the application. We also show that the proposed decoders have high decoding performance and reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder.</description>

      <title>Higher-order incompatibility improves distinguishability of causal quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order quantum theory deals with causal quantum processes, described by quantum combs, and test procedures, described by quantum testers, "measuring" these processes. In this work, we show that "jointly non-implementable" or incompatible quantum testers perform better in distinguishability tasks than their compatible counterparts. To demonstrate our finding, we consider a specific two-party game based on distinguishing quantum combs. We show that the player does better at winning the game when they have exclusive access to incompatible testers over compatible ones. Moreover, we show that, using the resource theoretic measure convex weight, any general quantum resource present in testers is resourceful in quantum comb exclusion tasks. These investigations generalise, respectively, an earlier finding that incompatibility of quantum observables to be a bona fide resource in quantum state distinguishability tasks and another finding that any resource present in observables result in improved performance in state exclusion or antidistinguishability tasks.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Entanglement is Necessary for EFI Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regarding minimal assumptions, most of classical cryptography is known to depend on the existence of One-Way Functions (OWFs). However, recent evidence has shown that this is not the case when considering quantum resources. Besides the well known unconditional security of Quantum Key Distribution, it is now known that computational cryptography may be built on weaker primitives than OWFs, e.g., pseudo-random states [JLS18], one-way state generators [MY23], or EFI pairs of states [BCQ23]. We consider a new quantum resource, pseudo-entanglement, and show that the existence of EFI pairs, one of the current main candidates for the weakest computational assumption for cryptography (necessary for commitments, oblivious transfer, secure multi-party computation, computational zero-knowledge proofs), implies the existence of pseudo-entanglement, as defined by [ABF+24, ABV23] under some reasonable adaptations. We prove this by constructing a new family of pseudo-entangled quantum states given only EFI pairs. Our result has important implications for the field of computational cryptography. It shows that if pseudo-entanglement does not exist, then most of cryptography cannot exist either. Moreover, it establishes pseudo-entanglement as a new minimal assumption for most of computational cryptography, which may pave the way for the unification of other assumptions into a single primitive. Finally, pseudo-entanglement connects physical phenomena and efficient computation, thus, our result strengthens the connection between cryptography and the physical world.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dynamical localization and precision measurement of BEC micromotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) based atom-optic kicked rotor to generate an asymmetrically localized momentum distribution that depends upon initial velocity of the BEC. Asymmetric features are shown to arise from the early-time dynamics induced by the broken parity symmetry and, asymptotically freeze as the dynamical localization stabilizes. The asymmetry in the momentum distribution critically depends upon the initial launch velocity and is sensitive to very small initial velocities ('micromotion') of the BEC. In this work, we also perform a precise measurement of the 'micromotion'. By utilizing the technique of measuring the early-time asymmetry of momentum distribution, we report measurement of micromotion down to (230 \pm 17 , \mu\text{m/s}).</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Gibbs ensemble as a steady state in Lindbladian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly construct unique non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of Lindblad master equation characterized by a Gibbs ensemble $\rho_{\text{NESS}} \propto e^{-\beta \tilde{H}}$, where the effective Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ consists only of $U(1)$ conserved charges of the original Hamiltonian. Specifically, when the original Hamiltonian has multiple charges, it is possible to couple them with bathes at different temperature respectively, but still leads to an equilibrium state. To access the Gibbs NESS, the jump operators need to be properly chosen to fulfill quantum detailed balance condition (qDBC). These jump operators are ladder operators for $\tilde{H}$ and jump process they generate form a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph (wDAG). By studying the XX model and Fredkin model, we showcase how the Gibbs state emerges as the unique steady state.</description>

Abstract: The generation of squeezed Fock states by the one or more photon subtraction from a two-mode entangled Gaussian state using a beam splitter and a controlled-Z operation is addressed. From two different perspectives, we analyzed two entanglement transformations in the protocol. We evaluated the energy costs and resource requirements of the analyzed schemes. Furthermore, we studied the impact of experimental imperfections on the non-Gaussian states generated by measuring the number of particles. We explored the effects of photon loss and imperfect detectors on the squeezed Fock state generation protocol.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition in the Quantum Capacity of Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the capacities of quantum channels is one of the fundamental problems of quantum information theory. This problem is extremely challenging and technically difficult, allowing only lower and upper bounds to be calculated for certain types of channels. In this paper, we prove that every quantum channel $\Lambda$ in arbitrary dimension, when contaminated by white noise in the form $\Lambda_x(\rho)=(1-x)\Lambda(\rho)+x\text{Tr}(\rho) \frac{I}{d}$, completely loses its capacity of transmiting quantum states when $x\geq \frac{1}{2}$, no matter what type of encoding and decoding is used. In other words, the quantum capacity of the channel vanishes in this region. To show this, we prove that the quantum depolarizing channel in $d$ dimension, defined as $\mathcal{D}_x (\rho):=(1-x)\rho+\frac{x}{d}I_d$ is anti-degradable when $x\geq \frac{1}{2}$. Although there are indirect proofs of this property, we explicitly find the quantum channel ${\cal N}_x$, which anti-degrades this channel. Furthermore, in this way, we find a new channel, namely ${\cal D}^c_x$ which is degradable in the same region. Being degradable, means that this new channel enjoys additive property for its quantum capacity.</description>

      <title>On estimates of trace-norm distance between quantum Gaussian states</title>

Abstract: In the paper of F.A. Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti, L. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the trace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of elements in the $\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian states. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based on a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more straightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent, especially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend on number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with infinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful inequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to the problem leading to different results. In the Appendix we briefly recall our results concerning estimates of the overlap for general fermionic Gaussian states of CAR.The problem studied in this paper can be considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance distance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical probability theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has shown theoretical promise of speedup in several machine learning tasks, including generative tasks using generative adversarial networks (GANs). While quantum computers have been implemented with different types of technologies, recently, analog Rydberg atom quantum computers have been demonstrated to have desirable properties such as reconfigurable qubit (quantum bit) positions and multi-qubit operations. To leverage the properties of this technology, we propose ReCon, the first work to implement quantum GANs on analog Rydberg atom quantum computers. Our evaluation using simulations and real-computer executions shows 33% better quality (measured using Frechet Inception Distance (FID)) in generated images than the state-of-the-art technique implemented on superconducting-qubit technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The noise-biased Kerr-cat qubit is an attractive candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation; however, its initialization faces challenges due to the squeezing pump-induced frequency shift (PIFS). Here, we propose and demonstrate a dynamic compensation method to mitigate the effect of PIFS during the Kerr-cat qubit initialization. Utilizing a novel nonlinearity-engineered triple-loop SQUID device, we realize a stabilized Kerr-cat qubit and validate the advantages of the dynamic compensation method by improving the initialization fidelity from 57% to 78%, with a projected fidelity of 91% after excluding state preparation and measurement errors. Our results not only advance the practical implementation of Kerr-cat qubits, but also provide valuable insights into the fundamental adiabatic dynamics of these systems. This work paves the way for scalable quantum processors that leverage the bias-preserving properties of Kerr-cat qubits.</description>

      <title>Founding Quantum Cryptography on Quantum Advantage, or, Towards Cryptography from $\mathsf{\#P}$-Hardness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent oracle separations [Kretschmer, TQC'21, Kretschmer et. al., STOC'23] have raised the tantalizing possibility of building quantum cryptography from sources of hardness that persist even if the polynomial hierarchy collapses. We realize this possibility by building quantum bit commitments and secure computation from unrelativized, well-studied mathematical problems that are conjectured to be hard for $\mathsf{P^{\#P}}$ -- such as approximating the permanents of complex Gaussian matrices, or approximating the output probabilities of random quantum circuits. Indeed, we show that as long as any one of the conjectures underlying sampling-based quantum advantage (e.g., BosonSampling, Random Circuit Sampling, IQP, etc.) is true, quantum cryptography can be based on the extremely mild assumption that $\mathsf{P^{\#P}} \not\subseteq \mathsf{(io)BQP/qpoly}$. We prove that the following hardness assumptions are equivalent. (1) The hardness of approximating the probability assigned to a randomly chosen string in the support of certain efficiently sampleable distributions (upto inverse polynomial multiplicative error).(2) The existence of one-way puzzles, where a quantum sampler outputs a pair of classical strings -- a puzzle and its key -- and where the hardness lies in finding the key corresponding to a random puzzle. These are known to imply quantum bit commitments [Khurana and Tomer, STOC'24]. (3) The existence of state puzzles, or one-way state synthesis, where it is hard to synthesize a secret quantum state given a public classical identifier. These capture the hardness of search problems with quantum inputs (secrets) and classical outputs (challenges). These are the first constructions of quantum cryptographic primitives (one-way puzzles, quantum bit commitments, state puzzles) from concrete, well-founded mathematical assumptions that do not imply the existence of classical cryptography.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses frequency crowding constraints in modular quantum architecture design, focusing on the SNAIL-based quantum modules. Two key objectives are explored. First, we present physics-informed design constraints by describing a physical model for realizable gates within a SNAIL module and building a fidelity model using error budgeting derived from device characteristics. Second, we tackle the allocation problem by analyzing the impact of frequency crowding on gate fidelity as the radix of the module increases. We explore whether the gate fidelity can be preserved with a discrete set of qubit frequencies while adhering to defined separation thresholds. This work offers insights into novel quantum architectures and coupled optimization techniques to mitigate the effects of unstable noise and improve overall gate performance.</description>

      <title>LEGO: QEC Decoding System Architecture for Dynamic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a critical component of FTQC; the QEC decoder is an important part of Classical Computing for Quantum or C4Q. Recent years have seen fast development in real-time QEC decoders. Existing efforts to build real-time decoders have yet to achieve a critical milestone: decoding dynamic logical circuits with error-corrected readout and feed forward. Achieving this requires significant engineering effort to adapt and reconfigure the decoders during runtime, depending on the branching of the logical circuit.
  We present a QEC decoder architecture called LEGO, with the ambitious goal of supporting dynamic logical operations. LEGO employs a novel abstraction called the decoding block to describe the decoding problem of a dynamic logical circuit. Moreover, decoding blocks can be combined with three other ideas to improve the efficiency, accuracy and latency of the decoder. First, they provide data and task parallelisms when combined with fusion-based decoding. Second, they can exploit the pipeline parallelism inside multi-stage decoders. Finally, they serve as basic units of work for computational resource management.
  Using decoding blocks, LEGO can be easily reconfigured to support all QEC settings and to easily accommodate innovations in three interdependent fields: code, logical operations and qubit hardware. In contrast, existing decoders are highly specialized to a specific QEC setting, which leads to redundant research and engineering efforts, slows down innovation, and further fragments the nascent quantum computing industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07577v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are being used to improve the probing of the state spaces of many particle systems as approximations to wavefunctions and in order to avoid the recurring sign problem of quantum monte-carlo. One may ask whether the usual classical neural networks have some actual hidden quantum properties that make them such suitable tools for a highly coupled quantum problem. I discuss here what makes a system quantum and to what extent we can interpret a neural network as having quantum remnants. I suggest that a system can be quantum both due to its fundamental quantum constituents and due to the rules of its functioning, therefore, we can obtain entanglement both due to the quantum constituents' nature and due to the functioning rules, or, in category theory terms, both due to the quantum nature of the objects of a category and of the maps. From a practical point of view, I suggest a possible experiment that could extract entanglement from the quantum functioning rules (maps) of an otherwise classical (from the point of view of the constituents) neural network.</description>

      <title>Robust Finite-Temperature Many-Body Scarring on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanisms for suppressing thermalization in disorder-free many-body systems, such as Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest in foundations of quantum statistical physics and potential quantum information processing applications. However, their sensitivity to realistic effects such as finite temperature remains largely unexplored. Here, we have utilized IBM's Kolkata quantum processor to demonstrate an unexpected robustness of quantum many-body scars at finite temperatures when the system is prepared in a thermal Gibbs ensemble. We identify such robustness in the PXP model, which describes quantum many-body scars in experimental systems of Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold atoms in tilted Bose--Hubbard optical lattices. By contrast, other theoretical models which host exact quantum many-body scars are found to lack such robustness, and their scarring properties quickly decay with temperature. Our study sheds light on the important differences between scarred models in terms of their algebraic structures, which impacts their resilience to finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Designing metasurface optical interfaces for solid-state qubits using many-body adjoint shape optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general strategy for the inverse design of metasurfaces composed of elementary shapes. We use it to design a structure that collects and collimates light from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Such metasurfaces constitute scalable optical interfaces for solid-state qubits, enabling efficient photon coupling into optical fibers and eliminating free-space collection optics. The many-body shape optimization strategy is a practical alternative to topology optimization that explicitly enforces material and fabrication constraints throughout the optimization, while still achieving high performance. The metasurface is easily adaptable to other solid-state qubits, and the optimization method is broadly applicable to fabrication-constrained photonic design problems.</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally dominated instantons and instability of dS, AdS and Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <title>Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpi\'nski gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpi\'nski gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>Electrical excitation of color centers in phosphorus-doped diamond Schottky diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A robust quantum light source operating upon electrical injection at ambient conditions is desirable for practical implementation of quantum technologies, such as quantum key distribution or metrology. Color centers in diamond are promising candidates as they are photostable emitters at room and elevated temperatures. The possibility of their electrical excitation has already been demonstrated within p-i-n diodes. However, this requires the growth of complex diamond structures. In contrast to these conventional approaches, we demonstrate the emission of color centers under electrical pumping in a novel Schottky diode configuration based on hydrogen passivated n-type diamond, which holds promise for integrated single-photon emitting devices based on color centers in diamond.</description>

      <title>Thermal Decay of Planar Jones-Roberts Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous planar superfluids exhibit a range of low-energy excitations that also appear in highly excited states like superfluid turbulence. In dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensates, the Jones- Roberts soliton family includes vortex dipoles and rarefaction pulses in the low and high velocity regimes, respectively. These excitations carry both energy and linear momentum, making their decay characteristics crucial for understanding superfluid dynamics. In this work, we develop the theory of planar soliton decay due to thermal effects, as described by the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii theory of reservoir interactions. We analyze two distinct damping terms involving transfer between the condensate and the non-condensate reservoir: particle transfer that also involves energy and usually drives condensate growth, and number-conserving energy transfer. We provide analytical treatments for both the low and high velocity regimes and identify conditions under which either mechanism dominates. Our findings indicate that energy damping prevails at high phase space density. These theoretical results are supported by numerical studies covering the entire velocity range from vortex dipole to rarefaction pulse. We use interaction energy to characterize rarefaction pulses, analogous to the distance between vortices in vortex dipoles, offering an experimentally accessible test for finite temperature theory in Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Imaging coupled vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics triggered by interaction with light often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Characterizing the resulting coupled electronic and nuclear wave packet motion represents a severe challenge, even for small polyatomic systems. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) in combination with quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the role of the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. A conical intersection between these states couples the bending and asymmetric stretching coordinates, which is clearly reflected in the correlated fragment momenta. Our results suggest that multi-coincident CEI represents an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>

Abstract: The rates of production of radio/microwave N-identical photons states |N&gt; from stimulated emission in the solar atmosphere are estimated. Effects of various decohering factors are shown to be small. Ground based measurements of these quantum states via the inverse HOM effect are proposed. We argue that a signal is detectable and far above the noise in several cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body solver using artificial neural networks and its applications to strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.</description>
