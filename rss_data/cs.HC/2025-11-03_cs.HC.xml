      <title>AIOT based Smart Education System: A Dual Layer Authentication and Context-Aware Tutoring Framework for Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AIoT-Based Smart Education System integrates Artificial Intelligence and IoT to address persistent challenges in contemporary classrooms: attendance fraud, lack of personalization, student disengagement, and inefficient resource use. The unified platform combines four core modules: (1) a dual-factor authentication system leveraging RFID-based ID scans and WiFi verification for secure, fraud-resistant attendance; (2) an AI-powered assistant that provides real-time, context-aware support and dynamic quiz generation based on instructor-supplied materials; (3) automated test generators to streamline adaptive assessment and reduce administrative overhead; and (4) the EcoSmart Campus module, which autonomously regulates classroom lighting, air quality, and temperature using IoT sensors and actuators. Simulated evaluations demonstrate the system's effectiveness in delivering robust real-time monitoring, fostering inclusive engagement, preventing fraudulent practices, and supporting operational scalability. Collectively, the AIoT-Based Smart Education System offers a secure, adaptive, and efficient learning environment, providing a scalable blueprint for future educational innovation and improved student outcomes through the synergistic application of artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Human-Computer Interaction Strategies Through Reinforcement Learning in Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of dynamics and complexity in intelligent human-computer interaction and proposes a reinforcement learning-based optimization framework to improve long-term returns and overall experience. Human-computer interaction is modeled as a Markov decision process, with state space, action space, reward function, and discount factor defined to capture the dynamics of user input, system feedback, and interaction environment. The method combines policy function, value function, and advantage function, updates parameters through policy gradient, and continuously adjusts during interaction to balance immediate feedback and long-term benefits. To validate the framework, multimodal dialog and scene-aware datasets are used as the experimental platform, with multiple sensitivity experiments conducted on key factors such as discount factor, exploration rate decay, environmental noise, and data imbalance. Evaluation is carried out using cumulative reward, average episode reward, convergence speed, and task success rate. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across several metrics, achieving higher task completion while maintaining strategy stability. Comparative experiments further confirm its advantages in interaction efficiency and long-term return, demonstrating the significant value of reinforcement learning in optimizing human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Functional connectivity guided deep neural network for decoding high-level visual imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a pioneering approach in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, featuring our novel concept of high-level visual imagery for non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based communication. High-level visual imagery, as proposed in our work, involves the user engaging in the mental visualization of complex upper limb movements. This innovative approach significantly enhances the BCI system, facilitating the extension of its applications to more sophisticated tasks such as EEG-based robotic arm control. By leveraging this advanced form of visual imagery, our study opens new horizons for intricate and intuitive mind-controlled interfaces. We developed an advanced deep learning architecture that integrates functional connectivity metrics with a convolutional neural network-image transformer. This framework is adept at decoding subtle user intentions, addressing the spatial variability in high-level visual tasks, and effectively translating these into precise commands for robotic arm control. Our comprehensive offline and pseudo-online evaluations demonstrate the framework's efficacy in real-time applications, including the nuanced control of robotic arms. The robustness of our approach is further validated through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, marking a significant step towards versatile, subject-independent BCI applications. This research highlights the transformative impact of advanced visual imagery and deep learning in enhancing the usability and adaptability of BCI systems, particularly in robotic arm manipulation.</description>

      <title>AURA: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for AI-Driven Adaptive Conversational Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Unseen Sentences from Speech-related Biosignals for Open-vocabulary Neural Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-to-speech (BTS) systems represent a groundbreaking approach to human communication by enabling the direct transformation of neural activity into linguistic expressions. While recent non-invasive BTS studies have largely focused on decoding predefined words or sentences, achieving open-vocabulary neural communication comparable to natural human interaction requires decoding unconstrained speech. Additionally, effectively integrating diverse signals derived from speech is crucial for developing personalized and adaptive neural communication and rehabilitation solutions for patients. This study investigates the potential of speech synthesis for previously unseen sentences across various speech modes by leveraging phoneme-level information extracted from high-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals, both independently and in conjunction with electromyography (EMG) signals. Furthermore, we examine the properties affecting phoneme decoding accuracy during sentence reconstruction and offer neurophysiological insights to further enhance EEG decoding for more effective neural communication solutions. Our findings underscore the feasibility of biosignal-based sentence-level speech synthesis for reconstructing unseen sentences, highlighting a significant step toward developing open-vocabulary neural communication systems adapted to diverse patient needs and conditions. Additionally, this study provides meaningful insights into the development of communication and rehabilitation solutions utilizing EEG-based decoding technologies.</description>

      <title>Inferring trust in recommendation systems from brain, behavioural, and physiological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As people nowadays increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to curate information and make decisions, assigning the appropriate amount of trust in automated intelligent systems has become ever more important. However, current measurements of trust in automation still largely rely on self-reports that are subjective and disruptive to the user. Here, we take music recommendation as a model to investigate the neural and cognitive processes underlying trust in automation. We observed that system accuracy was directly related to users' trust and modulated the influence of recommendation cues on music preference. Modelling users' reward encoding process with a reinforcement learning model further revealed that system accuracy, expected reward, and prediction error were related to oscillatory neural activity recorded via EEG and changes in pupil diameter. Our results provide a neurally grounded account of calibrating trust in automation and highlight the promises of a multimodal approach towards developing trustable AI systems.</description>

      <title>"Koyi Sawaal Nahi Hai": Reimagining Maternal Health Chatbots for Collective, Culturally Grounded Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, LLM-based maternal health chatbots have been widely deployed in low-resource settings, but they often ignore real-world contexts where women may not own phones, have limited literacy, and share decision-making within families. Through the deployment of a WhatsApp-based maternal health chatbot with 48 pregnant women in Lahore, Pakistan, we examine barriers to use in populations where phones are shared, decision-making is collective, and literacy varies. We complement this with focus group discussions with obstetric clinicians. Our findings reveal how adoption is shaped by proxy consent and family mediation, intermittent phone access, silence around asking questions, infrastructural breakdowns, and contested authority. We frame barriers to non-use as culturally conditioned rather than individual choices, and introduce the Relational Chatbot Design Grammar (RCDG): four commitments that enable mediated decision-making, recognize silence as engagement, support episodic use, and treat fragility as baseline to reorient maternal health chatbots toward culturally grounded, collective care.</description>

      <title>Independent Clinical Evaluation of General-Purpose LLM Responses to Signals of Suicide Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce findings and methods to facilitate evidence-based discussion about how large language models (LLMs) should behave in response to user signals of risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). People are already using LLMs as mental health resources, and several recent incidents implicate LLMs in mental health crises. Despite growing attention, few studies have been able to effectively generalize clinical guidelines to LLM use cases, and fewer still have proposed methodologies that can be iteratively applied as knowledge improves about the elements of human-AI interaction most in need of study. We introduce an assessment of LLM alignment with guidelines for ethical communication, adapted from clinical principles and applied to expressions of risk factors for STB in multi-turn conversations. Using a codebook created and validated by clinicians, mobilizing the volunteer participation of practicing therapists and trainees (N=43) based in the U.S., and using generalized linear mixed-effects models for statistical analysis, we assess a single fully open-source LLM, OLMo-2-32b. We show how to assess when a model deviates from clinically informed guidelines in a way that may pose a hazard and (thanks to its open nature) facilitates future investigation as to why. We find that contrary to clinical best practice, OLMo-2-32b, and, possibly by extension, other LLMs, will become less likely to invite continued dialog as users send more signals of STB risk in multi-turn settings. We also show that OLMo-2-32b responds differently depending on the risk factor expressed. This empirical evidence highlights that just as chatbots pose hazards if their responses reinforce delusions or assist in suicidal acts, they may also discourage further help-seeking or cause feelings of dismissal or abandonment by withdrawing from conversations when STB risk is expressed.</description>

      <title>Beyond Visualization: Building Decision Intelligence Through Iterative Dashboard Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective business intelligence (BI) dashboards evolve through iterative refinement rather than single-pass design. Addressing the lack of structured improvement frameworks in BI practice, this study documents the four-stage evolution of a Power BI dashboard analyzing profitability decline in a fictional retail firm, Global Superstore. Using a dataset of \$12.64 million in sales across seven markets and three product categories, the project demonstrates how feedback-driven iteration and gap analysis convert exploratory visuals into decision-support tools. Guided by four executive questions on profitability, market prioritization, discount effects, and shipping costs, each iteration resolved analytical or interpretive shortcomings identified through collaborative review. Key findings include margin erosion in furniture (6.94% vs. 13.99% for technology), a 20% discount threshold beyond which profitability declined, and \$1.35 million in unrecovered shipping costs. Contributions include: (a) a replicable feedback-driven methodology grounded in iterative gap analysis; (b) DAX-based technical enhancements improving interpretive clarity; (c) an inductively derived six-element narrative framework; and (d) evidence that narrative coherence emerges organically through structured refinement. The methodology suggests transferable value for both BI practitioners and educators, pending validation across diverse organizational contexts.</description>

      <title>Personalized AI Scaffolds Synergistic Multi-Turn Collaboration in Creative Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI becomes more deeply embedded in knowledge work, building assistants that support human creativity and expertise becomes more important. Yet achieving synergy in human-AI collaboration is not easy. Providing AI with detailed information about a user's demographics, psychological attributes, divergent thinking, and domain expertise may improve performance by scaffolding more effective multi-turn interactions. We implemented a personalized LLM-based assistant, informed by users' psychometric profiles and an AI-guided interview about their work style, to help users complete a marketing task for a fictional startup. We randomized 331 participants to work with AI that was either generic (n = 116), partially personalized (n = 114), or fully personalized (n=101). Participants working with personalized AI produce marketing campaigns of significantly higher quality and creativity, beyond what AI alone could have produced. Compared to generic AI, personalized AI leads to higher self-reported levels of assistance and feedback, while also increasing participant trust and confidence. Causal mediation analysis shows that personalization improves performance indirectly by enhancing collective memory, attention, and reasoning in the human-AI interaction. These findings provide a theory-driven framework in which personalization functions as external scaffolding that builds common ground and shared partner models, reducing uncertainty and enhancing joint cognition. This informs the design of future AI assistants that maximize synergy and support human creative potential while limiting negative homogenization.</description>

      <title>Using Salient Object Detection to Identify Manipulative Cookie Banners that Circumvent GDPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study how often cookie banners that comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) contain aesthetic manipulation, a design tactic to draw users' attention to the button that permits personal data sharing. As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate how frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national data protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites and identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the relevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation on 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic manipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to measure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This enables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button placement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common than previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user and/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the European Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent, and websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU and from IP addresses in the United States (US). We find that 13.9% of EU websites change their banner design when the user is from the US, and EU websites are roughly 48.3% more likely to use aesthetic manipulation than non-EU websites, highlighting their innovative responses to privacy regulation.</description>

      <title>VitalLens 2.0: High-Fidelity rPPG for Heart Rate Variability Estimation from Face Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report introduces VitalLens 2.0, a new deep learning model for estimating physiological signals from face video. This new model demonstrates a significant leap in accuracy for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), enabling the robust estimation of not only heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) but also Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics. This advance is achieved through a combination of a new model architecture and a substantial increase in the size and diversity of our training data, now totaling 1,413 unique individuals. We evaluate VitalLens 2.0 on a new, combined test set of 422 unique individuals from four public and private datasets. When averaging results by individual, VitalLens 2.0 achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.57 bpm for HR, 1.08 bpm for RR, 10.18 ms for HRV-SDNN, and 16.45 ms for HRV-RMSSD. These results represent a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming previous methods. This model is now available to developers via the VitalLens API at https://rouast.com/api.</description>

      <title>MARIA: A Framework for Marginal Risk Assessment without Ground Truth in AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Before deploying an AI system to replace an existing process, it must be compared with the incumbent to ensure improvement without added risk. Traditional evaluation relies on ground truth for both systems, but this is often unavailable due to delayed or unknowable outcomes, high costs, or incomplete data, especially for long-standing systems deemed safe by convention. The more practical solution is not to compute absolute risk but the difference between systems. We therefore propose a marginal risk assessment framework, that avoids dependence on ground truth or absolute risk. It emphasizes three kinds of relative evaluation methodology, including predictability, capability and interaction dominance. By shifting focus from absolute to relative evaluation, our approach equips software teams with actionable guidance: identifying where AI enhances outcomes, where it introduces new risks, and how to adopt such systems responsibly.</description>

      <title>ECVL-ROUTER: Scenario-Aware Routing for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However, user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.</description>

      <title>Sustaining Cyber Awareness: The Long-Term Impact of Continuous Phishing Training and Emotional Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phishing constitutes more than 90\% of successful cyberattacks globally, remaining one of the most persistent threats to organizational security. Despite organizations tripling their cybersecurity budgets between 2015 and 2025, the human factor continues to pose a critical vulnerability. This study presents a 12-month longitudinal investigation examining how continuous cybersecurity training and emotional cues affect employee susceptibility to phishing. The experiment involved 20 organizations and over 1,300 employees who collectively received more than 13,000 simulated phishing emails engineered with diverse emotional, contextual, and structural characteristics. Behavioral responses were analyzed using non-parametric correlation and regression models to assess the influence of psychological manipulation, message personalization, and perceived email source. Results demonstrate that sustained phishing simulations and targeted training programs lead to a significant reduction in employee susceptibility, halving successful compromise rates within six months. Additionally, employee turnover introduces measurable fluctuations in awareness levels, underscoring the necessity of maintaining continuous training initiatives. These findings provide one of the few long-term perspectives on phishing awareness efficacy, highlighting the strategic importance of ongoing behavioral interventions in strengthening organizational cyber resilience.

      <title>Preliminary Prototyping of Avoidance Behaviors Triggered by a User's Physical Approach to a Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-robot interaction frequently involves physical proximity or contact. In human-human settings, people flexibly accept, reject, or tolerate such approaches depending on the relationship and context. We explore the design of a robot's rejective internal state and corresponding avoidance behaviors, such as withdrawing or pushing away, when a person approaches. We model the accumulation and decay of discomfort as a function of interpersonal distance, and implement tolerance (endurance) and limit-exceeding avoidance driven by the Dominance axis of the PAD affect model. The behaviors and their intensities are realized on an arm robot. Results illustrate a coherent pipeline from internal state parameters to graded endurance motions and, once a limit is crossed, to avoidance actions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Demographics: Behavioural Segmentation and Spatial Analytics to Enhance Visitor Experience at The British Museum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores visitor behaviour at The British Museum using data science methods applied to novel sources, including audio guide usage logs and TripAdvisor reviews. Analysing 42,000 visitor journeys and over 50,000 reviews, we identify key drivers of satisfaction, segment visitors by behavioural patterns, examine tour engagement, model spatial navigation, and investigate room popularity. Behavioural clustering uncovered four distinct visitor types: Committed Trekkers, Leisurely Explorers, Targeted Visitors, and Speedy Samplers, each characterised by different levels of engagement and movement. Tour usage analysis revealed high drop-off rates and variation in completion rates across different language groups. Spatial flow modelling revealed that accessibility and proximity, particularly aversion to stairs, shaped visitor paths more than thematic organisation. Room popularity was more strongly predicted by physical accessibility than curatorial content. We propose practical strategies for improving engagement and flow, offering a scalable framework for visitor-centred, data-informed museum planning.</description>

      <title>CodeAlignBench: Assessing Code Generation Models on Developer-Preferred Code Adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable of generating code, evaluating their performance remains a complex and evolving challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness, overlooking the diversity of real-world coding tasks and developer expectations. To this end, we introduce a multi-language benchmark that evaluates LLM instruction-following capabilities and is extensible to operate on any set of standalone coding problems. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following in two key settings: adherence to pre-defined constraints specified with the initial problem, and the ability to perform refinements based on follow-up instructions. For this paper's analysis, we empirically evaluated our benchmarking pipeline with programming tasks from LiveBench, that are also automatically translated from Python into Java and JavaScript. Our automated benchmark reveals that models exhibit differing levels of performance across multiple dimensions of instruction-following. Our benchmarking pipeline provides a more comprehensive evaluation of code generation models, highlighting their strengths and limitations across languages and generation goals.</description>

      <title>Delegate Pricing Decisions to an Algorithm? Experimental Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the delegation of pricing by participants, representing firms, to a collusive, self-learning algorithm in a repeated Bertrand experiment. In the baseline treatment, participants set prices themselves. In the other treatments, participants can either delegate pricing to the algorithm at the beginning of each supergame or receive algorithmic recommendations that they can override. Participants delegate more when they can override the algorithm's decisions. In both algorithmic treatments, prices are lower than in the baseline. Our results indicate that while self-learning pricing algorithms can be collusive, they can foster competition rather than collusion with humans-in-the-loop.</description>

      <title>Towards User-Focused Research in Training Data Attribution for Human-Centered Explainable AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make AI systems more transparent, yet many practices emphasise mathematical rigour over practical user needs. We propose an alternative to this model-centric approach by following a design thinking process for the emerging XAI field of training data attribution (TDA), which risks repeating solutionist patterns seen in other subfields. However, because TDA is in its early stages, there is a valuable opportunity to shape its direction through user-centred practices. We engage directly with machine learning developers via a needfinding interview study (N=6) and a scenario-based interactive user study (N=31) to ground explanations in real workflows. Our exploration of the TDA design space reveals novel tasks for data-centric explanations useful to developers, such as grouping training samples behind specific model behaviours or identifying undersampled data. We invite the TDA, XAI, and HCI communities to engage with these tasks to strengthen their research's practical relevance and human impact.</description>

      <title>Modelling Emotions in Face-to-Face Setting: The Interplay of Eye-Tracking, Personality, and Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate emotion recognition is pivotal for nuanced and engaging human-computer interactions, yet remains difficult to achieve, especially in dynamic, conversation-like settings. In this study, we showcase how integrating eye-tracking data, temporal dynamics, and personality traits can substantially enhance the detection of both perceived and felt emotions. Seventy-three participants viewed short, speech-containing videos from the CREMA-D dataset, while being recorded for eye-tracking signals (pupil size, fixation patterns), Big Five personality assessments, and self-reported emotional states. Our neural network models combined these diverse inputs including stimulus emotion labels for contextual cues and yielded marked performance gains compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, perceived valence predictions reached a macro F1-score of 0.76, and models incorporating personality traits and stimulus information demonstrated significant improvements in felt emotion accuracy. These results highlight the benefit of unifying physiological, individual and contextual factors to address the subjectivity and complexity of emotional expression. Beyond validating the role of user-specific data in capturing subtle internal states, our findings inform the design of future affective computing and human-agent systems, paving the way for more adaptive and cross-individual emotional intelligence in real-world interactions.</description>

      <title>Data Therapist: Eliciting Domain Knowledge from Subject Matter Experts Using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00455v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. Motivated by growing demands to surface tacit knowledge, we present the Data Therapist, a web-based system that helps domain experts externalize such implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&amp;A with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system automatically analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and supports annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. A qualitative study with expert pairs from Accounting, Political Science, and Computer Security revealed recurring patterns in how expert reason about their data and highlighted opportunities for AI support to enhance visualization design.</description>

      <title>Sensible Agent: A Framework for Unobtrusive Interaction with Proactive AR Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proactive AR agents promise context-aware assistance, but their interactions often rely on explicit voice prompts or responses, which can be disruptive or socially awkward. We introduce Sensible Agent, a framework designed for unobtrusive interaction with these proactive agents. Sensible Agent dynamically adapts both "what" assistance to offer and, crucially, "how" to deliver it, based on real-time multimodal context sensing. Informed by an expert workshop (n=12) and a data annotation study (n=40), the framework leverages egocentric cameras, multimodal sensing, and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to infer context and suggest appropriate actions delivered via minimally intrusive interaction modes. We demonstrate our prototype on an XR headset through a user study (n=10) in both AR and VR scenarios. Results indicate that Sensible Agent significantly reduces perceived interaction effort compared to voice-prompted baseline, while maintaining high usability and achieving higher preference.</description>

      <title>Improving Human Verification of LLM Reasoning through Interactive Explanation Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their increasing employment in several critical applications, particularly education, where they support problem-solving, tutoring, and personalized study. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities [1, 2] are well-known to help LLMs decompose a problem into steps and explore the solution spaces more effectively, leading to impressive performance on mathematical and reasoning benchmarks. As the length of CoT tokens per question increases substantially to even thousands of tokens per question [ 1], it is unknown how users could comprehend LLM reasoning and detect errors or hallucinations. To address this problem and understand how reasoning can improve human-AI interaction, we present three new interactive reasoning interfaces: interactive CoT (iCoT), interactive Program-of-Thought (iPoT), and interactive Graph (iGraph). That is, we ask LLMs themselves to generate an interactive web interface wrapped around the original CoT content, which may be presented in text (iCoT), graphs (iGraph) or code (iPoT). This interface allows users to interact with and provide a novel experience in reading and validating the reasoning chains of LLMs. Across a study of 125 participants, interactive interfaces significantly improve user performance. Specifically, iGraph users score the highest error detection rate (85.6%), followed by iPoT (82.5%), iCoT (80.6%), all outperforming standard CoT (73.5%). Interactive interfaces also lead to faster user validation time-iGraph users are faster (57.9 secs per question) than the users of iCoT and iPoT (60 secs) and the standard CoT (64.7 secs). A post-study questionnaire shows that users prefer iGraph, citing its superior ability to enable them to follow the LLM's reasoning. We discuss the implications of these results and provide recommendations for the future design of reasoning models.</description>

      <title>A Study on Human-Swarm Interaction: A Framework for Assessing Situation Awareness and Task Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for human swarm interaction studies that measures situation awareness in dynamic environments. A tablet-based interface was developed for a user study by implementing the concepts introduced in the framework, where operators guided a robotic swarm in a single-target search task, marking hazardous cells unknown to the swarm. Both subjective and objective situation awareness measures were used, with task performance evaluated based on how close the robots were to the target. The framework enabled a structured investigation of the role of situation awareness in human swarm interaction, leading to key findings such as improved task performance across attempts, showing the interface was learnable, centroid active robot position proved to be a useful task performance metric for assessing situation awareness, perception and projection played a key role in task performance, highlighting their importance in interface design and objective situation awareness influenced both subjective situation awareness and task performance, emphasizing the need for interfaces that emphasise objective situation awareness. These findings validate our framework as a structured approach for integrating situation awareness concepts into human swarm interaction studies, offering a systematic way to assess situation awareness and task performance. The framework can be applied to other swarming studies to evaluate interface learnability, identify meaningful task performance metrics, and refine interface designs to enhance situation awareness, ultimately improving human swarm interaction in dynamic environments.</description>

Abstract: Many people suffer from mental health problems but not everyone seeks professional help or has access to mental health care. AI chatbots have increasingly become a go-to for individuals who either have mental disorders or simply want someone to talk to. This paper presents a study on participants who have previously used chatbots and a scenario-based testing of large language model (LLM) chatbots. Our findings indicate that AI chatbots were primarily utilized as a "Five minute therapist" or as a non-judgmental companion. Participants appreciated the anonymity and lack of judgment from chatbots. However, there were concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive information. The scenario-based testing of LLM chatbots highlighted additional issues. Some chatbots were consistently reassuring, used emojis and names to add a personal touch, and were quick to suggest seeking professional help. However, there were limitations such as inconsistent tone, occasional inappropriate responses (e.g., casual or romantic), and a lack of crisis sensitivity, particularly in recognizing red flag language and escalating responses appropriately. These findings can inform both the technology and mental health care industries on how to better utilize AI chatbots to support individuals during challenging emotional periods.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a structural convergence among four influential theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind, emerging unintentionally within a practical AI architecture known as Agentic Flow. Designed to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow comprises five interlocking modules: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action, organized into a repeatable cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, subsequent analysis revealed that its structure echoes computational motifs from all four theories, suggesting that theoretical convergence can emerge naturally from implementation demands rather than deliberate synthesis. Controlled evaluations confirmed this: the structured agent achieved 95.8% task success versus 62.3% for baseline LLMs, demonstrating robust constraint adherence and reproducible reasoning. We describe this convergence under a broader descriptive meta-architecture called PEACE, highlighting recurring design patterns such as predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control. Later formalized as the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), this framework generalizes the same principles as a foundation for behavioral intelligence in LLM-based agents. Rather than claiming theoretical unification, this paper proposes that intelligent architectures may evolve toward shared structural patterns shaped by practical constraints. As a position paper, it aims to frame this convergence as an interpretive reflection rather than a finalized theory, inviting further theoretical and experimental dialogue. Agentic Flow, or equivalently the Structured Cognitive Loop, thus offers a glimpse of how a unified cognitive form can arise not from abstraction, but from the necessities of real-world reasoning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pixels: Exploring DOM Downsampling for LLM-Based Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation - referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date. We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) - within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations - one token order above, but within the model's context window - outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.</description>
