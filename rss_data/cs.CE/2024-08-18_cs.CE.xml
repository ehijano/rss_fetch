      <title>Efficient low rank model order reduction of vibroacoustic problems under stochastic loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution combines a low-rank matrix approximation through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with second-order Krylov subspace-based Model Order Reduction (MOR), in order to efficiently propagate input uncertainties through a given vibroacoustic model. The vibroacoustic model consists of a plate coupled to a fluid into which the plate radiates sound due to a turbulent boundary layer excitation. This excitation is subject to uncertainties due to the stochastic nature of the turbulence and the computational cost of simulating the coupled problem with stochastic forcing is very high. The proposed method approximates the output uncertainties in an efficient way, by reducing the evaluation cost of the model in terms of DOFs and samples by using the factors of the SVD low-rank approximation directly as input for the MOR algorithm. Here, the covariance matrix of the vector of unknowns can efficiently be approximated with only a fraction of the original number of evaluations. Therefore, the approach is a promising step to further reducing the computational effort of large-scale vibroacoustic evaluations.</description>

      <title>Assessing and Enhancing Large Language Models in Rare Disease Question-answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in general medical domains, questions remain about their performance in diagnosing rare diseases. To answer this question, we aim to assess the diagnostic performance of LLMs in rare diseases, and explore methods to enhance their effectiveness in this area. In this work, we introduce a rare disease question-answering (ReDis-QA) dataset to evaluate the performance of LLMs in diagnosing rare diseases. Specifically, we collected 1360 high-quality question-answer pairs within the ReDis-QA dataset, covering 205 rare diseases. Additionally, we annotated meta-data for each question, facilitating the extraction of subsets specific to any given disease and its property. Based on the ReDis-QA dataset, we benchmarked several open-source LLMs, revealing that diagnosing rare diseases remains a significant challenge for these models.
  To facilitate retrieval augmentation generation for rare disease diagnosis, we collect the first rare diseases corpus (ReCOP), sourced from the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) database. Specifically, we split the report of each rare disease into multiple chunks, each representing a different property of the disease, including their overview, symptoms, causes, effects, related disorders, diagnosis, and standard therapies. This structure ensures that the information within each chunk aligns consistently with a question. Experiment results demonstrate that ReCOP can effectively improve the accuracy of LLMs on the ReDis-QA dataset by an average of 8%. Moreover, it significantly guides LLMs to generate trustworthy answers and explanations that can be traced back to existing literature.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Surrogates and Thompson Sampling for Multidisciplinary Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long runtime associated with simulating multidisciplinary systems challenges the use of Bayesian optimization for multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). This is particularly the case if the coupled system is modeled in a partitioned manner and feedback loops, known as strong coupling, are present. This work introduces a method for Bayesian optimization in MDO called "Multidisciplinary Design Optimization using Thompson Sampling", abbreviated as MDO-TS. Instead of replacing the whole system with a surrogate, we substitute each discipline with such a Gaussian process. Since an entire multidisciplinary analysis is no longer required for enrichment, evaluations can potentially be saved. However, the objective and associated uncertainty are no longer analytically estimated. Since most adaptive sampling strategies assume the availability of these estimates, they cannot be applied without modification. Thompson sampling does not require this explicit availability. Instead, Thompson sampling balances exploration and exploitation by selecting actions based on optimizing random samples from the objective. We combine Thompson sampling with an approximate sampling strategy that uses random Fourier features. This approach produces continuous functions that can be evaluated iteratively. We study the application of this infill criterion to both an analytical problem and the shape optimization of a simple fluid-structure interaction example.</description>

      <title>A fully explicit isogeometric collocation formulation for the dynamics of geometrically exact beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully explicit dynamic formulation for geometrically exact shear-deformable beams. The starting point of this work is an existing isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) formulation which is explicit in the strict sense of the time integration algorithm, but still requires a system matrix inversion due to the use of a consistent mass matrix. Moreover, in that work, the efficiency was also limited by an iterative solution scheme needed due to the presence of a nonlinear term in the time-discretized rotational balance equation. In the present paper, we address these limitations and propose a novel fully explicit formulation able to preserve high-order accuracy in space. This is done by extending a predictor--multicorrector approach, originally proposed for standard elastodynamics, to the case of the rotational dynamics of geometrically exact beams. The procedure relies on decoupling the Neumann boundary conditions and on a rearrangement and rescaling of the mass matrix. We demonstrate that an additional gain in terms of computational cost is obtained by properly removing the angular velocity-dependent nonlinear term in the rotational balance equation without any significant loss in terms of accuracy. The high-order spatial accuracy and the improved efficiency of the proposed formulation compared to the existing one are demonstrated through some numerical experiments covering different combinations of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Reinforcement Learning System for Realistic Vehicle Active Suspension Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The suspension system is a crucial part of the automotive chassis, improving vehicle ride comfort and isolating passengers from rough road excitation. Unlike passive suspension, which has constant spring and damping coefficients, active suspension incorporates electronic actuators into the system to dynamically control stiffness and damping variables. However, effectively controlling the suspension system poses a challenging task that necessitates real-time adaptability to various road conditions. This paper presents the Physics-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for adjusting an active suspension system's variable kinematics and compliance properties for a quarter-car model in real time. Specifically, the outputs of the model are defined as actuator stiffness and damping control, which are bound within physically realistic ranges to maintain the system's physical compliance. The proposed model was trained on stochastic road profiles according to ISO 8608 standards to optimize the actuator's control policy. According to qualitative results on simulations, the vehicle body reacts smoothly to various novel real-world road conditions, having a much lower degree of oscillation. These observations mean a higher level of passenger comfort and better vehicle stability. Quantitatively, DRL outperforms passive systems in reducing the average vehicle body velocity and acceleration by 43.58% and 17.22%, respectively, minimizing the vertical movement impacts on the passengers.

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Lipid Nanoparticle Formation for the Delivery of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.</description>

      <title>GLObal Building heights for Urban Studies (UT-GLOBUS) for city- and street- scale urban simulations: Development and first applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce University of Texas - Global Building heights for Urban Studies (UT-GLOBUS), a dataset providing building heights and urban canopy parameters (UCPs) for more than 1200 cities or locales worldwide. UT-GLOBUS combines open-source spaceborne altimetry (ICESat-2 and GEDI) and coarse-resolution urban canopy elevation data with a machine-learning model to estimate building-level information. Validation using LiDAR data from six US cities showed UT-GLOBUS-derived building heights had a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 9.1 meters. Validation of mean building heights within 1-km^2 grid cells, including data from Hamburg and Sydney, resulted in an RMSE of 7.8 meters. Testing the UCPs in the urban Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Urban) model resulted in a significant improvement (55% in RMSE) in intra-urban air temperature representation compared to the existing table-based local climate zone approach in Houston, TX. Additionally, we demonstrated the dataset's utility for simulating heat mitigation strategies and building energy consumption using WRF-Urban, with test cases in Chicago, IL, and Austin, TX. Street-scale mean radiant temperature simulations using the Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry (SOLWEIG) model, incorporating UT-GLOBUS and LiDAR-derived building heights, confirmed the dataset's effectiveness in modeling human thermal comfort in Baltimore, MD (daytime RMSE = 2.85 C). Thus, UT-GLOBUS can be used for modeling urban hazards with significant socioeconomic and biometeorological risks, enabling finer scale urban climate simulations and overcoming previous limitations due to the lack of building information.</description>

      <title>No Language is an Island: Unifying Chinese and English in Financial Large Language Models, Instruction Data, and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the progression of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably propelled financial analysis, their application has largely been confined to singular language realms, leaving untapped the potential of bilingual Chinese-English capacity. To bridge this chasm, we introduce ICE-PIXIU, seamlessly amalgamating the ICE-INTENT model and ICE-FLARE benchmark for bilingual financial analysis. ICE-PIXIU uniquely integrates a spectrum of Chinese tasks, alongside translated and original English datasets, enriching the breadth and depth of bilingual financial modeling. It provides unrestricted access to diverse model variants, a substantial compilation of diverse cross-lingual and multi-modal instruction data, and an evaluation benchmark with expert annotations, comprising 10 NLP tasks, 20 bilingual specific tasks, totaling 95k datasets. Our thorough evaluation emphasizes the advantages of incorporating these bilingual datasets, especially in translation tasks and utilizing original English data, enhancing both linguistic flexibility and analytical acuity in financial contexts. Notably, ICE-INTENT distinguishes itself by showcasing significant enhancements over conventional LLMs and existing financial LLMs in bilingual milieus, underscoring the profound impact of robust bilingual data on the accuracy and efficacy of financial NLP.</description>

      <title>DeepClair: Utilizing Market Forecasts for Effective Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing market forecasts is pivotal in optimizing portfolio selection strategies. We introduce DeepClair, a novel framework for portfolio selection. DeepClair leverages a transformer-based time-series forecasting model to predict market trends, facilitating more informed and adaptable portfolio decisions. To integrate the forecasting model into a deep reinforcement learning-driven portfolio selection framework, we introduced a two-step strategy: first, pre-training the time-series model on market data, followed by fine-tuning the portfolio selection architecture using this model. Additionally, we investigated the optimization technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance the pre-trained forecasting model for fine-tuning in investment scenarios. This work bridges market forecasting and portfolio selection, facilitating the advancement of investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Address-Specific Sustainable Accommodation Choice Through Real-World Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consumers wish to choose sustainable accommodation for their travels, and in the case of corporations, may be required to do so. Yet accommodation marketplaces provide no meaningful capability for sustainable choice: typically CO2 estimates are provided that are identical for all accommodation of the same type across an entire country. We propose a decision support system that enables real choice of sustainable accommodation. We develop a data-driven address-specific metric called EcoGrade, which integrates government approved datasets and uses interpolation where data is sparse. We validate the metric on 10,000 UK addresses in 10 cities, showing the match of our interpolations to reality is statistically significant. We show how the metric has been embedded into a decision support system for a global accommodation marketplace and tested by real users over several months with positive user feedback. In the EU, forty percent of final energy consumption is from buildings. We need to encourage all building owners to make their accommodation more efficient. The rental sector is one area where change can occur rapidly, as rented accommodation is renovated frequently. We anticipate our decision support system using EcoGrade will encourage this positive change.</description>
