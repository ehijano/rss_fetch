      <title>Monetary Policy, Uncertainty, and Credit Supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how dispersion in banks' subjective inflation forecasts is a channel of the transmission of monetary policy to credit supply. We extend the Monti-Klein model of monopolistic banking by incorporating risk aversion, subjective beliefs, and ambiguity aversion. The model predicts that greater inflation uncertainty or asymmetry in beliefs raises equilibrium loan rates and amplifies credit rationing. Using AnaCredit loan-level data for France, we estimate finite-mixture density regressions that allow for latent heterogeneity in loan pricing. Empirically, we find that higher subjective uncertainty and asymmetry both increase average lending rates and skew their distribution, disproportionately affecting financially constrained firms in the right tail. Quantitatively, moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile of our indicators raises average borrowing costs by more than 10 basis points, which translates into roughly 0.5 billion euros of additional annual interest expenses for non-financial corporations. By contrast, forecast disagreement has a weaker and less systematic effect. Taken together, these results show that uncertainty and asymmetry in inflation expectations are independent and powerful drivers of credit conditions, underscoring their importance for understanding monetary policy transmission through the banking sector.</description>

      <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Economic Time Series: A Comprehensive Review and a Systematic Taxonomy of Methods and Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is increasingly required in computational economics, where machine-learning forecasters can outperform classical econometric models but remain difficult to audit and use for policy. This survey reviews and organizes the growing literature on XAI for economic time series, where autocorrelation, non-stationarity, seasonality, mixed frequencies, and regime shifts can make standard explanation techniques unreliable or economically implausible. We propose a taxonomy that classifies methods by (i) explanation mechanism: propagation-based approaches (e.g., Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation), perturbation and game-theoretic attribution (e.g., permutation importance, LIME, SHAP), and function-based global tools (e.g., Accumulated Local Effects); (ii) time-series compatibility, including preservation of temporal dependence, stability over time, and respect for data-generating constraints. We synthesize time-series-specific adaptations such as vector- and window-based formulations (e.g., Vector SHAP, WindowSHAP) that reduce lag fragmentation and computational cost while improving interpretability. We also connect explainability to causal inference and policy analysis through interventional attributions (Causal Shapley values) and constrained counterfactual reasoning. Finally, we discuss intrinsically interpretable architectures (notably attention-based transformers) and provide guidance for decision-grade applications such as nowcasting, stress testing, and regime monitoring, emphasizing attribution uncertainty and explanation dynamics as indicators of structural change.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Predictive Analytics for Social Media Enabled Women's Economic Empowerment in Pakistan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study investigates the interplay between young women's empowerment and Pakistan's economic growth, focusing on how social media use enhances their businesses and drives economic advancement. We utilize a mixed-methods research design, integrating both online and offline random sampling, for our survey of 51 respondents. We also utilized existing datasets consisting of both social media usage (n = 1000) and entrepreneurship (n = 1092). Our analysis identifies distinct social media engagement patterns via unsupervised learning and applies supervised models for entrepreneurship prediction, with logistic regression outperforming all other algorithms in terms of predictive accuracy and stability. In social media use, the cluster analysis reveals that at K=2, users form tightly packed, well-separated engagement groups. The results indicate that 39.4 percent of respondents believe social media positively impacts the economy by enabling businesses to generate increased revenue. However, only 14 percent of respondents participate in entrepreneurship, highlighting a substantial gap between digital engagement and business adoption. The analysis indicates that daily social media consumption is widespread with YouTube (66.7 percent) and WhatsApp (62.7 percent) being the most frequently used platforms. Key barriers identified are online harassment, limited digital literacy, and cultural constraints in a patriarchal society such as Pakistan. Additionally, 52.9 percent of respondents are unaware of government initiatives supporting women entrepreneurs, indicating limited policy outreach.</description>

      <title>Carrot, stick, or both? Price incentives for sustainable food choice in competitive environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meat consumption is a major driver of global greenhouse gas emissions. While pricing interventions have shown potential to reduce meat intake, previous studies have focused on highly constrained environments with limited consumer choice. Here, we present the first large-scale field experiment to evaluate multiple pricing interventions in a real-world, competitive setting. Using a sequential crossover design with matched menus in a Swiss university campus, we systematically compared vegetarian-meal discounts (-2.5 CHF), meat surcharges (+2.5 CHF), and a combined scheme (-1.2 CHF=+1.2 CHF) across four campus cafeterias. Only the surcharge and combined interventions led to significant increases in vegetarian meal uptake--by 26.4% and 16.6%, respectively--and reduced CO2 emissions per meal by 7.4% and 11.3%, respectively. The surcharge, while effective, triggered a 12.3% drop in sales at intervention sites and a corresponding 14.9% increase in non-treated locations, hence causing a spillover effect that completely offset environmental gains. In contrast, the combined approach achieved meaningful emission reductions without significant effects on overall sales or revenue, making it both effective and economically viable. Notably, pricing interventions were equally effective for both vegetarian-leaning customers and habitual meat-eaters, stimulating change even within entrenched dietary habits. Our results show that balanced pricing strategies can reduce the carbon footprint of realistic food environments, but require coordinated implementation to maximize climate benefits and avoid unintended spillover effects.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Emergence of the EV Industry: A Product Space Analysis Across Regions and Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automotive industry is undergoing transformation, driven by the electrification of powertrains, the rise of software-defined vehicles, and the adoption of circular economy concepts. These trends blur the boundaries between the automotive sector and other industries. Unlike internal combustion engine (ICE) production, where mechanical capabilities dominated, competitiveness in electric vehicle (EV) production increasingly depends on expertise in electronics, batteries, and software. This study investigates whether and how firms' ability to leverage cross-industry diversification contributes to competitive advantage. We develop a country-level product space covering all industries and an industry-specific product space covering over 900 automotive components. This allows us to identify clusters of parts that are exported together, revealing shared manufacturing capabilities. Closeness centrality in the country-level product space, rather than simple proximity, is a strong predictor of where new comparative advantages are likely to emerge. We examine this relationship across industrial sectors to establish patterns of path dependency, diversification and capability formation, and then focus on the EV transition. New strengths in vehicles and aluminium products in the EU are expected to generate 5 and 4.6 times more EV-specific strengths, respectively, than other EV-relevant sectors over the next decade, compared to only 1.6 and 4.5 new strengths in already diversified China. Countries such as South Korea, China, the US and Canada show strong potential for diversification into EV-related products, while established producers in the EU are likely to come under pressure. These findings suggest that the success of the automotive transformation depends on regions' ability to mobilize existing industrial capabilities, particularly in sectors such as machinery and electronic equipment.</description>

      <title>Job insecurity, equilibrium determinacy and E-stability in a New Keynesian model with asymmetric information. Theory and simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13627v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Departing from the dominant approach focused on individual and meso-level determinants, this paper develops a macroeconomic formalization of job insecurity within a New Keynesian framework in which the standard IS-NKPC-Taylor rule block is augmented with labor-market frictions. The model features partially informed private agents who receive a noisy signal about economic fundamentals from a fully informed public sector. When monetary policy satisfies the Taylor principle, the equilibrium is unique and determinate. However, the release of news about current or future fundamentals can generate a "Paradox of Transparency" through general-equilibrium interactions between aggregate demand and monetary policy. When the Taylor principle is violated, belief-driven equilibria may emerge. Validation exercises based on the Simulated Method of Moments support the empirical plausibility of the model's key implications.</description>

      <title>How AI Agents Follow the Herd of AI? Network Effects, History, and Machine Optimism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding decision-making in multi-AI-agent frameworks is crucial for analyzing strategic interactions in network-effect-driven contexts. This study investigates how AI agents navigate network-effect games, where individual payoffs depend on peer participatio--a context underexplored in multi-agent systems despite its real-world prevalence. We introduce a novel workflow design using large language model (LLM)-based agents in repeated decision-making scenarios, systematically manipulating price trajectories (fixed, ascending, descending, random) and network-effect strength. Our key findings include: First, without historical data, agents fail to infer equilibrium. Second, ordered historical sequences (e.g., escalating prices) enable partial convergence under weak network effects but strong effects trigger persistent "AI optimism"--agents overestimate participation despite contradictory evidence. Third, randomized history disrupts convergence entirely, demonstrating that temporal coherence in data shapes LLMs' reasoning, unlike humans. These results highlight a paradigm shift: in AI-mediated systems, equilibrium outcomes depend not just on incentives, but on how history is curated, which is impossible for human.</description>

      <title>Defunding Sexual Healthcare: A Topological Investigation of Resource Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Government actions, such as the Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic Supreme Court ruling and the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, have aimed to restrict or prohibit Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood Healthcare Centers (PPHCs) at both the state and national levels. These funding cuts are particularly harmful in states like California, which has a large population of Medicaid users. This analysis focuses on the distribution of Planned Parenthood clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which offer essential reproductive healthcare services including, but not limited to, abortions, birth control, HIV services, pregnancy testing and planning, STD testing and treatment, and cancer screenings. While expanded funding for FQHCs has been proposed as a solution, it fails to address the locational accessibility of Medicaid-funded health centers that provide sexual and reproductive care. To assess this issue, we analyze the proximity of data points representing California's PPHC and FQHC locations. Topological Data Analysis (TDA)-an approach that examines the shape and structure of data -- is used to detect disparities in reproductive and sexual healthcare coverage. To conduct data collection and visualization, we utilize R and Python. We apply an n-closest neighbor algorithm to examine distances between facilities and assess changes in travel time required to reach healthcare sites. We apply persistent homology to analyze current gaps across multiple scales in healthcare coverage and compare them to potential future gaps. Our findings aim to identify areas where access to care is most vulnerable and demonstrate how TDA can be used to analyze spatial inequalities in public health.</description>

      <title>Anticipatory Governance in Data-Constrained Environments: A Predictive Simulation Framework for Digital Financial Inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial exclusion remains a major barrier to digital public service delivery in resource-constrained and archipelagic nations. Traditional policy evaluations rely on retrospective data, limiting the ex-ante intelligence needed for agile resource allocation. This study introduces a predictive simulation framework to support anticipatory governance within government information systems. Using the UNCDF Pacific Digital Economy dataset of 10,108 respondents, we apply a three-stage pipeline: descriptive profiling, interpretable machine learning, and scenario simulation to forecast outcomes of digital financial literacy interventions before deployment. Leveraging cross-sectional structural associations, the framework projects intervention scenarios as prioritization heuristics rather than causal estimates. A transparent linear regression model with R-squared of 95.9 identifies modifiable policy levers. Simulations indicate that foundational digital capabilities such as device access and expense tracking yield the highest projected gains, up to 5.5 percent, outperforming attitudinal nudges. The model enables precision targeting, highlighting young female caregivers as high-leverage responders while flagging non-responders such as urban professionals to prevent resource misallocation. This research demonstrates how static survey data can be repurposed into actionable policy intelligence, offering a scalable and evidence-based blueprint for embedding predictive analytics into public-sector decision-support systems to advance equity-focused digital governance.</description>

      <title>Economic Shocks, Opportunity Costs, and the Supply of Politicians</title>

Abstract: Adverse economic shocks are known to reshape voter behavior -- the demand side of politics. Much less is known about their consequences for the supply side: how such shocks affect who becomes a politician. This paper examines how job losses influence individuals' decisions to enter politics and the implications for political selection. Using administrative data linking political participation records to matched employer-employee data covering all formal workers in Brazil, and exploiting mass layoffs for causal identification, we find that job loss significantly increases the likelihood of joining a political party and running for local office. Layoff-induced candidates are positively selected on various competence measures, indicating that economic shocks can improve the quality of political entrants. The increase in candidacies is strongest among laid-off individuals with greater financial incentives from holding office and higher predicted income losses. A regression discontinuity design further shows that eligibility for unemployment benefits increases political entry. These results are consistent with a reduction in individuals' opportunity costs -- both in terms of reduced private-sector income and increased time resources -- facilitating greater political engagement.</description>

      <title>Words or Numbers? How Framing Uncertainties Affects Risk Assessment and Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Senders of messages prefer to communicate uncertainty verbally (e.g., something is likely to happen) rather than numerically (such as 75%), leaving receivers with imprecise information. While it is well established that receivers translate verbal probabilities into numerical values that systematically deviate from the intended numerical meaning, it is less clear how this discrepancy influences subsequent behavioral actions. Thus, the role of verbal versus numerical communication of uncertainty warrants additional attention, to investigate two critical questions: 1) whether differences in decision-making under uncertainty arise between these communication forms, and 2) whether such differences persist even when verbal phrases are translated accurately into the intended numerical meaning. By implementing a laboratory experiment, we show that individuals place significantly lower values on uncertain options with medium to high likelihoods when uncertainty is communicated verbally rather than numerically. This effect may lead to less rational decisions under verbal communication, particularly at high likelihoods. Those results remain consistent even if individuals translate verbal uncertainty correctly into the intended numerical uncertainty, implying that a biased behavioral response is not only induced by miscommunication. Instead, ambiguity about the exact meaning of a verbal phrase interferes with decision-making even beyond potential mistranslations. These findings tie in with previous research on ambiguity aversion, which has predominantly operationalized ambiguity through numerical ranges rather than verbal phrases. Based on our findings we conclude that managers should communicate uncertainty numerically, as verbal communication can unintentionally influence the decision-making process of employees.</description>

      <title>Are penalty shootouts better than a coin toss? Evidence from international club football in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Penalty shootouts play an important role in the knockout stage of major football tournaments, especially since the 2021/22 season, when the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) scrapped the away goals rule in its club competitions. Inspired by this rule change, our paper examines whether the outcome of a penalty shootout can be predicted in UEFA club competitions. Based on all shootouts between 2000 and 2025, we find no evidence for the effect of the kicking order, the field of the match, or psychological momentum. In contrast to previous results, stronger teams, defined first by Elo ratings, do not perform better than their weaker opponents. Consequently, penalty shootouts seem to be close to a coin toss in top European club football.</description>

      <title>Rice Price Dynamics during the 1945--1947 Famine in Post-War Taiwan: A Quantitative Reassessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compiled the first high-frequency rice price panel for Taiwan from August 1945 to March 1947, during the transition from Japanese rule to China rule. Using regression models, we found that the pattern of rice price changes could be divided into four stages, each with distinct characteristics. Based on different stages, we combined the policies formulated by the Taiwan government at the time to demonstrate the correlation between rice prices and policies. The research results highlight the dominant role of policy systems in post-war food crises.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Machine Learning? Regularization and Forecast Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard forecast efficiency tests interpret violations as evidence of behavioral bias. We show theoretically and empirically that rational forecasters using optimal regularization systematically violate these tests. Machine learning forecasts show near zero bias at one year horizon, but strong overreaction at two years, consistent with predictions from a model of regularization and measurement noise. We provide three complementary tests: experimental variation in regularization parameters, cross-sectional heterogeneity in firm signal quality, and quasi-experimental evidence from ML adoption around 2013. Technically trained analysts shift sharply toward overreaction post-2013. Our findings suggest reported violations may reflect statistical sophistication rather than cognitive failure.</description>

      <title>Strict universality of the square-root law in price impact across stocks: a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange</title>

Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models (Nature 2003, QJE 2006, and Quant. Finance 2013). Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>

      <title>Major Space Weather Risks Identified via Coupled Physics-Engineering-Economic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space weather poses an important but under-quantified threat to critical infrastructure, the economy, and society. While extreme geomagnetic storms are recognized as potential global catastrophes, their socio-economic impacts remain poorly quantified. Here we present a novel physics-engineering-economic framework that links geophysical drivers of geomagnetic storms to power grid geoelectric fields, transformer vulnerability, and macroeconomic consequences. Using the United States as an example, we estimate daily economic losses from transformer thermal heating of 1.37 billion USD (95 percent confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.58 billion USD) for a 100-year geomagnetic storm, with power outages affecting 4.1 million people and 101,000 businesses. A 250-year event could raise losses to 2.09 billion USD per day (95 percent confidence interval: 1.84 to 2.34 billion USD), disrupting power for more than 6 million people and 155,000 businesses. Crucially, the framework is scalable and transferable, offering a template for assessing space weather risk to critical infrastructure in other countries. This integrative approach provides the first end-to-end quantification of space weather socio-economic impacts, bridging space physics through to policy-relevant metrics. Our results demonstrate that coupled socio-economic modeling of space weather is both feasible and essential, enabling evidence-based decision making in infrastructure protection and global risk management.</description>

      <title>Think, Speak, Decide: Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Economic Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.</description>

      <title>Developing synthetic microdata through machine learning for firm-level business surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public-use microdata samples (PUMS) from the United States (US) Census Bureau on individuals have been available for decades. However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.</description>
