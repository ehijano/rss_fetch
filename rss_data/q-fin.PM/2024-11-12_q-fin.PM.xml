      <title>Schur Complementary Allocation: A Unification of Hierarchical Risk Parity and Minimum Variance Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite many attempts to make optimization-based portfolio construction in the spirit of Markowitz robust and approachable, it is far from universally adopted. Meanwhile, the collection of more heuristic divide-and-conquer approaches was revitalized by Lopez de Prado where Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) was introduced. This paper reveals the hidden connection between these seemingly disparate approaches.</description>

      <title>The lexical ratio: A new perspective on portfolio diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio diversification, traditionally measured through asset correlations and volatilitybased metrics, is fundamental to managing financial risk. However, existing diversification metrics often overlook non-numerical relationships between assets that can impact portfolio stability, particularly during market stresses. This paper introduces the lexical ratio (LR), a novel metric that leverages textual data to capture diversification dimensions absent in standard approaches. By treating each asset as a unique document composed of sectorspecific and financial keywords, the LR evaluates portfolio diversification by distributing these terms across assets, incorporating entropy-based insights from information theory. We thoroughly analyze LR's properties, including scale invariance, concavity, and maximality, demonstrating its theoretical robustness and ability to enhance risk-adjusted portfolio returns. Using empirical tests on S&amp;P 500 portfolios, we compare LR's performance to established metrics such as Markowitz's volatility-based measures and diversification ratios. Our tests reveal LR's superiority in optimizing portfolio returns, especially under varied market conditions. Our findings show that LR aligns with conventional metrics and captures unique diversification aspects, suggesting it is a viable tool for portfolio managers.</description>

      <title>A Fully Analog Pipeline for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a ubiquitous problem in financial mathematics that relies on accurate estimates of covariance matrices for asset returns. However, estimates of pairwise covariance could be better and calculating time-sensitive optimal portfolios is energy-intensive for digital computers. We present an energy-efficient, fast, and fully analog pipeline for solving portfolio optimization problems that overcomes these limitations. The analog paradigm leverages the fundamental principles of physics to recover accurate optimal portfolios in a two-step process. Firstly, we utilize equilibrium propagation, an analog alternative to backpropagation, to train linear autoencoder neural networks to calculate low-rank covariance matrices. Then, analog continuous Hopfield networks output the minimum variance portfolio for a given desired expected return. The entire efficient frontier may then be recovered, and an optimal portfolio selected based on risk appetite.</description>

      <title>Is the annualized compounded return of Medallion over 35%?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a challenge to estimate fund performance by compounded returns. Arguably, it is incorrect to use yearly returns directly for compounding, with reported annualized return of above 60% for Medallion for the 31 years up to 2018. We propose an estimation based on fund sizes and trading profits and obtain a compounded return of 31.8% before fees. Alternatively, we suggest using the manager's wealth as a proxy and arriving at a compounded growth rate of 25.6% for Simons for the 33 years up to 2020. We conclude that the annualized compounded return of Medallion before fees is probably under 35%. Our findings have implications for correctly estimating fund performance.</description>

      <title>Financial Statement Analysis with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can successfully perform financial statement analysis in a way similar to a professional human analyst. We provide standardized and anonymous financial statements to GPT4 and instruct the model to analyze them to determine the direction of firms' future earnings. Even without narrative or industry-specific information, the LLM outperforms financial analysts in its ability to predict earnings changes directionally. The LLM exhibits a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on par with a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM prediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the LLM generates useful narrative insights about a company's future performance. Lastly, our trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield a higher Sharpe ratio and alphas than strategies based on other models. Our results suggest that LLMs may take a central role in analysis and decision-making.</description>
