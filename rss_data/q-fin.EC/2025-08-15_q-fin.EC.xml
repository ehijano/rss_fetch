      <title>Racial bias, colorism, and overcorrection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines whether increased awareness can affect racial bias and colorism. We exploit a natural experiment from the widespread publicity of Price and Wolfers (2010), which intensified scrutiny of racial bias in men's basketball officiating. We investigate refereeing decisions in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), an organization with a long-standing commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). We apply machine learning techniques to predict player race and to measure skin tone. Our empirical strategy exploits the quasi-random assignment of referees to games, combined with high-dimensional fixed effects, to estimate the relationship between referee-player racial and skin tone compositions and foul-calling behavior. We find no racial bias before the intense media coverage. However, we find evidence of overcorrection, whereby a player receives fewer fouls when facing more referees from the opposite race and skin tone. This overcorrection wears off over time, returning to zero-bias levels. We highlight the need to consider baseline levels of bias before applying any prescription with direct relevance to policymakers and organizations given the recent discourse on DEI.</description>

      <title>Public Support for Environmental Regulation: When Ideology Trumps Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When environmental regulations are unpopular, policymakers often attribute resistance to information frictions and poor communication. We test this idea in the context of a major climate policy: Germany's Heating Law of 2023, which mandates the phase-out of fossil fuel heating. Through a survey experiment with property owners, we examine whether providing comprehensive information about the regulation's costs, requirements, and timeline affects adoption decisions and policy support. Despite successfully increasing factual knowledge, information provision has no significant effect on intended technology adoption, policy support, or incentivized measures of climate preferences. Instead, pre-existing environmental preferences and demographic characteristics emerge as the key predictors of responses to the regulation. A feeling that existing systems still work well and cost considerations dominate fossil fuel users' stated reasons for non-adoption, while independence from fossil fuels and perceived contributions to the common good drive adoption among switchers. Our findings suggest that opposition to climate policy stems from fundamental preference heterogeneity rather than information frictions. This has important implications for optimal policy design, highlighting potential limits of information provision in overcoming resistance to environmental regulation. The results also speak to broader questions in political economy about the relationship between knowledge, preferences, and support for policy reform.</description>
