      <title>One-clock synthesis problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalisation of B\"uchi-Landweber games to the timed setting. The winning condition is specified by a non-deterministic timed automaton, and one of the players can elapse time. We perform a systematic study of synthesis problems in all variants of timed games, depending on which player's winning condition is specified, and which player's strategy (or controller, a finite-memory strategy) is sought. As our main result we prove ubiquitous undecidability in all the variants, both for strategy and controller synthesis, already for winning conditions specified by one-clock automata. This strengthens and generalises previously known undecidability results. We also fully characterise those cases where finite memory is sufficient to win, namely existence of a strategy implies existence of a controller. All our results are stated in the timed setting, while analogous results hold in the data setting where one-clock automata are replaced by one-register ones.</description>

      <title>ToolGate: Contract-Grounded and Verified Tool Execution for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with external tools have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools.</description>

      <title>Generalised Quantifiers Based on Rabin-Mostowski Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce new generalised quantifiers which allow us to express the Rabin-Mostowski index of automata. Our main results study expressive power and decidability of the monadic second-order (MSO) logic extended with these quantifiers. We study these problems in the realm of both $\omega$-words and infinite trees. As it turns out, the pictures in these two cases are very different. In the case of $\omega$-words the new quantifiers can be effectively expressed in pure MSO logic. In contrast, in the case of infinite trees, addition of these quantifiers leads to an undecidable formalism.
  To realise index-quantifier elimination, we consider the extension of MSO by game quantifiers. As a tool, we provide a specific quantifier-elimination procedure for them. Moreover, we introduce a novel construction of transducers realising strategies in $\omega$-regular games with monadic parameters.</description>
