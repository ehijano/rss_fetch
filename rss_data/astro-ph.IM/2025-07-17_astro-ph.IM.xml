      <title>SAMPLE -- Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence -- A Method of Collection of Stratospheric Samples Using Balloon-Borne Payload System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth possesses many environmental extremes that mimic conditions on extraterrestrial worlds. The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely resembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation levels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the troposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere remains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore microbial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to astrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in access and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE (Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne payload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them in conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and designed in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main payload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that determines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed during flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control) to monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS trackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once sampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload. Upon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be sent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the presence and nature of collected material.</description>

      <title>SETI Post-Detection Futures: Directions for Technosignature Research and Readiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This white paper highlights the work that is needed to anticipate the challenges and societal impacts of a possible technosignature detection. We recommend practical steps to strengthen NASA's astrobiology agenda, guided by the existing interdisciplinary framework of the SETI PostDetection Hub (est. 2022) at the University of St Andrews (Elliot et al. 2023), which emphasizes comprehensive preparedness across science, society, governance, and communication. NASA can significantly enhance readiness by supporting deep interdisciplinary integration, funding SETI post-detection research infrastructure, and cultivating international collaboration. We outline six key dimensions of readiness-directed evidence-based research: cross-divisional methodologies, humanities and social sciences integration, communication, strategic foresight, and development of resilient global infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Towards sub-milliarcsecond astrometric precision using seeing-limited imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth's atmospheric turbulence degrades the precision of ground-based astrometry. Here we discuss these limitations and propose that, with proper treatment of systematics and by leveraging the many epochs available from the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), seeing-limited observations can reach sub-milliarcsecond precision. Such observations may be instrumental for the detection of Galactic black holes via microlensing. We present our methodology and pipeline for precise astrometric measurements using seeing-limited observations. The method is a variant of Gaia's Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) that include several detrending steps. Tests on 6,500 images of the same field, obtained by KMTNet with typical seeing condition of 1 arcsecond and pixel scale of 0.4 arcsecond, suggest that we can achieve, at the bright end (mag &lt;17), relative proper motion precision of 0.1-0.2 mas/yr, over a baseline of approximately five years, using data from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) site. The precision is estimated using bootstrap simulations and further validated by comparing results from two independent KMTNet telescopes.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous observations of multiple ELVES and SPRITES at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2014, the Pierre Auger Observatory has exploited a dedicated trigger and its very high time resolution to study ELVES and harvest record samples of multiple ELVES using the Fluorescence Detector (FD). In 2017, after extending the readout of trace lengths to 0.9 ms, we started observing other types of light transients from the base of the ionosphere, such as HALOS, which deserved further investigation. In December 2023 and April 2024, we installed two additional cameras (TLECAMs), which allow us to perform simultaneous detection of these transients with higher space resolution and longer integration times. Here, we present our first simultaneous observations of SPRITES and ELVES by both TLECAMs and FD. Furthermore, we describe the Python algorithm based on DBSCAN to automatically detect SPRITES in the videos recorded by our TLECAMs and acquire data efficiently without needing the FD trigger.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Multi-Survey Classification of Light Curves with a Pre-Trained Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of Swin Transformer V2, a pre-trained vision Transformer, for photometric classification in a multi-survey setting by leveraging light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). We evaluate different strategies for integrating data from these surveys and find that a multi-survey architecture which processes them jointly achieves the best performance. These results highlight the importance of modeling survey-specific characteristics and cross-survey interactions, and provide guidance for building scalable classifiers for future time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Dispersion Leverage Coronagraph (DLC): A nulling coronagraph for use on primary objective grating telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Dispersion Leverage Coronagraph (DLC), a novel variation of the Achromatic Interfero Coronagraph (AIC) that is designed for optical systems featuring large, dispersive primary objective gratings. DLC was originally designed for the Diffractive Interfero Coronagraph Exoplanet Resolver (DICER), a notional 20m class infrared space telescope utilizing the enhanced one-dimensional angular resolution of large diffraction gratings in order to discover and characterize near-Earth exoplanets. Here we develop the theoretical foundation for DLC, and apply it to DICER as an example use case. We derive important properties of the DLC system including focal plane transmission maps, stellar leakage, residual optical path difference tolerance, and pointing error/jitter considerations. Ultimately, we found that DLC effectively nulls an on-axis target across the entire spectrum in the focal plane, allowing for 2D/lambda diffraction-limited imaging. It requires asymmetrical fine-guidance tolerances on pointing error/jitter. We work through a benchmark DICER design, explaining the need for a second disperser to reduce background from Zodiacal light, and showing that it could plausibly find and characterize approximately 4 nearby, habitable exoplanets around Sun-like stars in a seven year mission; about 30% of the habitable exoplanets within 8 pc were found in our simulation. The DLC may be useful for any application requiring extremely high resolution, close-companion spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Using deep learning to characterize single-exposure double-line spectroscopic binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing the component spectra of double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) and extracting their stellar parameters is a complex and computationally intensive task that usually requires observations spanning several epochs that represent various orbital phases. This poses an especially significant challenge for large surveys such as Gaia or LAMOST, where the number of available spectra per target is often not enough for a proper spectral disentangling. We present a new approach for characterizing SB2 components from single-exposure spectroscopic observations. The proposed tool uses deep neural networks to extract the stellar parameters of the individual component spectra that comprise the single exposure, without explicitly disentangling them or extracting their radial velocities. The neural networks were trained, tested, and validated using simulated data resembling Gaia RVS spectra, which will be made available to the community in the coming Gaia data releases. We expect our tool to be useful in their analysis.</description>

      <title>THOR: a GPU-accelerated and MPI-parallel radiative transfer code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission and absorption line features are important diagnostics for the physics underlying extragalactic astronomy. The interpretation of observed signatures involves comparing against forward modeled spectra from galaxy formation simulations as well as more simplified geometries, while including the complex scattering radiative transfer (RT) of resonant emission lines. Here, we present thor, a modern C++ radiative transfer code focused initially on resonant emission lines. thor is a high-performance, distributed memory MPI-parallel, multi-target code, running on CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators, yielding large $\sim 10-50\rm{x}$ speed-ups compared to previous CPU-only codes. We support multiple grid-based and gridless data structures, enabling comparisons across different hydrodynamical codes as well as toy model geometries. We demonstrate its science capabilities with a number of example use cases across scales: (i) Lyman-alpha RT on simple shell-like gas distributions; (ii) Lyman-alpha RT applied to a high-resolution, high-redshift $z \sim 6$ cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation; (iii) Lyman-alpha and Magnesium-II halos, i.e. scattering and emission from the circumgalactic medium of $z \simeq 1-2$ galaxies drawn from cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations; (iv) the large-scale cosmic web in gas emission, a $6144^3$ volume-element RT scaling calculation; and (v) synthetic absorption spectra of the Lyman-alpha forest. Extensive verification and benchmarking validates our approach and its computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations of Event Time Series with Sparse Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection, Similarity Search, and Unsupervised Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.</description>

      <title>Impacts and Ejecta in Natural Granular Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With laboratory experiments we investigate the ejecta of low-velocity (~m/s) impacts into multi-scale granular media and compare them against ejecta from impacts into mono-scale media. Impacts are into a 50 cm diameter galvanized washtub filled with fine sand that has larger diameter gravel buried below the surface is filmed with two high-speed cameras. The resulting ejecta curtain consists mainly of fine sand, and has a complex asymmetric structure that depends on the location and interaction of the ejecta with the larger gravel grains mixed into the sand. To characterize the highly heterogeneous ejecta curtain we combine three analysis techniques: Particle tracking measures the ejecta velocities and ejecta angles best in low density regions, while particle image velocimetry (PIV) elucidates average motion in dense regions, and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) which captures directions of motion against a patterned background. We find significant asymmetries in the multi-scale ejecta's velocity distributions and ejection angles compared to the symmetry seen in the ejecta from impacts into mono-scale media. Our experiments show that larger grains under the surface impede and direct ejecta along preferential paths during the impact process.</description>

      <title>Galaxy image simplification using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available. The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of the simplified images is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Granulation signatures in 3D hydrodynamical simulations: evaluating background model performance using a Bayesian nested sampling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the granulation background signal is of vital importance when interpreting the asteroseismic diagnostics of solar-like oscillators. Various descriptions exist in the literature for modelling the surface manifestation of convection, the choice of which affects our interpretations. We aim to evaluate the performance of and preference for various granulation background models for a suite of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of convection across the HR diagram, thereby expanding the number of simulations and coverage of parameter space for which such studies have been made. We take a statistical approach by considering the granulation in power density spectra of 3D simulations, where no biases or systematics of observational origin are present. To properly contrast the performance of the models, we develop a Bayesian nested sampling framework for model inference and comparison. This framework was extended to real stellar data using KIC 8006161 (Doris) and the Sun. We find that multi-component models are consistently preferred over a single-component model, with each tested multi-component model demonstrating merit in specific cases. This occurs for simulations with no magnetic activity, thus ruling out stellar faculae as the sole source of the second granulation component. Like a previous study, we find that a hybrid model with a single overall amplitude and two characteristic frequencies performs well for numerous simulations. Additionally, a tentative third granulation component beyond the value of $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ is seen for some simulations, but its potential presence in observations requires further efforts. Studying the granulation signatures in these simulations paves the way to studying stars with accurate granulation models. This deeper understanding of the granulation signal may lead to complementary methods to existing algorithms for determining stellar parameters.</description>

Abstract: On July 1st 2025 the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered, with an eccentricity of $e=6.15 \pm 0.01$ and perihelion of $q=1.357\pm0.001$ au. We report our initial visible to near-infrared (420-1000 nm) spectrophotometry of 3I/ATLAS using both the Palomar 200 inch telescope and Apache Point Observatory. We measure 3I/ATLAS to have a red spectral slope of 19 %/100 nm in the 420-700 nm range, and a more neutral 6 %/100 nm slope over 700-1000 nm. We detect no notable emission features such as from C$_2$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography II: completing galaxy catalogs for gravitational-wave cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation.</description>

      <title>Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations. As largely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis into the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be technological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest' resolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches surprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\lesssim 0.005$\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity. The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\sim{5.9} \times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.</description>

      <title>Bridging Literature and the Universe Via A Multi-Agent Large Language Model System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/w1zLpm_CaWA. The complete system and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/xwzhang98/SimAgents.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Light Beam Shape Characterization using Interferometric Closure Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique using closure amplitudes, inspired by radio interferometry, to determine with high angular resolution the two-dimensional profile of a light beam using an interferogram from a non-redundantly masked aperture. Previous techniques have required multiple interferograms or accurate estimates of the non-uniform illuminations across the aperture. In contrast, our method using closure amplitudes avoids the need to estimate the aperture illuminations while determining the two-dimensional beam shape from a single interferogram. The invariance of closure amplitudes to even time-varying aperture illuminations makes it suitable to longer averaging intervals, with potential to reducing data rates and computational overheads. By using data from the ALBA synchrotron light source to validate the method and its results against existing methods, this paper represents the first real-world application of closure amplitudes to directly determine the light beam's profile using optical interferometry in the high angular resolution regime.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference of microlensed gravitational waves using neural spline flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When gravitational waves (GWs) propagate near massive objects, they undergo gravitational lensing that imprints lens model dependent modulations on the waveform. This effect provides a powerful tool for cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, conventional Bayesian parameter inference methods for GWs are computationally expensive, especially for lensed events with additional lens parameters, necessitating more efficient approaches. In this work, we explore the use of neural spline flows (NSFs) for posterior inference of microlensed GWs, and successfully apply NSFs to the inference of 11-dimensional lens parameters. Our results demonstrate that compared with traditional methods like Bilby dynesty that rely on Bayesian inference, the NSF network we built not only achieves inference accuracy comparable to traditional methods for the main parameters, but also can reduce the inference time from approximately 3 days to 0.8 s on average. Additionally, the network exhibits strong generalization for the spin parameters of GW sources. It is anticipated to become a powerful tool for future low-latency searches for lensed GW signals.</description>

      <title>A waveform and time digitization mainboard prototype for the hybrid digital optical module of TRIDENT neutrino experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The TRIDENT (Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope) experiment is a next-generation underwater neutrino observatory planned for deployment in the West Pacific Ocean, designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation. The full-scale detector will consist of approximately 1000 vertical strings, each equipped with 20 hybrid digital optical modules (hDOMs) containing both photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for comprehensive light detection. This paper presents a custom-designed digitization mainboard prototype for the hDOM, featuring simultaneous 32-channel PMT waveform digitization at 125 MS/s using commercial analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and 56-channel high-precision time measurement through field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-implemented time-to-digital converters (TDCs). The system demonstrates excellent performance in single photoelectron (SPE) detection with clear pedestal separation, maintains linear response up to 240 PEs, and achieves sub-nanosecond timing resolution for PMT or SiPM pulse edges.</description>
