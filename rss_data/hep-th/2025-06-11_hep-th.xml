      <title>Perturbative K\"ahler Moduli Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present two classes of inflationary models in the framework of type IIB string theory. The inflatons correspond to blow-up K\"ahler modulus arising from compactifying type IIB on a Calabi-Yau. Using perturbative corrections, we first highlight a procedure for stabilising more than one K\"ahler modulus. For the case of two K\"ahler moduli, we explicitly construct two class of inflationary potentials within the K\"ahler cone which satisfy both EFT and cosmological constraints. The first class of models, arising from moduli redefinition of the blow-up mode, have a potential of the form $V(\phi)=V_0(1+C_1 \phi^{2/3})$ align with CMB data with scalar-to-tensor ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-2}$. The second class of models, which have been recently proposed in the name of loop blow-up inflation, have a form $V(\phi)=V_0(1+C_2\phi^{-2/3})$ also agrees with CMB data with scalar-to tensor-ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>The $\mathcal{W}$-algebra bootstrap of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6d (2,0) SCFTs of type $\mathfrak{g}$ have protected subsectors that were conjectured in arxiv:1404.1079 to be captured by $\mathcal{W}_\mathfrak{g}$ algebras. We write down the crossing equations for mixed four-point functions $\langle S_{k_1} S_{k_2}S_{k_3}S_{k_4}\rangle$ of 1/2-BPS operators $S_{k_i}$ in 6d (2,0) theories and detail how a certain twist reduces this system to a 2d meromorphic CFT multi-correlator bootstrap problem. We identify the relevant 6d (2,0) $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of type $\mathfrak{g} = \{A_{N-1},D_N\}$ as truncations of $\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$ and solve OPE associativity conditions for their structure constants, both using $\texttt{OPEdefs}$ and the holomorphic bootstrap of arxiv:1503.07111. With this, we solve the multi-correlator bootstrap for twisted 6d four-point correlators $\mathcal{F}_{k_1k_2k_3k_4}$ involving all $S_{k_i}$ up to $\{k_i\}=4$ and extract closed-form expressions for 6d OPE coefficients. We describe the implications of our CFT data on conformal Regge trajectories of the (2,0) theories and finally, demonstrate the consistency of our results with protected higher-derivative corrections to graviton scattering in M-theory on $AdS_7\times S^4/\mathbb{Z}_\mathfrak{o}$.</description>

      <title>Compact Temporal Geometry and the $T^2$ Framework for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-dimensional temporal framework in which time is represented by a compact manifold $T^2 = (t_1, t_2)$, with $t_1$ encoding classical causal structure and $t_2$ representing quantum coherence. This construction unifies unitary evolution, decoherence, measurement collapse, and gravitational dynamics within a consistent geometric and algebraic formalism. Compactification of the coherence time $t_2$ yields a minimal temporal resolution $\Delta t_2 \sim \sqrt{\alpha'}$, leading to a discretized spectrum of temporal modes and regularized ultraviolet behavior in quantum field theory and string-theoretic gravity. We formulate an extended Schr\"odinger equation and generalized Lindblad dynamics on $T^2$, and demonstrate the compatibility of this structure with local gauge symmetry through a complexified BRST quantization procedure. Using para-Hermitian geometry and generalized complex structures, we derive a covariant formulation of temporal T-duality that accommodates both Lorentzian and Euclidean signatures. The $T^2$ framework provides new insights into modular thermodynamics, black hole entropy, and the emergence of classical time from quantum coherence, offering a compact and quantized model of temporal geometry rooted in string theory and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Modular resurgence, $q$-Pochhammer symbols, and quantum operators from mirror curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the results of [1,2], we study the resurgence of $q$-Pochhammer symbols and determine their summability and quantum modularity properties. We construct a new, infinite family of pairs of modular resurgent series from the asymptotic expansions of sums of $q$-Pochhammer symbols weighted by suitable Dirichlet characters. These weighted sums fit into the modular resurgence paradigm and provide further evidence supporting our conjectures in [1]. In the context of the topological string/spectral theory correspondence for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, Kashaev and Mari\~no proved that the spectral traces of canonical quantum operators associated with local weighted projective planes can be expressed as sums of $q$-Pochhammer symbols. Exploiting this relation, we show that an exact strong-weak resurgent symmetry, first observed by the second author in [3] and fully formalized in [2] for local $\mathbb{P}^2$, applies to all local $\mathbb{P}^{m,n}$, albeit stripped of some of the underlying number-theoretic properties. Under some assumptions, these properties are restored when considering linear combinations of the spectral traces that reproduce the weighted sums above.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider the well known infrared divergence (IRD) in QED from the various graphs and relate with the electromagnetic fluctuation etc. based on the Fock space formalism.

      <title>Non-Abelian orbifolds of the SO(32) heterotic string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian toroidal heterotic orbifolds have received comparatively little attention, mainly because of the significant computational challenges they pose, even at the level of computing their matter spectrum. Similarly, the SO(32) heterotic string remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we provide some useful tools to handle this situation. We find that certain non-Abelian orbifolds can be studied using the techniques that are common to Abelian compactifications. In such cases, we show how to compute the gauge groups and massless matter spectrum for non-Abelian orbifolds of the SO(32) heterotic string with standard embedding. A general feature of these constructions is the reduction of the rank of the gauge group. Our findings motivate further research on non-Abelian orbifolds with non-standard embedding, where realistic, rank-reduced models are expected to emerge.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Laurent expansion of rational functions using p-adic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for reconstructing Laurent expansion of rational functions using $p$-adic numbers. By evaluating the rational functions in $p$-adic fields rather than finite fields, it is possible to probe the expansion coefficients simultaneously, enabling their reconstruction from a single set of evaluations. Compared with the reconstruction of the full expression, constructing the Laurent expansion to the first few orders significantly reduces the required computational resources. Our method can handle expansions with respect to more than one variables simultaneously. Among possible applications, we anticipate that our method can be used to simplify the integration-by-parts reduction of Feynman integrals in cutting-edge calculations.</description>

      <title>Superconformal Weight Shifting Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for constructing superconformal blocks for correlators of general supermultiplets in theories with $SU(m,m|2n)$ symmetry, such as four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}\!=\!2$ and $\mathcal{N} \!=\! 4$ conformal theories. We use analytic superspace, viewed as the super-Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(m|n,2m|2n)$, which includes 4D Minkowski space ($m=2,n=0$). In this formalism, superblocks for non-half-BPS correlators are analogous to non-supersymmetric conformal blocks for correlators of fields with spin. We construct $SU(m,m|2n)$-covariant differential operators which generalise the existing conformal weight-shifting operators, and thus allow us to derive all superconformal blocks from the known half-BPS blocks. Our results provide a framework from which to advance the conformal bootstrap in 4D supersymmetric settings, with potential extensions to lower and higher-dimensional SCFTs. The Grassmannian formalism is also seen to offer a natural and often simpler alternative to the embedding space formalism of non-supersymmetric CFTs.</description>

      <title>Khovanov-Rozansky cycle calculus for bipartite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite calculus is a direct generalization of Kauffman planar expansion from $N=2$ to arbitrary $N$, applicable to the restricted class of knots which are entirely made of antiparallel lock tangles. Whenever applicable, it allows a straightforward generalization of the Khovanov calculus without a need of the technically complicated matrix factorization used for arbitrary $N$ in the Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) approach. The main object here is the $3^{n}$-dimensional hypercube with $n$ being the number of bipartite vertices. Maps, differentials, complex and Poincar\'e polynomials are straightforward and indeed reproduce the Khovanov-Rozansky polynomials in the known cases. This provides a great simplification of the Khovanov-Rozansky calculus on the bipartite locus, what can make it an accessible tool for the study of superpolynomials.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent z. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of K-complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral non-Abelian domain walls in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study chiral non-Abelian domain walls in a phase of unconventional vacua of dense QCD. The phase is characterized by asymmetric vacuum-expectation values (VEVs), for example with the left scalar field, corresponding to the left quark-quark condensate, having a nonvanishing VEV and the right field having a vanishing one. The domain wall soliton interpolates between this vacuum and another where the left and right scalar fields switch roles. We contemplate that such vacua could possibly be generated non-perturbatively at very high densities in QCD. Using a strong-coupling, or sigma-model limit, we are able to reduce the full dynamical complex matrix valued equations of motion to the sine-Gordon, a generalization of the sine-Gordon and a generalization of the double sine-Gordon equations. In this limit, we prove nonexistence of domain walls in one of the vacua studied here and we find full numerical computations to converge to the sigma-model limit for many cases, with some exceptions that we discuss.</description>

      <title>One loop corrections to the thermodynamics of near-extremal Kerr-(A)dS black holes from Heun equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute one-loop corrections to the euclidean gravitational path integral of near-extremal (anti-)de Sitter-Kerr black hole in terms of the connection coefficients of the Heun equation describing the black hole linear perturbations in the Teukolsky formalism. We show that different near-extremal limits lead to distinct physical properties of the gravitational configuration, as they get described by distinct limiting differential equations. As a result, the light modes emerging in the limit determine different scaling properties in the temperature of the one-loop determinants. We show that the cold case displays distinctive universal log(T) corrections to the entropy of the system, including the ultracold regime. On the contrary, these do not appear in the limit in which the event horizon superimposes onto the cosmological one. In the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case, a further check is performed by comparison with the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev formula.</description>

      <title>DSR-relativistic spacetime picture and the phenomenology of Planck-scale-modified time dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most active area of research in quantum-gravity phenomenology investigates the possibility of Planck-scale-modified dispersion relations, focusing mainly on two alternative scenarios: the "LIV" scenario, characterized by a specific mechanism of breakdown of relativistic symmetries, and the "DSR" scenario, which preserves overall relativistic invariance but with deformed laws of relativistic transformation. Two recent studies of modified dispersion relations, one relying on Finsler geometry and one based on heuristic reasoning, raised the possibility of potentially observable effects for time dilation and argued that this might apply also to the LIV and DSR scenarios. We observe that the description of Lorentz transformations in the LIV scenario is such that time dilation cannot be modified. The DSR scenario allows for modifications of time dilation, and establishing their magnitude required us to obtain novel results on the effects of finite DSR boosts in the spacetime sector, with results showing in particular that the modification of time dilation is too small for experimental testing.</description>

      <title>Generalised Orbifolds and G-equivariantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a construction motivated by topological field theory, a so-called orbifold datum $\mathbb{A}$ in a ribbon category $C$ allows one to define a new ribbon category $C_{\mathbb{A}}$. If $C$ is the neutral component of a $G$-crossed ribbon category $B$, and $\mathbb{A}$ is an orbifold datum in $C$ defined in terms of $B$, one finds that $C_{\mathbb{A}}$ is equivalent to the equivariantisation $B^G$ of $B$ as a ribbon category. We give a constructive proof of this equivalence.</description>

      <title>2-Group Symmetries of 3-dimensional Defect TQFTs and Their Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large class of symmetries of topological quantum field theories is naturally described by functors into higher categories of topological defects. Here we study 2-group symmetries of 3-dimensional TQFTs. We explain that these symmetries can be gauged to produce new TQFTs iff certain defects satisfy the axioms of orbifold data. In the special case of Reshetikhin-Turaev theories coming from $G$-crossed braided fusion categories $\mathcal C^\times_G$, we show that there are 0- and 1-form symmetries which have no obstructions to gauging. We prove that gauging the 0-form $G$-symmetry on the neutral component $\mathcal C_e$ of $\mathcal C^\times_G$ produces its equivariantisation $(\mathcal C^\times_G)^G$, which in turn features a generalised symmetry whose gauging recovers $\mathcal C_e$. If $G$ is commutative, the latter symmetry reduces to a 1-form symmetry involving the Pontryagin dual group.</description>

      <title>GW170817 Viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation Compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate several Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models that are compatible with the GW170817 event, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the BICEP/Keck updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider two distinct classes of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories, which are equally successful for GW170817-compatible model building and we examine their viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The two models are distinct since the first class relates directly the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function with the scalar potential and yields $c_T^2=1$ while in the second class, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function and the scalar potential are freely but conveniently chosen and the class of models respects the constraint $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| &lt; 6 \times 10^{-15}$. We provide several examples of models belonging to both the two classes of GW170817-compatible Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories and we demonstrate that Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories provide a promising theoretical framework for inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Universality on thermodynamic relation with corrections in Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity Black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized thermodynamic extremum relation, as proposed by Goon and Penco, establishes a novel theoretical framework for the study of spacetime thermodynamics. However, extant investigations generally assume that the black hole state parameter is solely a first-order function of the perturbation parameter when exploring the Goon-Penco relation in diverse spacetime contexts. An analytic expression for the perturbation parameter as a function of the black hole entropy can be expressed by treating the black hole mass as constant. The present study addresses this limitation and provides insight into the universal Goon-Penco relation when multiple thermodynamic state parameters behave as higher order functions of the perturbation parameters. Notably, we have not only established a universal relational formula in the case of multiple state variables, but more importantly, we have put forward an innovative conjecture that reveals the existence of a universal relation between displaced thermodynamic quantities in spacetime in the context of an arbitrary black hole. These theoretical breakthroughs are expected to open up new exploration directions for quantum gravity research.</description>

      <title>Behaviour of $\alpha$-attractors in Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation have remained one of the preferred inflationary models for nearly a decade now. The unique attractor nature of these models in the $n_s-r$ plane have put these models in the sweet-spot of the $n_s-r$ measurement of Planck observations. In this article, we analyse the behaviour of such attractor models in a Warm Inflation setup to investigate whether the attractor nature of these models can be retained even when the dynamics deviates from the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. We have chosen to analyse these models in a strongly dissipative Warm inflation setup, namely the Minimal Warm Inflation, as in such a setup the inflationary dynamics significantly departs from the standard Cold inflation dynamics. We observe that the departure from the standard Cold inflation dynamics destroys the unique attractor nature of such models. The analysis clearly indicates that the attractor nature of these $\alpha$-attractor models is quite unique to the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. However, on a positive note, the analysis indicates that the $\alpha$-attractor models may be made in tune with the recent ACT results in Warm inflation for certain parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</description>

      <title>Vacuum birefringence and the Schwinger effect in (3+1) de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.08977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In de Sitter space, the current induced by an electric field in vacuum is known to feature certain peculiarities, such as infrared hyperconductivity for light bosons in weak electric fields. Moreover, negative conductivity has been claimed to occur for light bosons in moderate electric fields, and for fermions of any mass in electric fields below a certain threshold. Furthemore, in the limit of large mass and weak electric field, the current contains terms which are not exponentially suppressed, contrary to the semiclassical intuition. Here we explain these behaviors, showing that most of the reported negative conductivity is spurious. First, we show that the terms which are not exponentially suppressed follow precisely from the local Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian (suitably generalized to curved space). Thus, such terms are unrelated to pair creation or to the transport of electric charge. Rather, they correspond to non-linearities of the electric field (responsible in particular for vacuum birefringence). The remaining contributions are exponentially suppressed and correspond to the creation of Schwinger pairs. Second, we argue that for light carriers the negative term in the regularized current does not correspond to a negative conductivity, but to the logarithmic running of the electric coupling constant, up to the high energy Hubble scale. We conclude that none of the above mentioned negative contributions can cause an instability such as the spontaneous growth of an electric field in de Sitter, at least within the weak coupling regime. Third, we provide a heuristic derivation of infrared hyperconductivity, which clarifies its possible role in magnetogenesis scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00770v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Form factors of self-dual gauge theory are equal to correlators of an (extended) celestial chiral algebra. This suggests that these form factors can be computed using the "bootstrap" method familiar from 2d CFTs. The method can also be applied to certain QCD amplitudes, which are built from form-factors of self-dual gauge theory.
  In this paper this bootstrap method is applied to compute two-loop all-plus QCD amplitudes, for $SU(N)$ gauge theory with certain special matter content. A closed formula is presented for all single-trace amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Bulk reconstruction for anti-symmetric and symmetric gauge fields: $p$-forms and the graviton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the HKLL bulk reconstruction procedure for $p-$form fields and graviton in empty AdS$_{d + 1}$. We derive spacelike bulk reconstruction kernels for the $p$-forms and the graviton in the Poinarc\'e patch of AdS$_{d+1}$. The kernels are first derived via a mode-sum approach in arbitrary even dimensions. The appropriate AdS-covariant fields are identified and the corresponding kernels obtained via the mode sum approach for these fields. We present arguments for casting these kernels in terms of the AdS chordal distance. Introducing an antipodal-like mapping, the kernels are cast in a spacelike form. An alternative derivation is presented for these kernels, by using a chordal Green's function approach. From the asymptotic expansion of the bulk fields and using Green's theorem, we determine the spacelike kernels for both mode of $p-$forms and the graviton, which are show to agree with the kernels obtained by the mode-sum approach. The massive $p-$form fields, as well as the relevant Brietenlohner-Freedman bounds are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological numbers for the rotating, accelerating neutral black hole and its AdS extension, as well as the rotating, accelerating charged black hole and its AdS extension. We find that the topological number of an asymptotically flat accelerating black hole consistently differs by one from that of its non-accelerating counterpart. Furthermore, we show that for an asymptotically AdS accelerating black hole, the topological number is reduced by one compared to its non-accelerating AdS counterpart. In addition, we demonstrate that within the framework of general relativity, the acceleration parameter and the negative cosmological constant each independently add one to the topological number. However, when both factors are present, their effects neutralize each other, resulting in no overall change to the topological number.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product CFTs and One-Character Extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one-character CFTs obtained as one-character extensions of the tensor products of a single CFT $\mathcal{C}$. The motivation comes from the fact that $28$ of the $71$ CFTs in the Schelleken's list of $c = 24$ CFTs are such CFTs. We study for $\mathcal{C}$ : (i) any two-character WZW CFT with vanishing Wronskian index, (ii) the Ising CFT, (iii) the infinite class of $D_{r,1}$ CFTs and the $A_{4,1}$ CFT. The characters being $S$-invariant homogenous polynomials of the characters of $\mathcal{C}$, when organised in terms of a $S$-invariant basis, take compact forms allowing for closed form answers for high central charges. We find a $S$-invariant basis for each of the CFTs studied. As an example, one can find an explicit expression for the character of the monster CFT as a degree-$48$ polynomial of the characters of the Ising CFT. In some CFTs, some of the $S$-invariant polynomials of characters compute, after using the $q$-series of the characters, to a constant value. Hence, the characters of one-character extensions are more properly elements of the quotient ring of polynomials (of characters) with the ideal needed for the quotient, generated by $S$-invariant polynomials that compute to a constant. In some cases, we are able to rule out the existence of one-character extension CFTs. In other cases, we predict their existence. We are able to conjecture a discrete set of six and four infinite series of one-character extension CFTs.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals exhibit linear resistivity and anomalous Hall transport, yet a comprehensive theory that accounts for both phenomena is still lacking. Recent studies have shown SYK-like spatially random couplings between a Fermi surface and a bosonic field, either scalar or vector type, can yield linear-$T$ resistivity. In this paper, we continue the investigation on a vector coupling in the presence of a magnetic field. We compute the fermion and boson propagators, along with the self-energy and polarization functions, and determine their dependence on the magnetic field. Although the Hall angle does not exhibit the signature of strange-metal, the linear-in-temperature resistivity remains at low temperatures. Results indicate that random interactions can robustly support linear transport, though additional ingredients may be required to capture the full phenomenology of strange metals.</description>

Abstract: We extend the holographic mean-field theory to rank-two symmetric tensor order parameter field coupled with fermion. We classify the roles of symmetric tensor order according to the effect on the spectral density: cone-angle change, squashing, and tilting of the spectral light cones. The over-tilted light cone is also achieved in a generalized prescription, which consistently preserves the causality condition. Our results provide agreements between the holographic spectra with those observed in real materials, such as type-II Dirac cones and strained graphene.</description>

      <title>Scale without Conformal Invariance in bottom-up Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In holography, the isometry group of the bulk spacetime corresponds to the symmetries of the boundary theory. We thus approach the question of whether (and when) scale invariance in combination with Poincar\'e invariance implies full conformal invariance in quantum field theory from a holographic bulk perspective. To do so, we study bulk spacetimes that include a warped extra dimension and in which the isometry group corresponds to scale without conformal invariance. Firstly, we show that the bulk Weyl tensor plays a pivotal role in distinguishing those metrics exhibiting conformal invariance (Weyl=0) from those merely exhibiting scale invariance (Weyl$\neq$0). Based on this, we then prove the following theorem: For putative boundary theories with $n\geq2$ dimensions, the bulk metric can not exhibit scale without conformal invariance if its warped extra dimension is compact and the null energy condition is required to hold. For $n=1$, we discuss that a more general ansatz for the bulk metric must be made, a detailed analysis of which is left for future research.</description>

Abstract: A Lagrange multiplier field can be used to restrict radiative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action to one-loop order. This result is employed to show that it is possible to couple a scalar field to the metric (graviton) field in such a way that the model is both renormalizable and unitary. The usual Einstein equations of motion for the gravitational field are recovered, perturbatively, in the classical limit. By evaluating the generating functional of proper Green's functions in closed form, one obtains a novel analytic contribution to the effective action.</description>

      <title>On world-sheet S-matrix of NSR string in static gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As was shown in arXiv:1203.1054, expanding the Nambu action near the "long string" vacuum in the static gauge one finds that the one-loop 2 to 2 scattering amplitude of the $D-2=24$ transverse 2d fluctuations $X^i$ is given by a pure phase expression consistent with underlying integrability. Similar computation in the Green-Schwarz superstring was carried out in arXiv:2404.09658. Here we consider the case of the NSR string starting with its manifestly 2d covariant action given by $D$ scalar multiplets coupled to 2d supergravity. Eliminating the zweibein and gravitino fields is non-trivial, and a Nambu-like formulation of the spinning string involving only scalar coordinates and their 2d fermionic partners has not previously been available. We show how the auxiliary fields can be eliminated in static gauge after a specific choice of superconformal gauge for the fermions, while keeping the transverse fields $X^i$ and $\psi^i$ off-shell. The resulting one-loop S-matrix for $X^i$ is found, as expected, to be the same as in the GS superstring case. We also discuss similar actions for the heterotic string and a $T\bar T$ deformation of free 2d scalar multiplet.</description>

Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating PBHs is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function and induced gravitational waves (GWs) with such non-Gaussianities. When the PBH abundance is fixed, non-Gaussianity only has mild impact on the spectral shape of the induced GWs, which gives relatively robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Connections I: Differential Cocycles for Principal Groupoid Bundles with Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on principal bundles with connection as morphisms from the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold to a classifying dg-Lie groupoid. This groupoid can be identified with a lift of the inner homomorphisms groupoid arising in \v{S}evera's differentiation procedure of Lie quasi-groupoids. Our new perspective readily extends to principal groupoid bundles, but requires an adjustment, an additional datum familiar from higher gauge theory. We show that for Lie groupoids, the additional adjustment data amounts to a Cartan connection. The resulting adjusted connections naturally provide a global formulation of the kinematical data of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories as described by Kotov-Strobl (arXiv:1510.07654) and Fischer (arXiv:2104.02175).</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity I: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the degrees of freedom of new general relativity. This theory is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In this work, we focus on unveiling the degrees of freedom of the physically interesting types of NGR: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8, which contain the gravitational propagating degrees of freedom. First, we revisit the theory based on the gauge approach to gravity and reformulate the Lagrangian of the theory. Second, we review the irreducible decomposition of the theory while focusing on the Hamiltonian and the primary constraints in each type. Third, we perform the Dirac-Bergmann analysis to unveil the degrees of freedom of the theory in the case of Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. We find a novel new behavior of constraints in Type 8, which is classified as second-class but not to determine any Lagrange multipliers and to provide the gauge invariance of the theory under the satisfaction of a specific condition of the multipliers. The degrees of freedom of Type 2, Type 3, and Type 5 are unveiled as six, five, and seven, respectively. The degrees of freedom of Type 8 is either four under a specific condition to the Lagrange multipliers or six in the generic case. Finally, we conclude this work with five future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the \textit{chiral anomaly}. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting Berry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\chi$, or (2) two distinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Searching for the classical version of Hawking radiation and screening of Coulomb field by the horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the existence of a classical version of Hawking radiation - solutions to classical field equations that consist solely of outgoing waves, in the spacetime of a collapsing black hole. The non-static nature of the corresponding metric results in the absence of energy conservation for matter, which could otherwise a priori prohibit such solutions. A specific and simple scenario is considered: a black hole formation as a result of the collapse of a thin shell, which is not necessarily dust-like. In the corresponding spacetime, we study solutions of the equations for a real massless scalar field that take the form of purely outgoing waves. In addition to the homogeneous equation, we also examine the case of a constant point source of the field located at the symmetry center. The general solution outside the shell is expressed in terms of the confluent Heun function, while the equations inside the shell and the matching conditions at its surface are formulated as an integral equation. The analysis of various solution asymptotics enables the reduction of the integral equation to a matrix equation, which is subsequently solved numerically.</description>

      <title>Ringdown nonlinearities in the eikonal regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eikonal limit of black hole quasinormal modes (the large multipole limit $\ell \gg 1$) can be realized geometrically as a next-to-leading order solution to the geometric optics approximation, and also as linear fluctuations about the Penrose limit plane wave adapted to the lightring. Extending this interpretation beyond the linear order in perturbation theory requires a robust understanding of quadratic quasinormal modes for large values of $\ell$. We analyze numerically the relative excitation of quadratic to linear quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black holes, with two independent methods. Our results suggest that the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes for the $\ell \times \ell \to 2\ell$ channel converges towards a finite value for large $\ell$, in sharp contrast with a recent proposal inspired by the Penrose limit perspective. On the other hand, the $2 \times \ell \to \ell + 2$ channel seems to have a linearly growing ratio. Nevertheless, we show that there is no breakdown of black hole perturbation theory for physically realistic initial data.</description>

      <title>Perturbative and non-linear analyses of gravitational turbulence in spacetimes with stable light rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some black hole mimickers, as well as black strings and other higher-dimensional spacetimes, exhibit stable light rings-regions where light or high-frequency gravitational waves can be trapped. In these regions, linear perturbations decay slowly, raising the possibility of nonlinear instability mechanisms. In this work, we study the cubic nonlinear wave equation as a proxy for Einstein's equations, using a four-dimensional model geometry that allows stable trapping. By employing a perturbative approach, we show that the nonlinear wave equation on the sphere with dissipative terms captures several features of the full nonlinear problem. This framework allows us to confirm a previous conjecture: all higher-order energy norms grow for arbitrarily small initial fluctuation amplitudes. Additionally, we analyze the system's mode spectrum at late times, revealing an inertial range dominated by a direct energy cascade. These findings further support the notion that spacetimes with stable light rings develop weak, high-frequency radiation hair, which will not generically lead to instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of finite spin quark density on the chiral and deconfinement thermal crossovers using numerical simulations of lattice QCD with two dynamical light quarks. The finite spin density is introduced by the quark spin potential in the canonical formulation of the spin operator. We show that both chiral and deconfinement temperatures are decreasing functions of the spin potential. We determine the parabolic curvatures of crossover temperatures in a limit of physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>Effects of superradiance on relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in the studies of structured states obtained in relativistic electron beams has highlighted the use of two alternative descriptions, each based on a different wavefunction and the related space-time density. Although both wavefunctions obey the Dirac equation (one directly and the other through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation) they lead to different dynamics and properties, such as the presence or absence of spin-orbit interactions. In this work we investigate wavepacket dynamics for the Klein-Gordon equation, which displays the same ambiguity regarding the choice of different densities, in a setting involving Klein tunneling across a series of supercritical potential barriers. Relying on the superradiant character of this setting, we obtain solutions to the wavepacket dynamics indicating that the density based on a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the wavefunction can be locally amplified outside the light-cone. In principle, the exponential increase of the charge due to the field inhomogeneities can lead to an arbitrarily large amplification over macroscopic distances. These results question the interpretation of the Foldy-Wouthuysen density as a fundamentally correct probability or charge density.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers. Code availability:The implementation is open-source at https://github.com/GenliangLi/MatBYIB.</description>
