      <title>Ordering the topological order in the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possible topological order/topological quantum field theory of different quantum Hall systems. Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly. Specifically, the one-form global symmetry and its anomaly are presented as the organizing principle of these systems. This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.</description>

      <title>Monopoles, Dirac strings and Magnetic Noise in Model Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Dirac string formalism for monopoles we expose an extensive analogy between magnetic monopole excitations in the dumbbell model of spin ice and those of the vacuum. In both cases the Dirac strings are defined in the space-time of monopole trajectories which are simulated in spin ice using transition graphs between initial and final configurations. The Stanford experiment for Dirac monopole detection is reconstructed in spin ice using the fragmentation procedure. The setup is then extended to simulate magnetic noise experiments using stochastic dynamics. It is shown that the noise from the monopoles and their constraining strings can be separated and that the correlated signal over long times comes largely from the constraining strings rather than from the monopoles themselves.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the hydrogen-induced insulator-metal transition through artificial microstructure engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-associated filling-controlled Mottronics within electron-correlated system provides a groundbreaking paradigm to explore exotic physical functionality and phenomena. Dynamically controlling hydrogen-induced phase transitions through external fields offers a promising route for designing protonic devices in multidisciplinary fields, but faces high-speed bottlenecks owing to slow bulk diffusion of hydrogens. Here, we present a promising pathway to kinetically expedite hydrogen-related Mott transition in correlated VO2 system by taking advantage of artificial microstructure design. Typically, inclined domain boundary configuration and cR-faceted preferential orientation simultaneously realized in VO2/Al2O3 (102) heterostructure significantly lower the diffusion barrier via creating an unobstructed conduit for hydrogen diffusion. As a result, the achievable switching speed through hydrogenation outperforms that of counterpart grown on widely-reported c-plane Al2O3 substrate by 2-3 times, with resistive switching concurrently improved by an order of magnitude. Of particular interest, an anomalous uphill hydrogen diffusion observed for VO2 with a highway for hydrogen diffusion fundamentally deviates from basic Fick's law, unveiling a deterministic role of hydrogen spatial distribution in tailoring electronic state evolution. The present work not only provides a versatile strategy for manipulating ionic evolution, endowing with great potential in designing high-speed protonic devices, but also deepens the understanding of hydrogen-induced Mott transitions in electron-correlated system.</description>

      <title>Subgap pumping of antiferromagnetic Mott insulators: photoexcitation mechanisms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the 2D repulsive Hubbard model on a square lattice at half filling, under strong driving with ac electric fields, by employing a time-dependent Gaussian variational approach. Within the same theoretical framework, we analytically obtain the conventional Keldysh crossover between multiphoton and tunneling photoexcitation mechanisms, as well as two new regimes beyond the Keldysh paradigm. We discuss how dynamical renormalization of the Mott-Hubbard gap feeds back into the photoexcitation process, modulating the carrier generation rate in real time. The momentum distribution of quasiparticle excitations immediately after the drive is calculated, and shown to contain valuable information about the generation mechanism. Finally, we discuss experimental probing of the pump-induced nonequilibrium electronic state.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum phases with electric fields in one-dimensional Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems under electric fields provide a powerful framework for uncovering and controlling novel quantum phases, especially in low-dimensional systems with strong correlations. In this work, we investigate quantum phase transitions induced by an electric potential difference in a one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard chain. By analyzing (i) tunneling and pairing mechanisms, (ii) charge and spin gaps, and (iii) entanglement between the chain halves, we identify three distinct phases: Mott insulator, metal and band-like insulator. The metallic regime, characterized by the closing of both charge and spin gaps, is accompanied by a field-dependent kinetic energy and a quasi-periodic oscillatory behavior of pairing response and entanglement. Although the metallic phase persists for different magnetizations, its extent in the phase diagram shrinks as spin polarization increases.</description>

      <title>Mott transition and correlation effects on strictly localized states in an octagonal quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band systems have attracted significant attention as platforms for studying strongly correlated electron physics, where the dominance of electron-electron interactions over kinetic energy gives rise to a variety of emergent phenomena. Quasicrystals are compelling systems for studying these phenomena as they host degenerate strictly localized states at zero energy due to perfect destructive interference patterns. In this study, we use the slave-rotor mean-field approach to investigate the effects of electron interactions within the Hubbard model on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal. The phase diagram characterizing metallic and Mott insulator regions indicates a first-order phase transition. Our analysis shows that the local coordination number affects the local quasiparticle weight, displaying varying metallicity across the sites. Furthermore, we focus on the strictly localized states that arise in the non-interacting limit. We find that interactions and deviation from particle-hole symmetry induce spectral splitting, broadening, and partial delocalization of the localized states, depending on the local environment. In particular, certain localized states with higher coordination numbers remain more robust compared to others. Our results highlight the critical role of local geometry in shaping correlation effects in flat-band quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Coupling quantum spin ice to matter on the centered pyrochlore lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy physics of quantum spin ice is known to support an emergent form of quantum electrodynamics (QED), where magnetic monopoles exist and the fine structure constant is material dependent. In this article, we show how this QED is modified via a coupling to dynamical matter on the centered pyrochlore lattice, a structure which has recently been synthesized using metal-organic frameworks. Specifically, we study the low-energy properties of the S = 1/2 quantum XXZ model on the centered pyrochlore lattice. At fourth order in degenerate perturbation theory, this model hosts a quantum spin liquid distinct from the well-known U(1) quantum spin ice on the pyrochlore due to the presence of dynamical matter in the ground state. Exact diagonalization results are consistent with this quantum spin liquid over an extended region of the ground state phase diagram although potential quantum critical points within this region could indicate a richer phase structure. Our work thus expands the physics of quantum spin ice in an experimentally motivated geometry, providing the framework for understanding how the emergent QED behaves in the presence of dynamical matter.</description>

      <title>Electric-Magnetic Duality for Symmetric Tensor Gauge Theories and Immobile $p$-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11174v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study electric-magnetic duality in Lorentz invariant symmetric tensor gauge theories, where immobile charged particles - fractons - arise due to the generalized current conservation $\partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} J^{\mu \nu} = 0$ and the fracton gauge principle. We show that the duality in the symmetric gauge theories holds only in four-dimensional spacetime. In higher dimensions, the duality does not hold with only the symmetric gauge fields but tensor fields with more complex symmetries come into play. Furthermore, we show that a hierarchy for the symmetric gauge field theories of higher ranks is interpreted by the bi-form calculus. We also discuss the restricted immobility of $p$-branes in the mixed symmetric gauge theories. As a byproduct, we find that novel self-duality conditions are defined as BPS equations in the four-dimensional Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Bell sampling in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are essential for the numerical study of large-scale quantum many-body systems, yet their utility has been significantly hampered by the difficulty in computing key quantities such as off-diagonal operators and entanglement. This work introduces Bell-QMC, a novel QMC framework leveraging Bell sampling, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. We demonstrate that Bell-QMC enables an efficient and unbiased estimation of both challenging classes of observables, offering a significant advantage over previous QMC approaches. Notably, the entanglement across all system partitions can be computed in a single Bell-QMC simulation. We implement this method within the stochastic series expansion (SSE), where we design an efficient update scheme for sampling the configurations in the Bell basis. We demonstrate our algorithm in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, extracting universal quantum features using only simple diagonal measurements. This work establishes Bell-QMC as a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in QMC simulations, providing an exponential advantage over conventional QMC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-helix states are exact eigenstates of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ Heisenberg chain characterized by spatially modulated spin textures appearing under special parameter conditions. In this work, we generalize this framework and construct exact spin helix eigenstates in the fully anisotropic XYZ Heisenberg model, extending to higher spatial dimensions and spin representations, which reveals new stabilization mechanisms beyond integrability. The XXZ and XY limits are also analyzed to clarify the properties and constraints of these spin helix eigenstates. Our results broaden the class of analytically tractable exact eigenstates in quantum spin systems and deepen understanding of spatially inhomogeneous states in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By formulating the renormalization group as a quantum channel acting on density matrices in Quantum Field Theories (QFTs), we show that ground-state expectation values of observables supported on slow momentum modes can be approximated by their averages on the fixed-point theories to which the QFTs flow. This is done by studying the fidelity between ground states of different QFTs and arriving at certain hyperscaling relations satisfied at criticality. Our results allow for a clear identification of cases in which one can replace a QFT by its scale-invariant limit in the calculation of expectation values, opening the way for the application of numerical and analytical methods to as of yet difficult computer simulation of critical models.</description>

      <title>Dissipative phase transition of interacting non-reciprocal fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an interacting fermionic chain in the presence of non-reciprocal gain and loss processes obtained via reservoir engineering. The interplay between unitary evolution and the two dissipative processes leads to distinct non-reciprocal signatures in the transient dynamics and the steady state. These include a transition from exponential to power-law relaxation towards a finite-density steady-state, a nonzero particle current from breaking inversion symmetry, and dynamics under open boundary conditions showing directionality and charge accumulation. Weak interactions preserve the main signatures of non-reciprocity, enriching the interacting many-body non-reciprocal phase with volume law entanglement of quantum trajectories. Upon increasing the interaction above a critical value, we find a dissipative phase transition where reciprocity is dynamically restored.</description>

      <title>Linear scaling relation between two-dimensional massless Dirac fermion Fermi velocity and Fe-As bond length in iron arsenide superconductor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) massless Dirac fermions (MDF), which represent a type of quasi-particles with linear energy-momentum dispersions only in 2D momentum space, provide a fertile ground for realizing novel quantum phenomena. However, 2D MDF were seldom observed in the superconducting bulk states of 3D materials. Furthermore, as a cornerstone for accurately tuning the quantum phenomena based on 2D MDF, a quantitative relationship between 2D MDF and a structural parameter has rarely been revealed so far. Here, we report magneto-infrared spectroscopy studies of the iron-arsenide-superconductor systems NaFeAs and $A\mathrm{Fe_2As_2} (A = \mathrm{Ca, Ba})$ at temperature $T \sim 4.2 $ K and at magnetic fields ($B$) up to 17.5 T. Our results demonstrate the existence of 2D MDF in the superconducting bulk state of NaFeAs. Moreover, the 2D-MDF Fermi velocities in NaFeAs and $A\mathrm{Fe_2As_2} (A = \mathrm{Ca, Ba})$, which are extracted from the slopes of the linear $\sqrt{B}$ dependences of the Landau-level transition energies, scale linearly with the Fe-As bond lengths. The linear scaling between the 2D-MDF Fermi velocities and the Fe-As bond lengths is supported by (i) the linear relationship between the square root of the effective mass of the $d_{xy}$ electrons and the Fe-As bond length and (ii) the linear dependence of the square root of the calculated tight-binding hopping energy on the Fe-As bond length. Our results open up new avenues for exploring and tuning novel quantum phenomena based on 2D MDF in the superconducting bulk states of 3D materials.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Superconductivity Mediated by Majorana Fermions in the Kitaev-Kondo Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity usually emerges from a metallic normal state which follows the Fermi-liquid paradigm. If, in contrast, the normal state is a fractionalized non-Fermi liquid, then pairing may either eliminate fractionalization via a Higgs-type mechanism leading to a conventional superconducting state, or pairing can occur in the presence of fractionalization. Here we discuss a simple model for the latter case: Using a combination of perturbation theory and functional renormalization group, we show that the Kitaev--Kondo lattice model displays a fractionalized superconducting phase at weak Kondo coupling. This phase is characterized by Cooper pairing of conventional electronic quasiparticles, coexisting with a spin-liquid background and topological order. Depending on the sign of the Kitaev coupling, we find the pairing to be either of chiral $d$-wave or $p$-wave type for extended doping regions around the van-Hove filling. We discuss applications and extensions.</description>

Abstract: We study an interacting spinless quadratic band touching model that realizes a topological Mott insulating state. We quench the interaction from a value corresponding to the nematic insulator to that of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) ordered phase. We perform time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulations and show that after the quench the system realizes an excited Dirac semimetal state, which is however unstable and spontaneously evolves to a state with inhomogeneous nematic and QAH order parameters. The modulations form a stripe pattern that grows exponentially with time until the local Chern marker reaches unity. The alternating QAH order defines a domain structure with boundaries that host chiral sublattice currents.</description>

      <title>Landau Instability and soliton formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider at a finite temperature $T$ a superfluid moving with a velocity $v$ relative to the thermal bath or its normal component. From Landau's argument there exists a critical $v_c (T)$ beyond which excitations can be spontaneously generated and the system becomes unstable. Identifying the final state induced by such an instability has been an outstanding open question. Using holographic duality we perform dynamical simulations of evolutions from initial unstable states, and find that the system settles to a homogenous superfluid state with a final velocity below the critical velocity. The dynamical evolution process appears to be highly chaotic, exhibiting transient turbulence. Nevertheless we are able to identify from the simulations a universal physical mechanism for the reduction of superfluid velocity, in terms of spontaneous nucleation of solitons. We also derive a simple analytic formula which relates the final velocity to the number of solitons nucleated during the evolution.</description>

      <title>Vortical currents and reciprocal relations for transport coefficients in the electron hydrodynamic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06375v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <title>Fractional-statistics-induced entanglement from Andreev-like tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of anyonic statistics stands as a cornerstone in the landscape of topological quantum techniques. While recent years have brought forth encouraging and persuasive strides in detecting anyons, a significant facet remains unexplored, especially in view of connecting anyonic physics to quantum information platforms -- whether and how entanglement can be generated by anyonic braiding. Here, we demonstrate that even when two anyonic subsystems (represented by anyonic beams) are connected only by electron tunneling, entanglement between them, manifesting fractional statistics, is generated. To demonstrate this physics, we rely on a platform where fractional quantum Hall edges are bridged by a quantum point contact that allows only transmission of fermions (so-called Andreev-like tunneling). This invokes the physics of two-beam collisions in an anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel collider, accompanied by a process that we dub anyon-quasihole braiding. We define an entanglement pointer -- a current-noise-based function tailored to quantify entanglement associated with quasiparticle fractional statistics. Our work, which exposes, both in theory and in experiment, entanglement associated with anyonic statistics and braiding, prospectively paves the way to the exploration of entanglement induced by non-Abelian statistics.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and localization in random and time-periodic unitary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the growth and saturation of Krylov spread (K-) complexity under random quantum circuits. In Haar-random unitary evolution, we show that, for large system sizes, K-complexity grows linearly before saturating at a late-time value of $D/2$, where $D$ is the Hilbert space dimension, at timescales $\sim D$. Our numerical analysis encompasses two classes of random circuits: brick-wall random unitary circuits and Floquet random circuits. In brick-wall case, K-complexity exhibits dynamics consistent with Haar-random unitary evolution, while the inclusion of measurements significantly slows its growth down. For Floquet random circuits, we show that localized phases lead to reduced late-time saturation values of K-complexity, forbye we utilize these saturation values to probe the transition between thermal and many-body localized phases.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>

      <title>Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.</description>
