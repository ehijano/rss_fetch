      <title>NASDUCK': Laboratory Limits on Ultralight Dark-Photon Dark Matter with Null-Axis Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark photon is a well-motivated ultralight dark-matter candidate that may couple to the Standard Model through kinetic mixing. We search for dark-photon dark matter in the mass range $m_{A'}c^2 = 4\times10^{-12}$-$2\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$ (1-500 kHz) using a three-axis magnetometer inside a large conductive shielded room. We set new laboratory limits on the kinetic-mixing parameter $\epsilon$, improving upon previous laboratory bounds by up to three orders of magnitude. Our search exploits a geometry-defined null response along one axis as a noise reference; a subtraction procedure reduces the noise floor and improves sensitivity. These results establish the strongest laboratory constraints in this mass range and illustrate how null-axis magnetometry can broaden terrestrial searches for ultralight vector dark matter.</description>

      <title>Non-anomalous axions: lessons from the Majoron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that when an anomalous and a non-anomalous global symmetries are spontaneously and simultaneously broken, the resulting Nambu--Goldstone boson is associated with the non-anomalous one. Applied to the Majoron, this implies that its underlying symmetry is $B-L$ rather than $L$, naturally resolving the domain wall problem. This result further demonstrates that effective couplings of the form $a \, F \, \tilde{F}$ do not uniquely indicate an anomalous origin, allowing the detection of non-anomalous Nambu--Goldstone bosons, such as the Majoron, in searches for axion--gauge boson interactions, potentially serving as evidence for the existence of new charged fermions.</description>

      <title>One Sum To Rule Them All: A Second Order Master Rate Sum Rule for Charm Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that within the Standard Model any system of hadronic weak charm decays related by $U$-spin satisfies the following rate sum rule: (sum of CF and DCS CKM-free rates) divided by (sum of SCS CKM-free rates) = 1, which holds up to second order in $U$-spin breaking. We test this sum rule against available data and find that it is well satisfied in all cases. For systems in which some decay rates have not yet been measured, we use this sum rule to predict the missing rates.</description>

      <title>Robust Calibration of Non-Perturbative Models with History Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply, for the first time, Bayes Linear Emulation and History Matching to the calibration of non-perturbative models in Monte Carlo event generators. In contrast to the usual approach of "Monte Carlo tuning", History Matching does not result in best-fit plus ellipsoidal parameter uncertainty estimates but instead identifies all parameter space regions that are consistent with data. This approach leads to a systematic and robust quantification of parametric uncertainties in the models, especially in those challenging cases where different, possibly disjoint, regions of parameter space deliver similar results, which are usually not properly treated with current methodology. We highlight the power of this method with the hadronisation models available through Sherpa: the built-in cluster fragmentation Ahadic and string fragmentation through an interface to Pythia.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation for Hard Partons in a Gluonic Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a fluctuation dissipation relation connecting the drag and diffusion jet transport coefficients for an energetic light quark traversing a non-perturbative thermalized gluon plasma. The hard quark is taken to be close to on-shell, with an energy scale parametrically larger than the medium temperature. We introduce a general complex-valued function for each transport coefficient. Evaluating these in the deep Euclidean momentum region enables their expression in terms of local operators. Using contour-integration techniques, we relate these local operators, after vacuum subtraction, to the physical transport coefficients that arise along a branch cut, close to light-like dispersion. The derived relation relates the longitudinal drag coefficient to the longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients, a $4^{\rm th}$ order fluctuation, and the thermal gluon condensate.</description>

      <title>Flavorful Lepton Number Violation at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of detecting flavorful lepton number violation at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) through resonant production of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), resulting in $e^- p \to \ell^+_\alpha + k\, j+X$, where $\alpha \in \{e, \mu, \tau \}$ and $k$ denotes the number of jets. We work in the $\nu$SMEFT framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory augmented with $n$ singlet HNLs, one of which is in the mass range $10-100$~GeV, within kinematic reach of the EIC. To explore the EIC sensitivity, we focus on the HNL production mechanism induced by mixing with light neutrinos. We study kinematic distributions for signal and backgrounds, including hadronization and detector effects, and suggest a set of cuts to minimize backgrounds. In the mass range considered, we find that the EIC with muon detection capabilities and an integrated luminosity of $100~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ can reach sensitivities comparable to the strongest direct (LHC) and indirect constraints, and is especially relevant in the $\nu$SMEFT framework beyond dimension four. Our study motivates further assessment of muon detection capabilities at the EIC and $\tau$ hadronic reconstruction, as well as a more general theoretical analysis involving production mechanisms mediated by higher-dimensional operators in the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Current-carrying string network evolution in an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are topological defects arising in a variety of cosmological scenarios, as the Universe undergoes symmetry-breaking phase transitions, whose discovery would offer valuable insight into the high-energy physics that shaped the early Universe. To interpret such a detection, robust theoretical models are essential. The Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model is particularly prominent: it self-consistently treats the network as a thermodynamic system, characterizing its key properties, and predicting its large-scale evolution. This has recently been extended to include superconducting cosmic strings, which carry additional degrees of freedom, giving rise to the Charge-Velocity dependent One-Scale (CVOS) model. One limitation of the latter model is that it only included loss mechanisms for the charge and current. Here, we extend this model by phenomenologically including a possible energy source mechanism, specifically by allowing current-carrying strings interactions with an external magnetic field. We discuss how this coupling impacts the network's evolution, present and classify the physically allowed scaling solutions for this extended CVOS model, and comment on the different impacts of the external magnetic field on the evolution of the network's charge and current. Under our modeling assumptions, one of the ten physically plausible scaling solution enables the network to gain energy by this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in atoms and electron scattering revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange by two neutrinos (as well as by other fermions) generates a long-range parity-violating (PV) potential of the form $\sim G^2/r^5$, with characteristic range $\hbar/(2m_{\nu}c)$. This interaction produces a $-0.8\%$ correction to the effective weak charge of the Cs atom, thereby resolving the $2\sigma$ discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction and the Cs PV measurement, and yielding $\sin^2\theta_W=0.2375(19)$ at $q^2\approx0$ (to be compared with the Standard Model value $\sin^2\theta_W=0.2387$). We derive updated limits on an extra $Z'$ boson and obtain a constraint on isospin-conserving oblique radiative corrections characterized by the Peskin--Takeuchi parameter, $S=-0.32(53)$ at $q^2\approx0$. The corresponding relative correction to the proton weak charge is $3\%$, and a similar correction is expected for the electron weak charge.</description>

      <title>ACT-Consistent B-L Higgs Inflation in Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a renormalizable extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) endowed by an R and a gauged B - L symmetry. The model incorporates chaotic inflation driven by a quartic potential, associated with the Higgs superfields which lead to a spontaneous breaking of U(1)B-L. Consistency with the ACT data is achieved by considering a fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potential which includes two free parameters (p,N) constrained in the ranges 1.355&lt;p&lt;6.7 and 6x10^-5&lt;N&lt;0.7. An explanation of the mu term of the MSSM is also provided, under the condition that a related parameter in the superpotential is somewhat small. Baryogenesis occurs via non-thermal leptogenesis which is also realized by the inflaton's decay to the lightest and/or next-to-lightest right-handed neutrinos for normal ordered light neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Charmed nuclei and exotic charmed meson production at CBM@FAIR and ALICE@LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make predictions for the expected multiplicities of exotic charmed hadrons and charmed nuclei in Au+Au collisions at SIS100 and LHC beam energies, using input on light hadron and charm production from the UrQMD transport model, and applying the Thermal-FIST model. We demonstrate that the CBM experiment has the capability to explore these states with production rates of one per 3 seconds for $\chi_{c0}(1P)$ and $\chi_{c1}(1P)$, and one every 3 minutes for $X(3872)$ at the expected data taking rates. Due to the higher baryon density at CBM compared to the LHC, charmed nuclei, if they exist, will be equally abundant at CBM as at the LHC, even though the total charm production at CBM is much lower.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram of two color QCD under influence of baryon density ($\mu_B$), isospin ($\mu_I$), chiral ($\mu_5$ and $\nu_5$) imbalances is investigated within the framework NJL model approach. This letter establishes the existence of weak dualities in two color quark matter--symmetries revealed when full thermodynamic potential is projected or restricted to specific condensation channels. These dualities provide a unified understanding of two interesting phenomena in the phase diagram: universal catalysis and chameleon effect of chiral chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Testing beyond the Standard Model scenarios in next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we assess the sensitivity of next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE, T2HK, and T2HKK, to three popular beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. Within the three BSM studies, we examine: (i) long-range neutrino-matter interactions induced by flavor-dependent, anomaly-free gauged baryon-lepton symmetries mediated by ultra-light vector boson, showing that DUNE and T2HK can constrain, discover, and in some favorable cases distinguish among different symmetries; (ii) Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), where we derive analytical dependencies of CPT-conserving and CPT-violating LIV parameters on baseline and energy, highlighting the superior reach of DUNE in probing all the LIV parameters, in contrast to T2HK, which is essentially blind to the CPT-conserving LIV parameters; and (iii) active-sterile oscillations over a broad range of $\Delta m^2_{41}$, where we derive sensitivity to CP phases for benchmark choices of $\Delta m^2_{41}$ and establish exclusion limits, emphasizing the role of near detectors. Together, these studies show that future long-baseline facilities not only resolve the neutrino mass ordering, value of $\delta_{\rm CP}$, and $\theta_{23}$ octant, but also provide powerful probes of BSM physics.</description>

      <title>Bottom-charmed meson states in inverse problem of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the bottom-charmed ($B_c$) meson spectrum within the inverse matrix QCD sum rules formalism. In this framework, conventional QCD sum rules are recast as an inverse problem, allowing for the direct reconstruction of hadronic spectral densities from first principles without invoking phenomenological continuum parametrizations or quark-hadron duality assumptions. We compute the masses and decay constants of conventional $B_c$ mesons with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-$, $1^-$, $0^+$, and $1^+$. The obtained results are in close agreement with available experimental measurements and are consistent with predictions from various theoretical and phenomenological approaches. The inverse matrix formulation exhibits improved numerical stability and reduced systematic uncertainties relative to standard implementations, highlighting its suitability for precision spectroscopy of heavy quarkonium systems.</description>

      <title>Isospin symmetry breaking and the mass of the QCD axion in a three-flavor linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of the ground state of QCD manifests itself through the dependence of its potential energy density on the CP-violating angle $\Theta$. This is computed in the present note within a three-flavor linear meson model. It is shown that the isospin symmetry breaking condensate leads to a 5\% shift in the scale of topological fluctuations, due to which a value emerges in close agreement with lattice QCD determinations. Transparent analytical computation makes explicit the physical content of each step significantly correcting the starting crude estimate of topological susceptibility and eventually achieving the quite accurate final result. This clear physical interpretation lends also a certain pedagogical value to the proposed treatment.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD corrections to hadron production in DIS at finite transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete calculation of hadron production in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at finite transverse momentum to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD. To overcome the long-standing challenge of infrared divergences in semi-inclusive processes with identified final state hadrons at finite transverse momentum, we implement the recently developed $q_T$-subtraction framework based on the recoil-free jet definition. By utilizing the winner-take-all recombination scheme, we achieve a consistent factorization for hadron-jet associated production, enabling the inclusion of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ corrections. Our results demonstrate a significantly improved stabilization of the perturbative expansion and a reduction in scale uncertainties compared to previous next-to-leading order predictions. We find that the NNLO corrections are essential for a robust description of high precision multiplicity data from the ZEUS collaborations. This work provides a high precision theoretical foundation for the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider era and establishes a new benchmark for the exploration of the nucleon's three-dimensional structure.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Non-Holomorphic Modular $A_4$ Linear Seesaw Framework Testable at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a realization of neutrino masses within the linear seesaw mechanism based on non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry, extending modular-invariant flavor models beyond the conventional holomorphic framework. The model is constructed in a non-supersymmetric setting and involves six heavy $SU(2)_L$ singlet fermions, $N_R$ and $S_L$, together with a single flavon field, thereby significantly reducing the field content. The modular transformation properties of the Yukawa couplings under $A_4$ symmetry lead to a highly constrained neutrino mass matrix with a distinctive flavor structure. After presenting the general theoretical framework, we perform a systematic numerical analysis of neutrino phenomenology by restricting the modulus parameter $\tau$ to the fundamental domain and scanning the allowed parameter space. We identify regions consistent with current neutrino oscillation data at the $3\sigma$ level and obtain predictions for currently unknown observables, including the absolute neutrino mass scale and leptonic CP-violating phases. We further examine the implications for neutrinoless double beta decay, highlighting testable signatures in upcoming precision oscillation and rare-process experiments. These results demonstrate the phenomenological viability and predictive power of non-holomorphic modular symmetry in linear seesaw neutrino mass models.</description>

      <title>Ruling Out Spiky WIMP Dark Matter using Indirect Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) density profile in the innermost region of the Galaxy remains an open question. In particular, while adiabatic growth of the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^\ast$ at the Galactic Center (GC) can induce a 'spike' in central DM density, the existence of such a spike is still under debate. Here we present new constraints on the spike slope $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ using conventional DM indirect detection searches. We first recast existing photon and neutrino line searches, which include the contribution from the GC region, into constraints on the thermally-averaged DM annihilation cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ in the presence of a DM spike. We then derive new bounds on the spike profile for a generic Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) DM scenario, where the thermal freeze-out mechanism fixes the annihilation cross-section at $\langle\sigma v\rangle\sim (2-3) \times 10^{-26}~{\rm cm}^3~{\rm s}^{-1}$. We find that for DM annihilation to photons, constraints from Fermi-LAT and MAGIC rule out spike profiles at the GC for a broad range of WIMP DM masses from 10 GeV to 100 TeV. Our result holds even if the photon channel constitutes only $1\%$ of the total annihilation rate. For the neutrino channel, we use the IceCube data to constrain the existence of an extremely steep spike in the $\mathscr{O}(1-10)$ TeV DM mass range. Our analysis can be easily extended to other annihilation channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light crossing dark domain walls that source a top form coupled to gauge Chern--Simons terms mixing visible and dark $U(1)$ gauge fields generically converts into dark photons. The effect is entirely localized on the wall and requires no additional ingredients. The conversion rate is a sharp function of the photon frequency in the wall rest frame, vanishing above the ultraviolet cutoff of the top form sector. Partial cloaking may also induce a rotation of the polarization of transmitted light of order $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3}$ radians, modify the cosmic microwave background power spectrum, and violate Etherington's reciprocity relation at low frequencies. These effects can impact cosmological determinations of the Hubble rate.</description>

      <title>Detector-level assessment of alternative target nuclei for CEvNS experiments under realistic experimental conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) provides a sensitive probe of neutrino interactions at low momentum transfer, but its experimental observation is strongly constrained by detector-related effects such as energy threshold, resolution, noise, and event-selection criteria. In this work, we perform a detector-level assessment of CEvNS nuclear recoil observability under realistic experimental conditions, with particular emphasis on the role of detector response in shaping measurable recoil spectra. Using detailed Geant4-based simulations, CEvNS interactions are modeled for a set of alternative target nuclei spanning light to intermediate mass ranges. The true nuclear recoil energy distributions are propagated through a simplified yet realistic detector-response chain incorporating energy smearing, noise-induced fluctuations, threshold cuts, and veto-based event selection. We present a systematic analysis of recoil energy spectra before and after detector effects, response matrices linking true and reconstructed energies, and energy-dependent selection efficiencies. The results demonstrate that detector response effects significantly modify the observable CEvNS signal, particularly in the near-threshold region where most recoil events are concentrated. Differences in efficiency turn-on behavior and reconstructed energy distributions highlight the target-nucleus dependence of CEvNS observability under identical detector conditions. Rather than focusing on absolute event-rate predictions, this study emphasizes the relative impact of detector effects on signal accessibility and target performance. The presented framework provides a consistent methodology for evaluating and comparing prospective CEvNS target materials at the detector level, offering practical guidance for future low-threshold CEvNS experiments and detector design optimization.</description>

      <title>AGN Feedback and the Development of Dusty Multiphase Gas in X-ray Emitting Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the physical and kinematic properties of dust-rich regions in a small sample of group-centered elliptical galaxies, emphasizing their connection with the hot X-ray emitting gas and detailed dust grain characteristics. Comprehensive multi-wavelength data, including H-alpha and CO emission detected by MUSE and ALMA, demonstrate the presence of dust clouds embedded within complex, hot X-ray atmospheres shaped by AGN feedback. X-ray images show bubbles and cavities surrounded by bright rims. We find that dust regions containing molecular gas traced by CO are preferentially located at the rims of these X-ray cavities, suggesting that AGN-driven outflows enhance the condensation of cold, dusty gas at these compressive interfaces. Kinematic measurements indicate that molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically and spatially linked, supporting the framework of a multiphase medium arising from the top-down condensation rain in the hot plasma and related chaotic cold accretion. Crucially, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv show that regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emission coincide exhibit notably smaller Rv values, implying steeper extinction curves and the predominance of smaller or less evolved dust grains within these mixed-phase environments. This contrasts with larger Rv values found elsewhere in the dust clouds, suggesting grain growth or survival mechanisms within shielded cold gas.</description>

      <title>The shape of transverse momentum spectra in hybrid hydrodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scaled transverse momentum spectra over a wide parameter space of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation models in order to learn what information can be obtained from the shape of identified-particle spectra -- previously observed to be surprisingly universal across centrality and collision systems in both experimental data and hydrodynamic simulations. We study its sensitivity to each of 17 model parameters in the context of 4 different models for particlization when switching from the hydro description to the kinetic theory afterburner. We find that the strongest sensitivity is to parameters relating to bulk viscosity, free-streaming time, and the $\texttt{T$_\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$ nucleon width parameter $w$. However, we find that the model generally has surprisingly little flexibility in describing the scaled spectrum observable, despite the large number of parameters.
  Within this small range of parameter dependence, we further find significant tension in a simultaneous description of momentum-integrated observables. In particular, while the mean transverse momentum prefers a large value of the nucleon width parameter $w$, a small value is required to obtain scaled spectra that are consistent with experimental measurements. We speculate on the origin of these model tensions and possible missing physics in the commonly-used $\texttt{T$_\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$+free streaming+hydro+afterburner simulation model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the two-particle cumulant in pp, d-Au, and Au-Au collisions. The two-particle cumulant was treated as an event-by-event distribution, and its skewness and kurtosis were analyzed. The non-flow correlations, like jets and decays, constantly produced a skewed distribution, regardless of the model used. On the contrary, HYDJET++ produced a smooth Gaussian distribution at higher $\eta$ windows in fixed impact parameter collisions. The skewness increased consistently for higher $\eta$ windows in all non-QGP models like PYTHIA, PHOJET, QGSJET, and DPMJET. The kurtosis of the distribution also increased with $\eta$ windows in non-QGP models. The skewness and kurtosis of the distributions produced by HYDJET++ decreased with $\Delta\eta$ and eventually reached zero at higher $\Delta\eta$.</description>

      <title>Space-time regions of high baryon density and baryon stopping in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-volumes ($V_4=$ spatial-3-volume$\times$lifetime) are calculated within the model of three-fluid dynamics (3FD) and compared with those of the the JET AA Microscopic Transport Model (JAM). The calculations are performed for central Au+Au collisions at energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 -- 19.6 GeV. These $V_4$ indicate optimal collision-energy ranges for realizing macroscopic high baryon-density matter. It is found that the 3FD four-volumes noticeably exceed those in the JAM, which indicates a stronger baryon stopping in the 3FD model as compared to that JAM. It is argued that this difference in the baryon stopping correlates with stiffness of the EoS implemented in these models. Contrary to JAM, the four-volume, where a baryon density ($n_B$) exceeds three times the normal nuclear density ($n_0$), does not exhibit a maximum as a function of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. It decreases monotonically with increasing $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, remaining at a fairly macroscopic level (i.e. $V_4\geq 5.5^4$ fm$^4$/c). For higher baryon densities, $V_4$ exhibits maxima in its dependence on $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The optimal energy range for densities $n_B/n_0&gt;$ 4 is located at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2--8 GeV. Even for $n_B/n_0&gt;$ 6, the four-volume remains quite macroscopic ($V_4\geq 4^4$ fm$^4$/c) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 4.5--9 GeV contrary to the JAM.</description>

      <title>Magnetized BPS lumps in the $CP^1$ model with Maxwell coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) topological configurations in the $CP^1$ model minimally coupled to a Maxwell gauge field. Starting from the nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model, we explicitly construct its classical mapping to the $CP^1$ formulation, emphasizing the emergence of a local $U(1)$ gauge symmetry intrinsically linked to the Fubini-Study target-space geometry. Focusing on the static sector, we analyze magnetized BPS lump configurations. By examining the topological boundary conditions, we show that the magnetic flux is quantized and fully determined by the asymptotic behavior of the gauge field. Within the BPS framework, we identify the specific self-interaction potential required for the existence of self-dual configurations. A detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior, both near the lump core and at spatial infinity, demonstrates that finite-energy solutions necessarily correspond to lump-like BPS configurations in the $CP^1$ target space, with the scalar field vanishing asymptotically. The resulting BPS equations are solved numerically, and the main physical properties of the solutions are presented. We find that these configurations are regular, magnetically localized, and energetically stable, with their internal structure rigidly controlled by the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space. In contrast to Abelian Higgs vortices, the configurations discussed here do not rely on spontaneous symmetry breaking but arise purely from the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate {the arrival time and the Faraday rotation} of extragalactic electromagnetic signals from fast radio bursts (FRBs) propagating through chiral cosmic media within the framework of Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw {(MCFJ)} electrodynamics. By treating the interstellar medium as a cold, ionized chiral plasma, {we derive} the time delay between two traveling signals, expressing it in terms of modified dispersion measures (DMs) {containing chiral contributions}. {The Faraday rotation angle is then} written in terms of modified rotation measures (RMs). By combining the DMs and redshift data from a set of FRBs, {we obtain} constraints on the chiral parameter magnitude at the order of $10^{-26}$--$10^{-24}$ GeV. {Using the Faraday} rotation formulae and RM measurements, {upper bounds as stringent as $10^{-43}$ GeV on the MCFJ parameters are also obtained.}</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamics of the $SU(4)$ gauge theory with a single flavor of fundamental quarks is analyzed on the lattice with dynamical fermion simulations, which is the low-energy sector of a realistic, strongly-interacting dark matter model -- the Hyper Stealth Dark Matter. The gravitational wave spectrum from the first-order confinement transition in the early universe is further calculated, where the effect of the dark sea quarks, which decrease the interface tension in the effective potential of the Polyakov loop, is shown numerically to lower the gravitational wave amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of resonance form factors in effective field theory as well as on the lattice is a highly challenging task. In a recent paper, we proposed a novel method based on the introduction of a background field and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem to address the problem, and applied it to a toy model. In the present work we use this method for the electromagnetic form factors of the $\rho$-meson. By matching the results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, we provide a first, crude estimate of all three form factors of the $\rho$-meson within the effective field theory. Contact contributions to these form factors turn out to be substantial. A procedure for lattice calculations is outlined, paving the way for an ab initio approach to the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles numerical simulations, we find a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in a rotating gluon plasma. This mixed phase simultaneously contains regions of both confining and deconfining states in thermal equilibrium, separated by a spatial transition. The position of the boundary between the two phases is determined by the local critical temperature. We calculate the critical temperature of the local transition as a function of angular velocity and radius for a full (imaginary) rotating system and within a local thermalization approximation, and find an excellent agreement between these approaches. An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we discuss the finite-size scaling analysis of the order parameter related to the chiral phase transition in QCD with two massless quarks. We use data obtained in lattice QCD calculations performed with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) for a range of light quark masses, $1/240 \leq m_\ell/m_s \leq 1/27$ for different spatial volumes ($N_\sigma$) on Euclidean lattices with temporal extent $N_\tau=8$, satisfying $3\,N_\tau \leq N_\sigma \leq 10\,N_\tau$. We observe that infinite volume extrapolated data for the order parameter agree reasonably well with the expected $O(2)$ scaling behavior even for physical ratios of the light-to-strange quark mass ratio. We quantify deviations from asymptotic scaling and perform a detailed analysis of the influence of finite-size effects in terms of temperature and quark masses at a fixed lattice cutoff. This is crucial for improving the reliability of the infinite-volume extrapolated estimate of the chiral order parameter and for a more precise determination of chiral phase transition temperature from direct Lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>The Axion-Photon Mixing and the Extragalactic Magnetic Background: Plateau Regimes, Resonances, and Non-Gaussian Boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical treatment of Axion-Like-Particle (ALP)--photon mixing with extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation for constant, Gaussian-stochastic, and non-Gaussian magnetic field configurations--with direct implications for Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations such as LHAASO, HAWC, and CTA experiments. For constant fields, we derive exact probabilities and identify a perturbative plateau regime where photon survival scales as quartic order of magnetic field, isolating the four-point magnetic correlation as a sensitive probe of non-Gaussianity. For Gaussian stochastic fields, we obtain--for the first time--analytical formulas for non-exponential-decay components in the strong-attenuation regime. Contrary to the widely used domain-like model, photon survival is suppressed by 4-6 orders of magnitude, while both conversion and survival probabilities exhibit distinct multi-peak structures from mass-equal resonance, stochastic resonance, and EBL attenuation. Extending to non-Gaussian fields, we show that non-Gaussianity can enhance photon survival by several orders of magnitude relative to the Gaussian case, potentially explaining the unexpectedly VHE photon event observed by LHAASO. Our results demonstrate that stochastic magnetic fields cannot be reduced to domain-like coherence without losing essential physics, and that VHE gamma-ray spectra encode observable information about both the power spectrum and non-Gaussian structure of intergalactic magnetic fields--critical as next-generation observatories push toward PeV sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Imprints of primordial magnetic fields on the late-time Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) generated in the early Universe may leave observable imprints in the present-day large-scale structure. However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields.</description>

      <title>The Muon Magnetic Moment and Physics Beyond the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the role of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon a_\mu as a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), taking advantage of the final result of the Fermilab g-2 experiment and the recently updated Standard Model value. This review provides both a comprehensive summary of the current status, as well as an accessible entry point for phenomenologists with interests in dark matter, Higgs and electroweak or neutrino and flavour physics in the context of a wide range of BSM scenarios. It begins with a qualitative overview of the field and a collection of key properties and typical results. It then focuses on model-independent, generic formulas and classifies types of BSM scenarios with or without chiral enhancements. A strong emphasis of the review are the connections to a large number of other observables -- ranging from the muon mass and the muon--Higgs coupling and related dipole observables to dark matter, neutrino masses and high-energy collider observables. Finally, we survey a number of well-motivated BSM scenarios such as dark photons, axion-like particles, the two-Higgs doublet model, supersymmetric models and models with leptoquarks, vector-like leptons or neutrino mass models. We discuss the impact of the updated Standard Model value for a_\mu and of complementary constraints, exploring the phenomenology and identifying excluded and viable parameter regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, motivated by several beyond the Standard Model signal topologies, we perform detailed background mitigation analyses for the DUNE near detector. Specifically, we investigate $e^+ e^-$, $e^- \gamma$, $\gamma$, and $\gamma\gamma$ final states that may arise from long-lived particles, including light mediators, dark matter, heavy neutral leptons, and axion-like particles (ALPs), decaying or scattering inside the liquid argon detector. To this end, we employ both photophilic and leptophilic ALPs as phenomenological benchmarks. The aforementioned final states leave a hard electromagnetic signature with no hadronic activity above the detector energy thresholds. Nevertheless, such signatures are not immune to backgrounds from neutrino scattering in the detector, which are in the focus of our study. In order to model realistic experimental analyses, we take into account particle misidentification rates, cross-contamination effects, and detector responses. We calculate confidence limit projections for DUNE, thereby presenting realistic capabilities for constraining or discovering new physics manifested through electromagnetic showers.</description>

      <title>The vacuum stability and the hierarchy problem in a fermionic dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extension to the Standard Model (SM) with four new fields including scalar($S$), spinor($\psi^{1,2}$) and vector($V_\mu$) under new $U(1)$ gauge group in the hidden sector. The scalar particle interacts with the SM Higgs particle and is an intermediary between the dark and the SM parts . Our dark matter(DM) candidate is the spinor particle. We show that the model successfully explains the relic density of the DM in the universe and evades the strong bounds from direct detection experiments while respecting the theoretical constraints and the vacuum stability conditions. In addition, we study the hierarchy problem within the Veltman approach by solving the renormalization group equations at one-loop. We demonstrate that the addition of the new fields contributes to the Veltman parameters which in turn results in satisfying the Veltman conditions much lower than the Planck scale. For the our DM model we find one representative point in the viable parameter space which satisfy also the Veltman conditions at $\Lambda$ = 1 TeV. Therefore, the presence of the extra particle solves the fine-tuning problem of the Higgs mass.</description>

      <title>Generalised Casas-Ibarra Parametrisation for Majorana Neutrino Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple and broadly applicable extension of the Casas-Ibarra parametrisation that captures the structure of all Majorana neutrino mass models. Building directly on the original formulation, our approach naturally accommodates additional degrees of freedom and provides a unified, minimal framework for parametrising the Yukawa sector. It significantly simplifies both analytical treatments and numerical scans, and can be universally applied to any Majorana neutrino mass model, regardless of the underlying dynamics. The approach also offers a unified framework for classifying neutrino mass models according to the structure of the neutrino mass matrix, which naturally motivates the proposal of an extended version of the Scotogenic Model. This classification scheme yields tree-level (loop-level) representative models: the seesaw (Scotogenic Model), the linear seesaw (the Generalised Scotogenic Model), and the linear plus inverse seesaw (the Extended Scotogenic Model). We provide ready-to-use explicit expressions for several well-known scenarios, including the Zee model where one of the Yukawa matrices is antisymmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of hadronic final states in electron-positron or electron-hadron collisions is induced predominantly by quasi-real photons that were emitted off incoming leptons. In these processes, the photon either enters directly or through its resolved parton content, which is at present only loosely constrained by experimental data. We perform a detailed phenomenological study of photon-induced jet production processes in high-energy $e^+e^-$ collisions, investigating in particular their potential to assess contributions from the resolved photon structure.</description>

      <title>ALP-mediated Dark Matter-Nucleon Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of dark matter-nucleon scattering via the exchange of axion-like particles (ALPs). At first sight, this might appear of little practical use, as non-relativistic scattering through pseudo-scalar interactions is momentum-suppressed and spin-dependent, resulting in scattering rates below any experimental sensitivity. We show that the scattering rate can be drastically enhanced in two ways. First, light ALPs with masses below the typical momentum transfer at direct detection experiments lift the momentum suppression by acting as essentially massless mediators. Second, ALP exchange through loops induces coherent spin-independent scattering. If the ALP has flavor-changing couplings to up-type quarks, loop-induced scattering receives an extra strong enhancement by the top-quark mass. We deduce that, contrary to common lore, XENONnT and PandaX-4T are already sensitive to ALP-mediated dark matter-nucleon scattering. The next generation of direct detection experiments will probe far into the parameter space of the ALP effective theory, potentially exceeding the sensitivity of collider searches.</description>

Abstract: As the hunt for dark matter progresses, recently there have been advances in the search for heavy dark matter with a mass well above a TeV. We show the importance of properly modeling the local dark matter velocity distribution, beyond the standard Maxwellian halo model, and in particular how the dynamics of the Large Magellanic Cloud and Milky Way may impact heavy dark matter searches. We introduce some new computational techniques for accurately computing the dark matter flux and the associated detector response. As a specific example, we examine the effect of the Large Magellanic Cloud on heavy dark matter bounds obtained from experiments searching for cosmic rays and magnetic monopoles using plastic etch detectors at the Ohya Mine and aboard the Skylab Space Station.</description>

Abstract: We present disperon QED, a method to deal with data input in loop processes in Monte Carlo codes. It relies on dispersion relations, automated tools such as OpenLoops, effective field theory methods and a threshold subtraction. We motivate this method and apply it to the process $ee\to\pi\pi$ in McMule to deal with hadronic vacuum polarisation insertions in two-loop contributions as well as the vector form factor of the pion within the form-factor scalar QED approximation. The generality of this method for more complicated processes is emphasised.</description>

      <title>Hiding a Light Vector Boson from Terrestrial Experiments: A Chargephobic Dark Photon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the terrestrial, astrophysical and cosmological constraints on a light vector boson that couples to an arbitrary combination of the electromagnetic and $B-L$ currents of the Standard Model. The dark photon and a vector boson coupling to $B-L$ are special cases of our generalized flavor-universal anomaly-free vector boson, requiring just one additional parameter (the "dark mixing angle" corresponding to the linear combination of the electromagnetic and $B-L$ currents) beyond that of the overall coupling strength and the vector boson mass, where we focus on the range $1\, {\rm MeV}$ to $60\, {\rm GeV}$. We perform a detailed investigation of a unique combination where the vector boson couplings to electrically charged leptons and protons are highly suppressed: the "chargephobic dark photon". A chargephobic vector boson is very weakly constrained by current terrestrial experiments including beam dumps and collider experiments, since they rely on couplings to electrons and protons. Instead, neutrino scattering experiments (such as COHERENT), astrophysical sources (supernova emission), and cosmology ($\Delta N_{\rm eff}$) provide the strongest constraints due to the nonzero couplings of the chargephobic vector boson to neutrinos and neutrons. Indeed, we find that supernova emission and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ provide constraints throughout the space of dark mixing angles, demonstrating their importance to provide model-independent constraints. For nearly all of the parameter space, a chargephobic vector boson is the most weakly constrained anomaly-free vector boson that couples to flavor-independent or flavor-dependent combinations of Standard Model currents. Finally, we highlight the importance of future experiments, including SHiP, that are able to probe new regions of the chargephobic parameter space due to the significantly improved detector capabilities.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Evolution for In-medium Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles analysis of the renormalization group (RG) evolution of the two-point energy-energy correlator (EEC) in light-quark and gluon jets propagating through nuclear matter. Our work focuses on the analytic structure of the RG equations in the thin-medium regime, highlighting how collinear emissions in the presence of a dense QCD medium reshape the EEC observables. We work in the opacity expansion of the SCET$_{\rm G}$ formalism, where the propagating quarks and gluons interact with the medium via Glauber gluon exchanges. We compute the corresponding one-loop jet functions using the medium-induced splitting kernels at first order in opacity and perform resummation at leading logarithmic (LL) order. In particular, we identify an experimentally accessible regime of jet energies and EEC angles where one can directly investigate the medium-induced scale evolution and extract the corresponding opacity-one correction to the anomalous dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically, using the method of regions, the Coulomb-logarithmic enhancement regulated by plasma screening for EEC. We compare our theoretical predictions with experimental data in $p$-Pb collisions and make projections for O-O collisions to test whether energy correlators could serve as sensitive probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) dynamics in small collision systems, offering a robust and model-independent avenue for constraining jet evolution in QCD matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the derivation of an alternative representation of the real-time in-in formalism under a spatially homogeneous and time independent electric field. Because the system exhibits instability associated with pair production of particles and antiparticles, the perturbation theory should be reorganized depending on the choice of the reference vacuum. We recast the boundary wavefunctions into the quadratic self-energy-like terms in the functional integration formalism. The resulting generating functional in the modified in-in formalism leads to the propagators that resum infinite diagrams necessary to capture the vacuum-instability effects. The proper-time representations of the propagators reproduce the known expressions from the canonical operator formalism, but our derivation based on the generating functional along the closed-time path clarifies the origin of the additional proper-time contour and provides a better physical understanding. Finally, as a concrete example of the application, we compute the in-in expectation value of the vector current in a constant electric field, and find that the simple one-loop calculation captures the pair production effect.</description>

Abstract: Parton distribution function (PDF) at small $x$ in a fast-moving proton is investigated within an upgraded parton model that includes parton splitting with branching cascades and parton fusion. In the region of moderately small $x$, we obtain a power-law behavior of the parton density $x f(x)$ with an exponent proportional to the logarithm of the probability of parton splitting. Taking into account parton fusion leads to a nonlinear equation for the PDF. In the region of very small $x$, the phenomenon of saturation of the parton density is detected and a model estimate of its value in this regime is obtained. The results are compared with those obtained previously based on the analysis of equations in logarithmic approximations of perturbative QCD.</description>

Abstract: We study the three-body systems $DNN$ and $D^{*}NN$ within a hadronic molecular framework by combining a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction with a $D^{(*)}N$ potential constrained by heavy-quark symmetry. The three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved with the Gaussian Expansion Method, and the analytic structure of the spectrum is investigated using the Complex Scaling Method. We find that the $DNN$ system supports a robust and compact bound state in the $I(J^{P})=\tfrac{1}{2}(1^-)$ channel over a broad range of cutoff values, even when the corresponding $DN$ subsystem is weakly bound or unbound. For $D^{*}NN$, the spin-$1$ nature of the heavy meson and the associated spin-dependent forces generate a clear spin hierarchy: deeply bound states appear in both $0^-$ and $2^-$ channels, while the $1^-$ channel exhibits a characteristic two-branch pattern with a strongly bound compact branch and a more weakly bound, spatially extended branch. The root-mean-square radii indicate pronounced spatial compression compared with the deuteron scale, highlighting the cooperative roles of realistic $NN$ correlations, the $D^{(*)}N$ interactions, and heavy-quark symmetry in forming compact heavy-flavor few-body bound states. No three-body resonances under complex scaling are found in the explored parameter space. Our results provide quantitative benchmarks for future experimental searches for such charmed-meson-nuclear bound states.</description>

      <title>2025 EIC-France Workshop: Physics Highlights and Perspectives</title>

Abstract: This document presents a synthesis of the theory contributions and discussions from the 2nd EIC-France Workshop, held at IJCLab (Orsay) on 1-3 December 2025. The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.
  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.
  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program.</description>

      <title>Black holes and gravitational waves from phase transitions in realistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study realistic models predicting primordial black hole (PBH) formation from density fluctuations generated in a first-order phase transition. We show that the second-order correction in the expansion of the bubble nucleation rate is necessary for accurate predictions and quantify its impact on the abundance of PBHs and gravitational waves (GWs). We find that the distribution of the fluctuations becomes more Gaussian as the second-order term increases. Consequently, models that predict the same PBH abundances can produce different GW spectra.</description>

      <title>Fundamental quantum limits for detecting ultrahigh frequency gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultrahigh-frequency (above 10 kHz) gravitational waves (GW) window provides a unique opportunity to detect primordial GWs, free from astrophysical foregrounds that dominate lower frequencies. A stochastic GW background in this range is generically predicted from cosmological phase transitions and topological defects associated with grand unification and other ultra-high energy theories. We establish a universal quantum limit framework for various detection schemes, setting a fundamental bound on GW detectability. Our analysis reveals that backgrounds in the kHz-MHz range are in principle observable, whereas higher-frequency signals lie below the quantum limit. These results offer theoretical guidance for future detector designs and open new avenues for probing early universe physics.</description>

      <title>Infra-red enhanced loops in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that logarithmically enhanced infra-red loop corrections arising in theories with four derivatives correspond to a physical running of couplings, rendering quadratic gravity asymptotically free. We find that these effects depend on the gauge and on the field parameterisation. We compute physical on-shell amplitudes and find genuine infra-red log-enhanced loop corrections, that are process-dependent and cannot be absorbed into running couplings. As a byproduct, we derive the effective action of quadratic gravity at tree level, showing that its ghost does not contribute to effective operators and thereby does not violate positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear causality of Israel-Stewart theory with diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully nonlinear causality constraints in $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions for Israel-Stewart theory in the presence of energy and number diffusion in the Eckart and Landau hydrodynamic frames, respectively. These constraints are algebraic inequalities that make no assumption on the underlying geometry of the spacetime or the equation of state. In order to highlight the distinct physical and structural behavior of the two hydrodynamic frames, we discuss the special ultrarelativistic ideal gas equation of state considered in earlier literature in $D = 1 + 1$ dimensions, and show that our general $D = 3 + 1$ constraints reduce to their results upon an appropriate choice of angles. For this equation of state in both $D = 1 + 1$ and $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions one can show that: (i) there exists a region allowed by nonlinear causality in which the baryon current transitions into a spacelike vector in the Landau frame, and (ii) an analogous argument shows that the solutions of the Eckart frame equations of motion never violate the dominant energy condition, assuming nonlinear causality holds. We then compare our results with those from linearized Israel-Stewart theory and show that the linear causality bounds fail to capture the new physical constraints on energy and number diffusion that are successfully obtained through our nonlinear causality approach.</description>

      <title>Overview of the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project for Astronomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for dark matter has been ongoing for decades within both astrophysics and particle physics. Both fields have employed different approaches and conceived a variety of methods for constraining the properties of dark matter, but have done so in relative isolation of one another. From an astronomer's perspective, it can be challenging to interpret the results of dark matter particle physics experiments and how these results apply to astrophysical scales. Over the past few years, the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project has been developing tools to aid the particle physics community in constraining dark matter properties; however, ESCAPE itself also aims to foster collaborations between research disciplines. This is especially important in the search for dark matter, as while particle physics is concerned with detecting the particles themselves, all of the evidence for its existence lies solely within astrophysics and cosmology. Here, we present a short review of the progress made by the Dark Matter Test Science Project and their applications to existing experiments, with a view towards how this project can foster complementary with astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Locality constraints in AdS$_2$ without parity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bulk locality constraints in quantum field theories in AdS$_2$. The known derivation of locality sum rules in AdS$_{d+1}$ does not apply for $d=1$ due to the different singularity structure of the conformal blocks and the inequivalence of operator orderings on the boundary. Assuming unitarity and a mild growth condition, we establish power-law bounds for correlators, derive dispersion relations and an expansion in terms of ``even'' and ``odd'' local blocks that converges in the entire AdS$_2$. These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric coefficients of two-flavor quark matter from the Kubo formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hot quark matter created in heavy-ion collision experiments can exhibit strong temperature and chemical-potential gradients, which in turn can generate electric fields through thermoelectric effects. In this work, we investigate two relevant thermoelectric coefficients -- the thermopower (Seebeck coefficient) and the Thomson coefficient -- of two-flavor quark matter using the Kubo formalism and the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model as an effective description of dense, finite-temperature QCD. The required two-point equilibrium correlation functions are evaluated using the Matsubara formalism of thermal field theory, applying a 1/Nc expansion to the relevant multi-loop Feynman diagrams. We employ previously derived quark spectral functions obtained from one--meson-exchange diagrams above the Mott transition temperature. Our numerical results show that both thermoelectric coefficients increase approximately linearly with temperature and decrease with increasing chemical potential. We also estimate the magnitude of the electric fields that can be generated in heavy-ion collisions by thermal gradients via the Seebeck effect.</description>

      <title>On the Weyl anomaly for chiral fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the parity-odd part of the Weyl anomaly for chiral fermions in a background gravitational field. We start from a manifestly real form of the Lagrangian (that is, not only real up to a total derivative), and we regularize it by means of Pauli-Villars fermions. All parity-odd terms in the anomaly cancel in the integrand, so that the result of the anomaly is necessarily parity-even.</description>

      <title>Symmetric teleparallel gravitational effects on solar neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations probe the quantum gravity interface in unique ways. While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.</description>
