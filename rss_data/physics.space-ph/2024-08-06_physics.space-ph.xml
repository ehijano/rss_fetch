      <title>Electrostatic Waves and Electron Holes in Simulations of Low-Mach Quasi-Perpendicular Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless low Mach number shocks are abundant in astrophysical and space plasma environments, exhibiting complex wave activity and wave-particle interactions. In this paper, we present 2D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of quasi-perpendicular nonrelativistic ($\vsh \approx (5500-22000)$ km/s) low Mach number shocks, with a specific focus on studying electrostatic waves in the shock ramp and the precursor regions. In these shocks, an ion-scale oblique whistler wave creates a configuration with two hot counter-streaming electron beams, which drive unstable electron acoustic waves (EAWs) that can turn into electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) at the late stage of their evolution. By conducting simulations with periodic boundaries, we show that EAW properties agree with linear dispersion analysis. The characteristics of ESWs in shock simulations, including their wavelength and amplitude, depend on the shock velocity. When extrapolated to shocks with realistic velocities ($\vsh \approx 300$ km/s), the ESW wavelength is reduced to one tenth of the electron skin depth and the ESW amplitude is anticipated to surpass that of the quasi-static electric field by more than a factor of 100. These theoretical predictions may explain a discrepancy, between PIC and satellite measurements, in the relative amplitude of high- and low-frequency electric field fluctuations.</description>

      <title>MHD waves in homogeneous and continuously stratified atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic equations, concepts, and modes of linear, ideal, MHD waves -- slow, Alfv\'en and fast -- are set out and generalised to gravitationally-stratified atmospheres. Particular attention is devoted to mode conversion, wherein the local behavior of a global wave changes from one mode to another in passing through particular atmospheric layers. Exact solutions are explored where available. Eikonal methods -- WKBJ and ray theory -- are described. Although our emphasis is on the theoretical underpinning of the subject, the solar atmospheric heating implications of fast/slow and fast/Alfv\'en conversions are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>SLAMS-Propelled Electron Acceleration at High-Mach Number Astrophysical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short Large Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) are frequently detected during spacecraft crossings over the Earth bow shock. We investigate the existence of such structures at astrophysical shocks, where they could result from the steepening of cosmic-ray (CR) driven waves. Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we study the growth of SLAMS and the appearance of associated transient shocks in the upstream region of quasi-parallel, non-relativistic, high-Mach number collisionless shocks. We find that high-energy CRs significantly enhance the transverse magnetic field within SLAMS, producing highly inclined field lines. As SLAMS are advected towards the shock, these fields lines form an intermittent superluminal configuration which traps magnetized electrons at fast shocks. Due to their oscillatory nature, SLAMS are periodically separated by subluminal gaps with lower transverse magnetic field strength. In these regions, electrons diffuse and accelerate by bouncing between the shock and the approaching SLAMS region through a mechanism that we call quasi-periodic shock acceleration (QSA). We analytically derive the distribution of electrons accelerated via QSA, $f(p)\sim p^{[-4.7,-5.7]}$, which agrees well with the simulation spectra. We find that the electron power law remains steep until the end of our longest runs, providing a possible explanation for the steep electron spectra observed at least up to GeV energies in young and fast supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>SEP environment in the inner heliosphere from Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun drives a supersonic wind which inflates a giant plasma bubble in our very local interstellar neighborhood, the heliosphere. It is bathed in an extremely variable background of energetic ions and electrons which originate from a number of sources. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated in the vicinity of the Sun, whereas shocks driven by solar disturbances are observed to accelerate energetic storm particles (ESPs). Moreover, a dilute population with a distinct composition forms the anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) which are of a mixed interstellar-heliospheric origin. Particles are also accelerated at planetary bow shocks. We will present recent observations of energetic particles by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, as well as other spacecraft that allow us to study the acceleration and transport of energetic particles at multiple locations in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Plasma Composition of 67P/C-G at different Heliocentric Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rosetta spacecraft accompanied the comet 67P/C-G for nearly 2 years, collecting valuable data on the neutral and ion composition of the coma. The Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) provided continuous measurements of the in situ plasma density while ROSINA-COPS monitored the neutral composition. In this work, we aim to estimate the composition of the cometary ionosphere at different heliocentric distances of the comet. Lauter et al. (2020) derived the temporal evolution of the volatile sublimation rates for 50 separated time intervals on the orbit of 67P/C-G using the COPS and DFMS data. We use these sublimation rates as inputs in a multifluid chemical-hydrodynamical model for 36 of the time intervals for heliocentric distances &lt; 3 au. We compare the total ion densities obtained from our models with the local plasma density measured by the RPC instruments. We find that at the location of the spacecraft, our modeled ion densities match with the in situ measured plasma density within factors of 1 - 3 for many of the time intervals. We obtain the cometocentric distance variation of the ions H2O+ and H3O+ and the ion groups created respectively by the ionization and protonation of neutral species. We see that H3O+ is dominant at the spacecraft location for nearly all the time intervals while ions created due to protonation are dominant at low cometocentric distances for the intervals near perihelion. We also discuss our ion densities in the context of their detection by DFMS.</description>

      <title>Evidence of dual energy transfer driven by magnetic reconnection at sub-ion scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of energy transfer in the kinetic range of plasma turbulence have fundamental implications on the turbulent heating of space and astrophysical plasmas. It was recently suggested that magnetic reconnection may be responsible for driving the sub-ion scale cascade, and that this process would be characterized by a direct energy transfer towards even smaller scales (until dissipation), and a simultaneous inverse transfer of energy towards larger scales, until the ion break. Here we employ the space-filter technique on high-resolution 2D3V hybrid-Vlasov simulations of continuously driven turbulence providing for the first time quantitative evidence that magnetic reconnection is indeed able to trigger a dual energy transfer originating at sub-ion scales.</description>

      <title>Hard X-rays from the deep solar atmosphere. An unusual UV burst with flare properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explosive transient events occur throughout the solar atmosphere. The differing manifestations range from coronal mass ejections to Ellerman bombs. The former may have negligible signatures in the lower atmosphere, and the latter may have negligible nonthermal emissions such as hard X-radiation. A solar flare generally involves a broad range of emission signatures. Using a suite of four space-borne telescopes, we report a solar event that combines aspects of simple UV bursts and hard X-ray emitting flares at the same time. The event is a compact C-class flare in active region AR11861, SOL2013-10-12T00:30. By fitting a combined isothermal and nonthermal model to the hard X-ray spectrum, we inferred plasma temperatures in excess of 15\,MK and a nonthermal power of about $3\times10^{27}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ in this event. Despite these high temperatures and evidence for nonthermal particles, the flare was mostly confined to the chromosphere. However, the event lacked clear signatures of UV spectral lines, such as the Fe\,{\sc xii} 1349\,\AA\ and Fe\,{\sc xxi} 1354\,\AA\ emission lines, which are characteristic of emission from hotter plasma with a temperature over 1\,MK. Moreover, the event exhibited very limited signatures in the extreme-UV wavelengths. Our study indicates that a UV burst -- hard X-ray flare hybrid phenomenon exists in the low solar atmosphere. Plasma that heats to high temperatures coupled with particle acceleration by magnetic energy that is released directly in the lower atmosphere sheds light on the nature of active region core heating and on inferences of flare signatures.</description>
