      <title>An Efficient Digital Watermarking Technique for Small Scale devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of IoT and mobile platforms, ensuring that content stay authentic whilst avoiding overburdening limited hardware is a key problem. This study introduces hybrid Fast Wavelet Transform &amp; Additive Quantization index Modulation (FWT-AQIM) scheme, a lightweight watermarking approach that secures digital pictures on low-power, memory-constrained small scale devices to achieve a balanced trade-off among robustness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency. The method embeds watermark in the luminance component of YCbCr color space using low-frequency FWT sub-bands, minimizing perceptual distortion, using additive QIM for simplicity. Both the extraction and embedding processes run in less than 40 ms and require minimum RAM when tested on a Raspberry Pi 5. Quality assessments on standard and high-resolution images yield PSNR greater than equal to 34 dB and SSIM greater than equal to 0.97, while robustness verification includes various geometric and signal-processing attacks demonstrating near-zero bit error rates and NCC greater than equal to 0.998. Using a mosaic-based watermark, redundancy added enhancing robustness without reducing throughput, which peaks at 11 MP/s. These findings show that FWT-AQIM provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-time, secure watermarking in bandwidth- and power-constrained contexts, opening the way for dependable content protection in developing IoT and multimedia applications.</description>

      <title>The State-of-the-Art in Lifelog Retrieval: A Review of Progress at the ACM Lifelog Search Challenge Workshop 2022-24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ACM Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC) is a venue that welcomes and compares systems that support the exploration of lifelog data, and in particular the retrieval of specific information, through an interactive competition format. This paper reviews the recent advances in interactive lifelog retrieval as demonstrated at the ACM LSC from 2022 to 2024. Through a detailed comparative analysis, we highlight key improvements across three main retrieval tasks: known-item search, question answering, and ad-hoc search. Our analysis identifies trends such as the widespread adoption of embedding-based retrieval methods (e.g., CLIP, BLIP), increased integration of large language models (LLMs) for conversational retrieval, and continued innovation in multimodal and collaborative search interfaces. We further discuss how specific retrieval techniques and user interface (UI) designs have impacted system performance, emphasizing the importance of balancing retrieval complexity with usability. Our findings indicate that embedding-driven approaches combined with LLMs show promise for lifelog retrieval systems. Likewise, improving UI design can enhance usability and efficiency. Additionally, we recommend reconsidering multi-instance system evaluations within the expert track to better manage variability in user familiarity and configuration effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of Static Image Sub-Region-Based Search Models Using CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous, specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation box.</description>

      <title>Harmony-Aware Music-driven Motion Synthesis with Perceptual Constraint on UGC Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the popularity of video-based user-generated content (UGC) on social media, harmony, as dictated by human perceptual principles, is critical in assessing the rhythmic consistency of audio-visual UGCs for better user engagement. In this work, we propose a novel harmony-aware GAN framework, following a specifically designed harmony evaluation strategy to enhance rhythmic synchronization in the automatic music-to-motion synthesis using a UGC dance dataset. This harmony strategy utilizes refined cross-modal beat detection to capture closely correlated audio and visual rhythms in an audio-visual pair. To mimic human attention mechanism, we introduce saliency-based beat weighting and interval-driven beat alignment, which ensures accurate harmony score estimation consistent with human perception. Building on this strategy, our model, employing efficient encoder-decoder and depth-lifting designs, is adversarially trained based on categorized musical meter segments to generate realistic and rhythmic 3D human motions. We further incorporate our harmony evaluation strategy as a weakly supervised perceptual constraint to flexibly guide the synchronized audio-visual rhythms during the generation process. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms other leading music-to-motion methods in rhythmic harmony, both quantitatively and qualitatively, even with limited UGC training data.

      <title>TimeWak: Temporal Chained-Hashing Watermark for Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5 datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.</description>

      <title>From Swath to Full-Disc: Advancing Precipitation Retrieval with Multimodal Knowledge Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance, outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.</description>

      <title>Learning Compact Vision Tokens for Efficient Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile, weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The source code and trained weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/LLaVA-STF.</description>

      <title>SongBloom: Coherent Song Generation via Interleaved Autoregressive Sketching and Diffusion Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating music with coherent structure, harmonious instrumental and vocal elements remains a significant challenge in song generation. Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms. Audio samples are available on our demo page: https://cypress-yang.github.io/SongBloom\_demo.</description>

      <title>VIVAT: Virtuous Improving VAE Training through Artifact Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.</description>

      <title>Token Communications: A Unified Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>HAIC: Improving Human Action Understanding and Generation with Better Captions for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made great progress in video understanding. However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 412 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 2,000 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.</description>

      <title>AdaReTaKe: Adaptive Redundancy Reduction to Perceive Longer for Video-language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized video understanding, yet are still limited by context length when processing long videos. Recent methods compress videos by leveraging visual redundancy uniformly, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, our quantitative analysis shows that redundancy varies significantly across time and model layers, necessitating a more flexible compression strategy. We propose AdaReTaKe, a training-free method that flexibly reduces visual redundancy by allocating compression ratios among time and layers with theoretical guarantees. Integrated into state-of-the-art MLLMs, AdaReTaKe improves processing capacity from 256 to 2048 frames while preserving critical information. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench datasets demonstrate that AdaReTaKe outperforms existing methods by 2.3% and 2.8% for 7B and 72B models, respectively, with even greater improvements of 5.9% and 6.0% on the longest LVBench. Our code is available at https://github.com/SCZwangxiao/video-FlexReduc.git.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Tversky-Aware Domain Incremental Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for multimodal MRI segmentation with missing modalities typically assume that all MRI modalities are available during training. However, in clinical practice, some modalities may be missing due to the sequential nature of MRI acquisition, leading to performance degradation. Furthermore, retraining models to accommodate newly available modalities can be inefficient and may cause overfitting, potentially compromising previously learned knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Replay-based Hypergraph Domain Incremental Learning (ReHyDIL) for brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. ReHyDIL leverages Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) to enable the segmentation model to learn from newly acquired MRI modalities without forgetting previously learned information. To enhance segmentation performance across diverse patient scenarios, we introduce the Cross-Patient Hypergraph Segmentation Network (CHSNet), which utilizes hypergraphs to capture high-order associations between patients. Additionally, we incorporate Tversky-Aware Contrastive (TAC) loss to effectively mitigate information imbalance both across and within different modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2019 dataset demonstrate that ReHyDIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of over 2% in the Dice Similarity Coefficient across various tumor regions. Our code is available at https://github.com/reeive/ReHyDIL.</description>

      <title>TUNA: Comprehensive Fine-grained Temporal Understanding Evaluation on Dense Dynamic Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Videos are unique in their integration of temporal elements, including camera, scene, action, and attribute, along with their dynamic relationships over time. However, existing benchmarks for video understanding often treat these properties separately or narrowly focus on specific aspects, overlooking the holistic nature of video content. To address this, we introduce TUNA, a temporal-oriented benchmark for fine-grained understanding on dense dynamic videos, with two complementary tasks: captioning and QA. Our TUNA features diverse video scenarios and dynamics, assisted by interpretable and robust evaluation criteria. We evaluate several leading models on our benchmark, providing fine-grained performance assessments across various dimensions. This evaluation reveals key challenges in video temporal understanding, such as limited action description, inadequate multi-subject understanding, and insensitivity to camera motion, offering valuable insights for improving video understanding models. The data and code are available at https://friedrichor.github.io/projects/TUNA.</description>
