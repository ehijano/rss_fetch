      <title>Solar Sources of Flares and CMEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are prone to originate within and near active regions (ARs) with a high magnetic complexity. Therefore, to better understand the generation mechanism of flares and the resultant CME eruption and to gain insight into their stellar counterparts, it is crucial to reveal how solar flare-productive ARs are generated and developed. In this review, first, we summarize some general aspects of solar flares and key observational characteristics of such ARs. Then, we discuss a series of flux emergence simulations that were performed to elucidate the subsurface origins of their complexity and introduce state-of-the-art models that consider the effect of turbulent thermal convection. Future flare observations using SOLAR-C, a next-generation high-throughput extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy mission, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>He-accreting oxygen-neon white dwarfs and accretion-induced collapse events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been widely accepted that mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae or electron-capture supernovae. Previous work has shown that the accretion rate could affect the elemental abundance on the outer layers of CO WDs, and therefore affect the observational characteristics after they exploded as SNe Ia. However, it has not been well studied how elemental abundance changes on the outer layers of He-accreting ONe WDs as they approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In this paper, we investigated the evolution of He-accreting ONe WDs with MESA. We found that a CO-rich mantle will accumulate beneath the He layers resulting from the He burning, after which the ignition of the CO-rich mantle could transform carbon into silicon (Si). The amount of Si produced by carbon burning is strongly anti-correlated with the accretion rate. As the ONe WD nearly approaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit (Mch) through accretion, it is likely to undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC), resulting in the formation of the neutron star (NS).</description>

      <title>S-Process Nucleosynthesis in Chemically Peculiar Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around half of the heavy elements in the universe are formed through the slow neutron capture (s-) process, which takes place in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses $1-6\;M_{\odot}$. The nucleosynthetic imprint of the s-process can be studied by observing the material on the surface of binary barium, carbon, CH, and CEMP stars. We study the s-process by observing the luminous components of binary systems polluted by a previous AGB companion. Our radial velocity (RV) monitoring program establishes a collection of binary stars exhibiting enrichment in s-process material for the study of elemental abundances, production of s-process material, and binary mass transfer. From high resolution optical spectra, we measure RVs for 350 stars and derive stellar parameters for 150 stars using ATHOS. For a sub-sample of 24 stars we refine our atmospheric parameters using the Xiru program. We use the MOOG code to compute 1D-LTE abundances of C, Mg, s-process elements Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pb, and Eu to investigate neutron capture events and stellar chemical composition. We estimate dynamical masses by optimising orbits with MCMC techniques in the ELC program, and we compare our results with low-mass AGB models in the FRUITY database. We find enhancements in s-process material in spectroscopic binaries, a signature of AGB mass transfer. We add Mo to the abundance patterns, and for 12 stars we add Pb detections or upper limits. Computed abundances are in general agreement with the literature. Comparing our abundances to the FRUITY yields, we find correlations in s-process enrichment and AGB mass, and agreements in theoretical and dynamically modelled masses. From our high-resolution observations we expand heavy element abundance patterns and highlight binarity in our chemically interesting systems. We investigate evolutionary stages for a small sub-set of our stars.</description>

      <title>On the collisional sensitivity of polarized Mg II solar lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral and singly ionized states of the Magnesium (Mg) are the origin of several spectral lines that are useful for solar diagnostic purposes. An important element in modeling such solar lines is collisional data of the Mg with different perturbers abundant in the Sun, specially with neutral hydrogen. This work aims at providing complete depolarization and polarization and population transfer data for Mg II due to collisions with hydrogen atoms. For this purpose, a general formalism is employed to calculate the needed rates of MgII due to collisions with hydrogen atoms. The resulting collisional rates are then employed to investigate the impact of collisions on the polarization of 25 Mg II lines relevant to solar applications by solving the governing statistical equilibrium equations within multi-level and multi-term atomic models. We find that the polarization of some Mg II lines starts to be sensitive to collisions for hydrogen density $n_H \!\gtrsim\!$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Forming planetary systems that contain only minor planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimates of the frequency of planetary systems in the Milky Way are observationally limited by the low-mass planet regime. Nevertheless, substantial evidence for systems with undetectably low planetary masses now exist in the form of main-sequence stars which host debris discs, as well as metal-polluted white dwarfs. Further, low-mass sections of star formation regions impose upper bounds on protoplanetary disc masses, limiting the capacity for terrestrial or larger planets to form. Here, we use planetary population synthesis calculations to investigate the conditions that allow planetary systems to form only minor planets and smaller detritus. We simulate the accretional, collisional and migratory growth of $10^{17}$ kg embryonic seeds and then quantify which configurations with *entirely* sub-Earth-mass bodies ($\lesssim 10^{24}$ kg) survive. We find that substantial regions of the initial parameter space allow for sub-terrestrial configurations to form, with the success rate most closely tied to the initial dust mass. Total dust mass budgets of up to $10^2 M_{\oplus}$ within 10 au can be insufficiently high to form terrestrial or giant planets, resulting in systems with only minor planets. Consequently, the prevalence of planetary systems throughout the Milky Way might be higher than what is typically assumed, and minor planet-only systems may help inform the currently uncertain correspondence between planet-hosting white dwarfs and metal-polluted white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>A PyTorch Benchmark for High-Contrast Imaging Post Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task that involves distinguishing faint planetary signals from the overpowering glare of their host stars, often obscured by time-varying stellar noise known as "speckles". The predominant algorithms for speckle noise subtraction employ principal-based point spread function (PSF) fitting techniques to discern planetary signals from stellar speckle noise. We introduce torchKLIP, a benchmark package developed within the machine learning (ML) framework PyTorch. This work enables ML techniques to utilize extensive PSF libraries to enhance direct imaging post-processing. Such advancements promise to improve the post-processing of high-contrast images from leading-edge astronomical instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope and extreme adaptive optics systems.</description>

      <title>Q-band Line Survey Observations toward a Carbon-chain-rich Clump in the Serpens South Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted Q-band (30 GHz $-$ 50 GHz) line survey observations toward a carbon-chain emission peak in the Serpens South cluster-forming region with the extended Q-band (eQ) receiver installed on the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. Approximately 180 lines have been detected including tentative detection, and these lines are attributed to 52 molecules including isotopologues. It has been found that this position is rich in carbon-chain species as much as Cyanopolyyne Peak in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1 CP), suggesting chemical youth. Not only carbon-chain species, but several complex organic molecules (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, HCCCHO, CH$_3$CN, and tentatively C$_2$H$_3$CN) have also been detected, which is similar to the chemical complexity found in evolved prestellar cores. The HDCS/H$_2$CS ratio has been derived to be $11.3 \pm 0.5$ %, and this value is similar to the prestellar core L1544. The chemically young features that are similar to the less-dense starless core TMC-1 CP ($10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ $-$ $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) and chemically evolved characters which resemble the dense prestellar core L1544 ($\sim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) mean that the clump including the observed position is a pre-cluster clump without any current star formation activity.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey III: Confirmation of 13CO in YSES 1 b and Atmospheric Detection of YSES 1 c with CRIRES+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopic characterization of young super-Jovian planets enables precise constraints on elemental and isotopic abundances of their atmospheres. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we present high-resolution spectral observations of two wide-orbit super-Jupiters in YSES 1 (or TYC 8998-760-1) using the upgraded VLT/CRIRES+ (R~100,000) in K-band. We carry out free atmospheric retrieval analyses to constrain chemical and isotopic abundances, temperature structures, rotation velocities, and radial velocities. We confirm the previous detection of 13CO in YSES 1 b at a higher significance of 12.6{\sigma}, but point to a higher 12CO/13CO ratio of 88+/-13 (1{\sigma} confidence interval), consistent with the primary's isotope ratio 66+/-5. We retrieve a solar-like composition in YSES 1 b with a C/O=0.57+/-0.01, indicating a formation via gravitational instability or core accretion beyond the CO iceline. Additionally, the observations lead to detections of H2O and CO in the outer planet YSES 1 c at 7.3{\sigma} and 5.7{\sigma}, respectively. We constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio of YSES 1 c to be either solar or subsolar (C/O=0.36+/-0.15), indicating the accretion of oxygen-rich solids. The two companions have distinct vsini, 5.34+/-0.14 km/s for YSES 1 b and 11.3+/-2.1 km/s for YSES 1 c, despite their similar natal environments. This may indicate different spin axis inclinations or effective magnetic braking by the long-lived circumplanetary disk around YSES 1 b. YSES 1 represents an intriguing system for comparative studies of super-Jovian companions and linking present atmospheres to formation histories.</description>

      <title>The fast rise of the unusual Type IIL/IIb SN 2018ivc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic dataset of the Type II supernova (SN) 2018ivc in the nearby (10 Mpc) galaxy Messier 77. Thanks to the high cadence of the CHASE survey, we observed the SN rising very rapidly by nearly three magnitudes in five hours (or 18 mag d$^{-1}$). The $r$-band light curve presents four distinct phases: the maximum light is reached in just one day, then a first, rapid linear decline precedes a short-duration plateau. Finally, a long, slower linear decline lasted for one year. Following a radio rebrightening, we detected SN 2018ivc four years after the explosion. The early spectra show a blue, nearly featureless continuum, but the spectra evolve rapidly: after about 10 days a prominent H$\alpha$ line starts to emerge, with a peculiar profile, but the spectra are heavily contaminated by emission lines from the host galaxy. He I lines, namely $\lambda\lambda$5876,7065, are also strong. On top of the former, a strong absorption from the Na I doublet is visible, indicative of a non-negligible internal reddening. From its equivalent width, we derive a lower limit on the host reddening of $A_V\simeq1.5$ mag, while from the Balmer decrement and a match of the $B-V$ colour curve of SN 2018ivc to that of the comparison objects, a host reddening of $A_V\simeq3.0$ mag is obtained. The spectra are similar to those of SNe II, but with strong He lines. Given the peculiar light curve and spectral features, we suggest SN 2018ivc could be a transitional object between the Type IIL and Type IIb SNe classes. In addition, we found signs of interaction with circumstellar medium in the light curve, making SN 2018ivc also an interacting event. Finally, we modelled the early multi-band light curves and photospheric velocity of SN 2018ivc to estimate the explosion and CSM physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. I. Introducing the GaiaPMEX tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia mission is expected to yield the detection of several thousands of exoplanets, perhaps at least doubling the number of known exoplanets. Although the harvest is expected to occur when the astrometric time series will be published with DR4 at the eve of 2026, the DR3 is already a precious database to search for exoplanet beyond 1 au. With this objective, we characterized multiple systems by exploiting two astrometric signatures derived from the DR3 astrometric solution of bright sources (G&lt;16). We have the proper motion anomaly, or PMa, for sources also observed with Hipparcos, and the excess of residuals in the RUWE and the astrometric excess noise (AEN). Those astrometric signatures give an accurate measurement of the astrometric motion of a source seen with Gaia, even in the presence of calibration and measurement noises. We found that they can allow identifying stellar binaries and hint to companions with a mass in the planetary domain. We introduce a tool called GaiaPMEX, that is able, for a given source, to model its astrometric signatures, by a photocenter orbit due to a companion with certain mass and semi-major axis (sma). Comparing to their actual measurements from the DR3 and Hipparcos, GaiaPMEX calculates a confidence map of the possible companion's mass and sma. The constraints on mass are, as expected, degenerate, but when allowed, coupling the use of PMa and RUWE, may significantly narrow the space of solutions. Thanks to combining Gaia and Hipparcos, planets are expected to be most frequently found within 1-10 au from their star, at the scale of Earth-to-Saturn orbits. In this range, exoplanets with mass down to 0.1 MJup are more favorably detected around M-dwarfs closer than 10 pc. Some fraction, if not all, of companions identified with GaiaPMEX may be characterized in the future using the astrometric time series that will be published with the DR4.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. II. A catalog of 9,698 planet candidate solar-type hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced a new tool called GaiaPMEX. It characterizes the mass and semi-major axis relative to the central star (sma) of a possible companion around any source observed with Gaia. It uses the value of RUWE, or, with both Gaia and Hipparcos, the value of proper motion anomaly (PMa), alone or combined with the RUWE. Our goal is to exploit the large volume of sources in Gaia's DR3 and find new exoplanet candidates. We wish to create a new input catalog of planet-candidate hosting systems to the disposal of future follow-up projects. Beyond G=14, this catalog would prepare the arrival of powerful instruments on the ELTs, that could include RV follow-up of faint stars and direct imaging of planets around main sequence Gyr-old stars. We used the mass-sma degenerate set of solutions obtained by GaiaPMEX from any value of RUWE to select a sample of bright (G&lt;16) Gaia sources whose companions could be planetary, with a mass &lt;13.5 MJup. It led us to identify a sample of 9,698 planet candidate hosting sources, whose companion may have a mass &lt;13.5 MJup in the range of 1-3-au sma. We identified 19 systems that are also reported in the Nasa exoplanet archive. We detected 8 substellar companions with a 1-3-au sma, initially discovered and characterised with RV and astrometry. Moreover, we found 6 transiting-planet systems and 2 wide-orbit systems for whom we predict the existence of supplementary companions. Focusing on the subsample of sources observed with Hipparcos, combining RUWE and PMa, we confirmed the identification of 4 new planetary candidate systems HD 187129, HD 81697, CD-42 883, and HD 105330. Given the degeneracy of mass-sma, many of the candidates in this 9,698 sources catalog might have a larger mass, in the brown-dwarf and stellar domain, if their sma departs from the 1-3-au range. The vetting of this large catalog will be the subject of future studies.</description>

Abstract: We conducted a benchmarking analysis of the semi-regular pulsator and red supergiant $\alpha$ Ori. In its dimming episode last 2020, our observational results include the binned measurements from the space-based telescope SMEI collated. We report a long secondary period of $P_{\text{LSP}}$ = 2350 $\pm$ 10 d and a fundamental pulse of $P_0$ = 415 d $\pm$ 30 d for the interest. Meanwhile, we also detected the first overtone component of $P_1$ = 185 d which supports the current literature's standing for this newly acquired pulse. At $~$2.20 $\pm$ 0.10 $\mu$m, we acquired Near-Infrared $K$-band photometric measurements from several catalogues and surveys in accordance of the calibration. Our assigned inherent color plays at the middle of the extremes from the existing literature. Likewise, we attained a weighted excess color index of $E_{(B-V)}$ = 0.340 and using a $K$-extinction factor of $R_K$ = 0.382 yields an extinction of $A_K$ = 0.130. By subtracting extinction to all $K$-band photometry, using the linearity, and newly derived distance from previous literatures, our effort results to a $\log(L/L_\odot) = 5.00 \pm 0.15_{(-0.45)}^{(+0.48)}$ for $\alpha$ Ori. In turn, this allowed us to conduct the benchmarking scheme alongside the data from existing reports that are stitched together using Period-Luminosity Relationship. This results to a best-fit of $\log(L/L_\odot) = 7.26 \pm 0.10 \times \log P + (-14.10 \pm 0.25)$ and reveals that $\alpha$ Ori can be situated in the lower bound 18 $M_\odot$ regime caused by current pulsation trends.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Legacy survey of Class 0/I disks in Corona australis, Aquila, chaMaeleon, oPhiuchus north, Ophiuchus, Serpens (CAMPOS). I. Evolution of Protostellar disk radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We surveyed nearly all the embedded protostars in seven nearby clouds (Corona Australis, Aquila, Chamaeleon I &amp; II, Ophiuchus North, Ophiuchus, Serpens) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.3mm observations with a resolution of 0.1$"$. This survey detected 184 protostellar disks, 90 of which were observed at a resolution of 14-18 au, making it one of the most comprehensive high-resolution disk samples across various protostellar evolutionary stages to date. Our key findings include the detection of new annular substructures in two Class I and two flat-spectrum sources, while 21 embedded protostars exhibit distinct asymmetries or substructures in their disks. We find that protostellar disks have a substantially large variability in their radii across all evolutionary classes. In particular, the fraction of large disks with sizes above 60\,au decreases as the protostar evolves from Class 0 to Class I. Compiling the literature data, we discovered an increasing trend of the gas disk radii to dust disk radii ratio ($R_{\rm gas,Kep}/R_{\rm mm}$) with increasing bolometric temperature (${\rm T}_{\rm bol}$). Our results indicate that the dust and gas disk radii decouple during the early Class I stage. However, in the Class 0 stage, the dust and gas disk sizes are similar, which allows a direct comparison between models and observational data at the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. We show that the distribution of radii in the 52 Class 0 disks in our sample is in high tension with various disk formation models, indicating that protostellar disk formation remains an unsolved question.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Tests of White Dwarf Cooling Physics with Wide Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present follow-up spectroscopy and a detailed model atmosphere analysis of 29 wide double white dwarfs, including eight systems with a crystallized C/O core member. We use state-of-the-art evolutionary models to constrain the physical parameters of each star, including the total age. Assuming that the members of wide binaries are coeval, any age difference between the binary members can be used to test the cooling physics for white dwarf stars, including potential delays due to crystallization and $^{22}$Ne distillation. We use our control sample of 14 wide binaries with non-crystallized members to show that this method works well; the control sample shows an age difference of only $\Delta$Age = $-0.03 \pm$ 0.15 Gyr between its members. For the eight crystallized C/O core systems we find a cooling anomaly of $\Delta$Age= 1.13$^{+1.20}_{-1.07}$ Gyr. Even though our results are consistent with a small additional cooling delay ($\sim1$ Gyr) from $^{22}$Ne distillation and other neutron-rich impurities, the large uncertainties make this result not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we rule out cooling delays longer than 3.6 Gyr at the 99.7% ($3\sigma$) confidence level for 0.6-0.9 $M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs. Further progress requires larger samples of wide binaries with crystallized massive white dwarf members. We provide a list of subgiant + white dwarf binaries that could be used for this purpose in the future.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 118 New Ultracool Dwarf Candidates Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 118 new ultracool dwarf candidates, discovered using a new machine learning tool, named \texttt{SMDET}, applied to time series images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We gathered photometric and astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and tangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class distribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T subdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young ultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any estimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were collected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5) and T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning tools as a new large-scale discovery technique.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic normalization coefficients for $\alpha+ {}^{12}{\rm C}$ synthesis and the $S$-factor for ${}^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha, \,\gamma){}^{16}{\rm O}$ radiative capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction, determining the survival of carbon in red giants, is of interest for nuclear reaction theory and nuclear astrophysics. A specific feature of the $^{16}$O nuclear structure is the presence of two subthreshold bound states, (6.92 MeV, 2$^+$) and (7.12 MeV, 1$^-$), that dominate the behavior of the low-energy $S$-factor. The strength of these subthreshold states is determined by their asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs), which need to be known with high accuracy. Recently, using a model-independent extrapolation method, Blokhintsev {\it et al.} [Eur. Phys. J. A {\bf 59} (2023) 162] determined the ANCs for the $\alpha$-particle removal taking into account three subthreshold states in $^{16}$O. The goal of this paper is to address four main problems elucidating the impact of the subthreshold ANCs on the low-energy $S$-factor. Firstly, we analyse the connection between variations of the subthreshold ANCs and the low-energy $S$-factor, in particular, at the most effective energy of $300$ keV. Secondly, we calculate contributions to the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor from the subthreshold $1^{-}$ and $2^{+}$ resonances, that are controlled by the subthreshold ANCs. We also evaluate the contribution of the uncertainties of the subthreshold ANCs to the budget of the low-energy $S$-factor uncertainty, especially, the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor. Thirdly, we analyse interference of the subthreshold resonances (SRs) with higher resonances and with the $E1$ and $E2$ direct captures to the ground state. Finally, we investigate a correlated effect of the subthreshold and ground-state ANCs on the low-energy $S$-factor and, in particular, on the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor.</description>

      <title>The effect of stellar rotation on black hole mass and spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10400v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signature of a binary black hole (BBH) merger is dependent on its component mass and spin. If such black holes originate from rapidly rotating progenitors, the large angular momentum reserve in the star could drive a collapsar-like supernova explosion, hence substantially impacting these characteristics of the black holes in the binary. To examine the effect of stellar rotation on the resulting black hole mass and spin, we conduct a 1D general relativistic study of the end phase of the collapse. We find that the resulting black hole mass at times differs significantly from the previously assumed values. We quantify the dependence of the black hole spin magnitude on the hydrodynamics of the accretion flow, providing analytical relations for calculating the mass and spin based on the progenitor's pre-collapse properties. Depending on the nature of the accretion flow, our findings have implications for the black hole upper mass gap resulting from pair-instability supernovae, the maximum mass of a maximally rotating stellar black hole, and the maximum effective spin of a BBH formed in tidally locked helium star - black hole binary.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray emission from the classical nova AT 2018bej</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical novae are known to demonstrate a supersoft X-ray source (SSS) state following outbursts, which is associated with residual thermonuclear burning on the white dwarf (WD) surface. During its all-sky survey (eRASS1), the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma observatory discovered a bright new SSS, whose position is consistent with the known classical nova AT 2018bej in the Large Magellanic Cloud. There were two eROSITA spectra obtained during eRASS1 and eRASS2 monitoring epochs and one XMM-Newton grating spectrum close to the eRASS1 epoch. We aim to describe the eROSITA and XMM-Newton spectra of AT 2018bej with our local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmosphere models. We focused on the evolution of the hot WD properties between the eRASS1 and eRASS2 epochs, especially on the change of the carbon abundance. A grid of LTE model atmosphere spectra were calculated for different values of the effective temperature (from $T_{\rm eff}= 525$ to $700\,\rm kK$), surface gravity (six values) and chemical composition with five different values of carbon and nitrogen abundances. Both eRASS1 and XMM $0.3-0.6$ keV spectral analyses yield a temperature of the WD of $T_{\rm eff}{\sim}\,600\, \rm kK$ and a WD radius of $8000-8700\,\rm km$. Simultaneous fitting of the eROSITA spectra for two epochs (eRASS1 and eRASS2) with a common WD mass parameter demonstrates a decrease in $T_{\rm eff}$ accompanied by an increase in the WD radius and a decrease in the carbon abundance. However, these changes are marginal and coincide within errors. The derived WD mass is estimated to be $1.05-1.15\, M_\odot$. We traced a minor evolution of the source on a half-year timescale accompanied by a decrease in carbon abundance and concluded that LTE model atmospheres can be used to analyse the available X-ray spectra of classical novae during their SSS stage.</description>

      <title>The Polstar UV Spectropolarimetry Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Polstar small explorer concept is for an ultraviolet (UV) spectropolarimetry space telescope mission with a focus on massive star astrophysics. The instrument waveband will be from 115 nm - 286 nm for spectroscopy and 122 nm - 286 nm for polarimetry. All 4 Stokes parameters, IQUV, will be measured at a resolving power of R=20,000 (15 km/s velocity resolution). The telescope aperture will be 40 cm with an effective area of about 22 cm^2 at a reference wavelength of 150 nm. The thrust of the science goals will be to determine the astrophysics of angular momentum exchange and transport, and consequences for massive star properties and evolution. This includes the effects of rapid to critical rotation for individual stars (magnetic and non-magnetic), and the effects of mass transfer for massive binaries, including identification of stripped core stars. If selected by the NASA/SMEX program, Polstar would launch around 2031 and observe ~300 stars to achieve science goals. The mission will include a Guest Observer program to advance discovery in other areas of astrophysics.</description>
