      <title>Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in a quantum fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal geometries exhibit complex structures with scale invariance self-similar pattern over various length scales. An artificially designed quantum fractal geometry embedded in a uniform magnetic flux has been explored in this study. It has been found that due to quantum mechanical effect, such quantum fractal display an exotic electronic property which is reflected in its transport characteristics. Owing to this uniform magnetic flux piercing through each closed-loop building block of the fractal structure, an electron traversing through such a fractal geometry will pick up a nontrivial Aharonov-Bohm phase factor, which will influence its transport through the system. It is shown that, one can completely block the transmission of an electron in this fractal geometry by setting the value of the uniform magnetic flux to half flux quantum. This phenomenon of Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in this quantum fractal geometry has been supported by the computation of the energy spectrum, two-terminal transport and persistent current in its various generations. This result is very robust against disorder and could be useful in designing efficient quantum algorithms using a quantum fractal network.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions and Cluster Formation: Boosting Surface Thermopower in Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates the thermoelectric properties of magnetic topological insulators (TIs), with a focus on the effects of magnetic atom exchange interactions on the thermopower of their surfaces. Our findings demonstrate that interactions among magnetic atoms significantly enhance the Seebeck coefficient. The formation of magnetic clusters through exchange interactions increases the scattering of Dirac electrons, thereby improving the thermoelectric power factor. We conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations across various configurations, including ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bulk materials, comparing magnetic clustering in Ising and Heisenberg models. Special attention was given to cluster definitions related to surface critical temperatures. Our analysis indicates that the size and number of magnetic clusters influence relaxation times, as well as electrical and thermal resistivities, ultimately affecting the thermopower. Optimized interlayer and intralayer interactions can elevate the surface thermopower of TIs to values comparable to those observed in antiferromagnetic ${\rm MnTe}$, renowned for its unique spin-based thermoelectric properties. This work highlights the potential of magnetic TIs for thermoelectric applications and sets the stage for future research.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Magnetometry of Edge Magnetism in WS2 Flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnets are of significant interest both as a platform for exploring novel fundamental physics and for their potential applications in spintronic and optoelectronic devices. Recent magnetic bulk measurements have indicated a weak ferromagnetic response in WS2 and theoretical predictions suggest that the edges of such flakes exhibit magnetization when at least one edge of a flake is partially hydrogenated. Here, we use room-temperature wide-field quantum diamond magnetometry to image pristine and Fe-implanted WS2 thin flakes of variable thickness, exfoliated from a bulk crystal and transferred to nitrogen-vacancy (NV)-doped diamond substrates. We provide the first direct evidence of edge-localized stray fields, growing linearly with the applied magnetic field and reaching up to 4.7 uT. Magnetic simulations using alternative models favor the presence of edge magnetization aligned along an axis slightly tilted from the normal to the WS2 flake plane. Our observations open intriguing opportunities on the use of WS2 for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor quantum well magnetic memory using confinement from proximity exchange fields for high magnetoresistances in a field-effect transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing demand for highly-performant memories and memristive technologies for use in in-memory computing. Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have thus far addressed this need in the field of spintronics. Despite their low write power and high speeds, MTJs are limited by their modest on/off ratio at room temperature, which motivates a search for beyond-MTJ spintronic devices. In this work, we propose a device that uses two layers of ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) cladding a semiconductor QW, which is able to modulate the QW bandgap via electronic confinement resulting from proximity magnetization at the interfaces of the quantum well depending on the relative magnetization of the FMI layers. We predict that this device has the potential for very high magnetoresistances (MRs) possibly exceeding 10,000% at room temperature. We also predict that this device will operate with maximal MR in charge neutrality, and that electrostatic gating may promote the device to act as a magnetic memtransistor. This motivates the search for candidate materials and ultimately experimental demonstration of magnetic QW memories or memtransistors, which may have the potential to advance the state of the art in logic, memory, or neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>Qubit based on 0-$\pi$ Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the static properties of 0-$\pi$ Josephson junctions, with particular emphasis on their application in superconducting quantum circuits. Using a theoretical framework based on the sine-Gordon equation, we analyze the phase evolution for 0-$\pi$ junctions under various boundary and excitation conditions. These junctions, characterized by spatially varying phase shifts, offer promising configurations for qubit implementations due to their intrinsic symmetry and potential robustness against decoherence. We explore the energy landscape, quantized levels, and switching dynamics relevant for qubit state manipulation. Additionally, we present models for phase, flux, and charge qubit designs, emphasizing their operational principles and readout mechanisms. This work provides insights into the engineering of Josephson-based qubits and supports their continued development as scalable components for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-broken magneto-toroidal artificial spin ices: magnetization states and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-toroidal artificial spin ices (MT-ASIs) are arrangements of nanomagnets that exhibit spontaneous toroidization. A ferrotoroidic order could have implications on the propagation of spin waves through this artificial spin ice, including the development of topological edge modes. Here, we numerically investigate the magnetization dynamics of an MT-ASI with and without spatial symmetry breaking. Through micromagnetic simulations, we compute the energies and ferromagnetic resonance spectra of the four lowest-order states, which exhibit ferrotoroidicity, antiferrotoroidicity, and no toroidicity. As expected, we find that the resonant modes split when spatial symmetry is broken. To determine whether our system exhibits topologically protected edge modes, we perform semi-analytical calculations to first estimate the ferromagnetic resonance and then compute the band structure. Our results show that symmetry-broken MT-ASIs are reconfigurable by magnetic field protocols, and that their band structures depend on magnetization state. Calculation of the Chern number indicates that the bands are topologically trivial in all cases, suggesting that the dynamic magnetic coupling is weak. The absence of a non-zero Chern number is proof of the weak dynamic coupling in ASIs, which must be addressed to unlock their full potential in magnonics applications.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations with large spin splitting in highmobility Al0.8Ga0.2Sb/InAs/ Al0.8Ga0.2Sb quantum-well heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the epitaxial growth of high-quality Al0.8Ga0.2Sb-InAs-Al0.8Ga0.2Sb quantum well films featured by high carrier mobility and strong spin-orbit coupling. By appropriately optimizing the Al-to-Ga ratio in the AlGaSb barrier layer, the quantum confinement of the heterostructure is significantlyenhanced, which results in both an ultra-high electron mobility of 924000 cm2/Vs and a giant magnetoresistance ratio of 365000 at low temperatures. Meanwhile, pronounced Shubnikov-deHaas quantum oscillations persist up to 30 K, and their single-frequency feature indicates a well defined Fermi surface without subband mixing in the two-dimensional electron gas channel. Moreover, the large effective g-factor of 12.93 leads to the observation of Zeeman splitting at large magnetic fields. Our results validate the AlGaSb/InAs quantum well heterostructures as a suitable candidate for constructing energy-efficient topological spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Conservative Join with memory in token-based Brownian circuits and its thermodynamic cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The token-based Brownian circuit harnesses the Brownian motion of particles for computation. The conservative join (CJoin) is a circuit element that synchronizes two Brownian particles, and its realization using repelling particles, such as magnetic skyrmions or electrons, is key to building the Brownian circuit. Here, a theoretical implementation of the CJoin using a simple quantum dot circuit is proposed, incorporating an internal state-a double quantum dot that functions as a one-bit memory, storing the direction of two-particle transfer. A periodic reset protocol is introduced, allowing the CJoin to emit particles in a specific direction. The stochastic thermodynamics under periodic resets identifies the thermodynamic cost as the work done for resets minus the entropy reduction due to resets, with its lower bound remaining within a few multiples of $k_{\rm B} T$ at temperature $T$. Applying the speed limit relation to a subsystem in bipartite dynamics, the number of emitted particles is shown to be relatively tightly bounded from above by an expression involving the subsystem's irreversible entropy production rate and dynamical activity rate.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic layer polarization and multi-flatband transport in non-centrosymmetric mixed-stacked multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene multilayers exhibit electronic spectra that depend sensitively on both the number of layers and their stacking order. Beyond trilayer graphene, mixed stacking sequences (alternating Bernal and rhombohedral layers) give rise to multiple coexisting low-energy bands. Here we investigate ABCBC-stacked pentalayer graphene, a less-studied non-centrosymmetric mixed sequence. This stacking can be regarded as an ABC (rhombohedral) trilayer on top of an AB (Bernal) bilayer, so its low-energy band structure contains both a cubic band and a parabolic band that hybridize. In transport measurements, we observe an intrinsic band gap at charge neutrality whose magnitude changes asymmetrically under an applied perpendicular displacement field. This behavior reflects the spontaneous layer polarization inherent to the broken inversion symmetry and mirror symmetry. By tuning the displacement field and carrier density, we drive multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Fermi surface topology and realize Landau levels with different degeneracies arising from the multi-flatband system. Remarkably, a v = -6 quantum Hall state emerges at an exceptionally low magnetic field (~20 mT), indicating the interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and Berry curvatures. Our results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a tunable platform with various broken symmetries and multiple flatbands, suitable for exploring emergent correlated electronic states.</description>

      <title>Voltage-tuned anomalous-metal to metal transition in hybrid Josephson junction arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report voltage-tuned phase transitions in arrays of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor islands arranged in a square lattice. A double-layer electrostatic gate geometry enables independent tuning of inter-island coupling and proximity-induced superconductivity. This design enables access to the superconductor-insulator, superconductor-metal, and metal-insulator transitions in a single device, revealing critical points and emergent intermediate phases. We find that the superconductor-insulator transition is interrupted by an anomalous metallic phase with saturating low-temperature resistivity. Across gate voltages, this regime extends over three orders of magnitude in resistivity and can be continuously tuned into the conventional metallic phase. The signature of the anomalous metallic phase is suppressed by magnetic frustration.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge-to-spin conversion under quantum confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the B\"uttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Anomalous persistent current in a 1D dimerized ring with aperiodic site potential: Non-interacting and interacting cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the magnetic response by examining flux-driven circular currents in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) tight-binding (TB) ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux, $\phi$. We consider both non-interacting and interacting electrons, where site energies are modulated by a slowly varying cosine form. Repulsive electron-electron interaction is incorporated through an on-site Hubbard term, and we analyze the system using the Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-field (MF) approximation. We discuss the characteristics of flux-driven circular currents to aperiodic potentials, dimerized hopping integrals, and Hubbard interactions. For the chosen aperiodic potential, both the strength and configuration play a crucial role, and we explore these aspects in depth. Interestingly, we observe a counterintuitive delocalizing effect as the aperiodic potential increases, unlike in conventional disordered rings. The effects of system size, filling factor, the presence of circular spin current, and the accuracy of MF results are also discussed. Finally, we provide a brief description of possible experimental realizations of our chosen quantum system. This investigation can be extended to explore additional properties in various loop substructures, promising further insights.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport mapping in twisted double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant interest due to their tunable physical properties when stacked into heterostructures. Twisting adjacent layers introduces moire patterns that strongly influence the material's electronic and thermal behavior. In twisted graphene systems, the twist angle critically alters phonon transport, leading to reduced thermal conductivity compared to Bernal-stacked configurations. However, experimental investigations into thermal transport in twisted structures remain limited. Here, we study the local thermal properties of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) using Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). We find a reduction in thermal resistance of 0.3 +/- 0.1 x 10^6 K W^-1 compared to untwisted bilayers, attributed to changes in both intrinsic thermal conductivity and the tip-sample interface. These results, supported by analytical modeling, provide new insight into thermal transport mechanisms in twisted 2D systems and offer a pathway toward thermal engineering in twistronic devices.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Acceptor Wave Function Anisotropy in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of hydrogenic acceptor wave functions in silicon. These acceptor states appear as square ring-like features in STM images and originate from near-surface defects introduced by high-energy bismuth implantation into a silicon (001) wafer. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy confirms the formation of a p-type surface. Effective-mass and tight-binding calculations provide an excellent description of the observed square ring-like features, confirming their acceptor character and attributing their symmetry to the light- and heavy-hole band degeneracy in silicon. Detailed understanding of the energetic and spatial properties of acceptor wave functions in silicon is essential for engineering large-scale acceptor-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13200</link>

Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the meaning of the concept of activity itself. Here, we introduce a generalized dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling and derive a steady-state quantum KUR (QKUR) expressed in terms of this generalized activity. Explicit expressions are obtained within Green's function and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms. This QKUR ensures that uncertainty relations are valid across all coupling strengths, offering a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>A Family of Aperiodic Tilings with Tunable Quantum Geometric Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strict geometric rules that define aperiodic tilings lead to the unique spectral and transport properties of quasicrystals, but also limit our ability to design them. In this work, we explore the first continuously tunable family of two-dimensional aperiodic tilings in which the underlying real-space geometry becomes a control knob of the wave-function's quantum geometric tensor. The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Indistinguishability to Classical Distinguishability: Statistics and Measurement of Two-Particle Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.</description>

      <title>Josephson Junctions in the Age of Quantum Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique combination of energy conservation and nonlinear behavior exhibited by Josephson junctions has driven transformative advances in modern quantum technologies based on superconducting circuits. These superconducting devices underpin essential developments across quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communication and open pathways to innovative applications in nonreciprocal electronics. These developments are enabled by recent breakthroughs in nanofabrication and characterization methodologies, substantially enhancing device performance and scalability. The resulting innovations reshape our understanding of quantum systems and enable practical applications. This perspective explores the foundational role of Josephson junctions research in propelling quantum technologies forward. We underscore the critical importance of synergistic progress in material science, device characterization, and nanofabrication to catalyze the next wave of breakthroughs and accelerate the transition from fundamental discoveries to industrial-scale quantum utilities. Drawing parallels with the transformative impact of transistor-based integrated circuits during the Information Age, we envision Josephson junction-based circuits as central to driving a similar revolution in the emerging Quantum Age.</description>

      <title>Resolving self-cavity effects in two-dimensional quantum materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials and van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures host many strongly correlated and topological quantum phases on the $\sim$ meV energy scale. Direct electrodynamical signatures of such states are thus expected to appear in the terahertz (THz) frequency range (1 THz $\sim$ 4 meV). Because the typical size of vdW heterostructures ($\sim$10 $\mu m$) is much smaller than the diffraction limit of THz light, probing THz optical conductivities necessitates the use of near-field optical probes. However, interpreting the response of such near-field probes is complicated by finite-size effects, the presence of electrostatic gates, and the influence of the probe itself on material dynamics -- all of which conspire to form polaritonic self-cavities, in which interactions between THz electromagnetic fields and material excitations form discretized standing waves. In this paper, we demonstrate the relevance of self-cavity effects in 2D materials and derive an analytical framework to resolve these effects using the emerging experimental technique of time-domain on-chip THz spectroscopy. We show that by pairing experiments with the analytical theory, it is possible to extract the THz conductivity and resolve collective mode dynamics far outside the light cone, with $\sim \mu m$ in-plane and $\sim nm$ out-of-plane resolution. This study lays the groundwork for studying quantum phases and cavity effects in vdW heterostructures and 2D quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly on the experimentally observed (111) plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy forms a prismatic dislocation loop on the (111) plane for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.</description>

      <title>Single-Ion Spectroscopy of h-BN Point Defect Fluorescence in Liquid Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the chemical state of individual ions in solutions is crucial for advancing knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, analyzing systems at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a significant challenge. We present a strategy that leverages the optical emission properties of point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as sensitive ion detectors. The interaction of optically active h-BN defects with ions in solution leads to distinct spectral shifts, enabling precise visualization and analyzing of individual ions. Using Li+ ions in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed spectral shifts exceeding 10 nm upon ion addition. Application of an external electric field further enhanced these shifts to over 40 nm, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical field induced local perturbations of Li+ ions. Following this approach, we showed that each individual single point defect can be used to spectroscopically distinguish ions of varying charges (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+) based on their local electric fields, each producing a distinct spectral shift. This platform allows direct visualization of ions and their chemical states in liquid environments, providing insights into subtle interfacial changes at the single-ion level, with measurable spectral shifts detectable at millisecond temporal resolution and at concentrations down to the millimolar range. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids that include battery technology and environmental science.</description>

      <title>The mechanism of electrical conduction in glassy semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the dominant charge carrier in glassy semiconducting alloys is a compound particle in the form of an electron or hole bound to an intimate pair of topological lattice defects; the particle is similar to the polaron solution of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian. The spatial component of the density of states for these special polarons is determined by the length scale of spatial modulation of electronegativity caused by a separate set of standalone topological defects. The latter length scale is fixed by the cooperativity size for structural relaxation; the size is largely independent of temperature in the glass but above melting, it decreases with temperature. Thus we predict that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity should exhibit a jump in the slope near the glass transition; the size of the jump is predicted to increase with the fragility of the melt. The predicted values of the jump and of the conductivity itself are consistent with experiment.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on transition probabilities of small-scale quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.</description>

      <title>Ordered states in AB bilayer graphene in SU(4)-symmetric model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply SU(4)-symmetric model to examine possible ordered states in AB stacked bilayer graphene (AB-BLG). The Hamiltonian of the system possesses this symmetry under certain assumptions. In such a model the multicomponent order parameter can be presented as a $4\times4$ matrix $\hat{Q}$. Using a mean field approximation, we derive a self-consistency equation for $\hat{Q}$. Among possible solutions of the obtained equation there are anomalous quantum Hall states, spin, charge, spin-valley density waves, inter-layer excitonic phases and their combinations. We argue that the proposed approach is a useful tool for classification of the ordered states in AB-BLG. The ordered states of the SU(4)-symmetric model demonstrate extensive degeneracies. The degeneracies can be removed by taking into account the neglected non-SU(4)-symmetric terms, disorder, substrate, as well as other perturbations. The ordered states have varying sensitivity to these factors. This suggests that, for AB-BLG, a ground state ordering type is a non-universal property, susceptible to particulars of extrinsic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that Terahertz sensors can effectively detect the spin resonances of Dirac fermions in graphene. The associated photovoltaic measurement technique allows for the investigation of the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene as well as its topological properties from microwave to Terahertz frequencies. In this work, using graphene/MoS2-based Field-Effect Transistors, we observed a magnetic resonance photovoltage signal in the Gigahertz range that is independent of the gate bias. The dispersion of the associated spin-flip transitions remains intriguingly unaffected by the MoS2 layer. In parallel, the spin-related signal consistently appears as a drop in photovoltage, regardless of the signal's polarity or origin, whether it arises from plasma wave rectification or thermoelectric effects. This behavior is interpreted as a decrease in the system's spin polarization due to spin-dependent recombination or scattering of photocarriers. Understanding the various photovoltaic signals in highly sensitive Gigahertz/Terahertz sensors paves the way for exploring spin-dependent mechanisms in two-dimensional quantum materials, influenced by proximity effects such as spin-orbit coupling, topology, and magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave gap is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeema field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider macroscopic motion of $^3$He-A in global thermodynamic equilibrium within the context of the Zubarev statistical operator method. We formulate the corresponding effective theory in the language of the functional integral. The effective Lagrangian comprising macroscopic motion of fermionic excitations is calculated explicitly for the emergent relativistic fermions of the superfluid $^3$He-A-phase in the non-trivial bosonic background due to a space and time dependent matrix-valued vierbein featuring nonzero torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan anomaly. The matrix-valued vierbein formulation comprises an additional two dimensional internal spin space which may be replaced by one featuring a fermionic theory with a real valued vierbein, two Abelian gauge fields and a spin connection mixing the Dirac and internal spin spaces. As an application of the developed theory we consider macroscopic rotation around the axis of the pure integer mass vortices. The corresponding thermodynamical quantities of the normal component are analysed.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons with non-zero Hopf index ${\cal H}$ in the vector field of material's local magnetization. In this Letter elliptical stability of hopfions with ${\cal H}=1$ in a classical helimagnet is studied on the basis of a variational model. It is shown that, depending on their internal structure (vortex and antivortex tubes ordering), the hopfions can either be stable in a bulk magnet or unstable with respect to elongation along their central axis. It is found that the energy of stable hopfions is always below the energy of the $2\pi$-skyrmion lattice in the same material, suggesting the possibility to use $2\pi$-skyrmions as a precursor for hopfion nucleation. Stability diagram for hopfions on the magnetic anisotropy-field phase diagram is computed numerically. Explicit analytical expressions for some of its critical lines are derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an equivalent circuit model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) that accurately captures their magnetization dynamics and electrical behavior. Implemented in LTspice, the model is validated against direct numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. It effectively simulates essential spintronic phenomena, including ferromagnetic resonance, field- and spin-torque-induced switching, and spin-torque-induced oscillations. Simulation results demonstrate strong agreement between LTspice and LLGS solutions, confirming the model accuracy and utility for efficient circuit-level analysis of spintronic devices. The ability to incorporate time-dependent magnetic fields and voltage inputs makes the proposed model suitable for diverse applications such as neuromorphic computing, microwave signal processing, and spintronic memory technologies. By providing a computationally efficient yet physically accurate circuit representation, this work enables seamless integration of MTJs into larger electronic systems, potentially accelerating the development of advanced spintronic circuit architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.</description>

      <title>Large Thermopower with Sign-Alternating Quantum Oscillations in Insulating Monolayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of Landau-level-like energy structures near the chemical potential of an insulator is essential to the search for a class of correlated electronic matter hosting charge-neutral fermions and Fermi surfaces, a long-proposed concept that remains elusive experimentally. Here we introduce and demonstrate that the magneto-thermoelectric response of a quantum insulator can reveal critical information not available via other approaches. We report the observation of large Seebeck response together with quantum oscillations (QOs) in the hole-doped insulating state of monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) in magnetic fields. The measured low temperature magneto-thermopower exceeds k_B/e by more than an order of magnitude, where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and e the elementary charge. This large thermopower is a characteristic of an insulating state, consistent with high resistivity. However, as the magnetic field is swept, QOs develop in the thermopower, which remarkably undergoes sign-changes that mimic the quantum characteristic of metals due to Landau quantization. The sign-change in the thermoelectric response directly implies the presence of a field-induced Landau-level-like structure at the chemical potential of the insulator. Neither the large thermopower nor the sign-changes can be induced by the metallic gate nearby. Our results demonstrate a new dilemma for investigating low energy excitations in correlated materials featuring mixed quantum characteristics of metals and insulators.</description>

      <title>Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.</description>

      <title>Terahertz chiral photonic-crystal cavities for Dirac gap engineering in graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>A strong-driving toolkit for topological Floquet energy pumps with superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Floquet energy pumps -- which use periodic driving to create a topologically protected quantized energy current -- have been proposed and studied theoretically, but have never been observed directly. Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.</description>

      <title>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. They reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.</description>

      <title>Strain-Gradient and Curvature-Induced Changes in Domain Morphology of BaTiO3 Nanorods: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of OH- ions incorporation on the lattice strain and spontaneous polarization of BaTiO3 nanorods synthesized under different conditions. It was confirmed that the lattice strain depends directly on Ba supersaturation, with higher supersaturation leading to an increase in the lattice strain. However, it was shown that crystal growth and observed lattice distortion are not primarily influenced by external strain; rather, OH- ions incorporation plays a key role in generating internal chemical strains and driving these processes. By using the less reactive TiO2 precursor instead of TiOCl2 and controlling Ba supersaturation, the slower nucleation rate enables more effective regulation of OH- ions incorporation and crystal growth. This in turn effects both particle size and lattice distortion, leading to c/a ratio of 1.013 - 1.014. The incorporation of OH- ions induces lattice elongation along the c-axis, contributing to anisotropic growth, increasing of the rod diameter and their growth-induced bending. However, the possibility of the curvature-induced changes in domain morphology of BaTiO3 nanorods remains almost unexplored. To study the possibility, we perform analytical calculations and finite element modeling, which provide insights into the curvature-induced changes in the strain-gradient, polarization distribution, and domain morphology in BaTiO3 nanorods. Theoretical results reveal the appearance of the domain stripes in BaTiO3 nanorod when the curvature exceeds a critical angle. The physical origin of the domain stripes emergence is the tendency to minimize its elastic energy of the nanorod by the domain splitting. These findings suggest that BaTiO3 nanorods, with curvature-controllable amount of domain stripes, could serve as flexible race-track memory elements for flexo-tronics and domain-wall electronics.</description>
