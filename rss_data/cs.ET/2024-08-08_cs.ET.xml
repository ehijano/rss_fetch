      <title>Quantum Computing and Neuromorphic Computing for Safe, Reliable, and explainable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Optimal Control in Autonomous Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the utilization of Quantum Computing and Neuromorphic Computing for Safe, Reliable, and Explainable Multi_Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in the context of optimal control in autonomous robotics. The objective was to address the challenges of optimizing the behavior of autonomous agents while ensuring safety, reliability, and explainability. Quantum Computing techniques, including Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), were employed to efficiently explore large solution spaces and find approximate solutions to complex MARL problems. Neuromorphic Computing, inspired by the architecture of the human brain, provided parallel and distributed processing capabilities, which were leveraged to develop intelligent and adaptive systems. The combination of these technologies held the potential to enhance the safety, reliability, and explainability of MARL in autonomous robotics. This research contributed to the advancement of autonomous robotics by exploring cutting-edge technologies and their applications in multi-agent systems. Codes and data are available.</description>

      <title>The Ontoverse: Democratising Access to Knowledge Graph-based Data Through a Cartographic Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of scientific publications and preprints is growing exponentially, several attempts have been made to navigate this complex and increasingly detailed landscape. These have almost exclusively taken unsupervised approaches that fail to incorporate domain knowledge and lack the structural organisation required for intuitive interactive human exploration and discovery. Especially in highly interdisciplinary fields, a deep understanding of the connectedness of research works across topics is essential for generating insights. We have developed a unique approach to data navigation that leans on geographical visualisation and uses hierarchically structured domain knowledge to enable end-users to explore knowledge spaces grounded in their desired domains of interest. This can take advantage of existing ontologies, proprietary intelligence schemata, or be directly derived from the underlying data through hierarchical topic modelling. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques to extract named entities from the underlying data and normalise them against relevant domain references and navigational structures. The knowledge is integrated by first calculating similarities between entities based on their shared extracted feature space and then by alignment to the navigational structures. The result is a knowledge graph that allows for full text and semantic graph query and structured topic driven navigation. This allows end-users to identify entities relevant to their needs and access extensive graph analytics. The user interface facilitates graphical interaction with the underlying knowledge graph and mimics a cartographic map to maximise ease of use and widen adoption. We demonstrate an exemplar project using our generalisable and scalable infrastructure for an academic biomedical literature corpus that is grounded against hundreds of different named domain entities.</description>

      <title>MarQSim: Reconciling Determinism and Randomness in Compiler Optimization for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation, fundamental in quantum algorithm design, extends far beyond its foundational roots, powering diverse quantum computing applications. However, optimizing the compilation of quantum Hamiltonian simulation poses significant challenges. Existing approaches fall short in reconciling deterministic and randomized compilation, lack appropriate intermediate representations, and struggle to guarantee correctness. Addressing these challenges, we present MarQSim, a novel compilation framework. MarQSim leverages a Markov chain-based approach, encapsulated in the Hamiltonian Term Transition Graph, adeptly reconciling deterministic and randomized compilation benefits. We rigorously prove its algorithmic efficiency and correctness criteria. Furthermore, we formulate a Min-Cost Flow model that can tune transition matrices to enforce correctness while accommodating various optimization objectives. Experimental results demonstrate MarQSim's superiority in generating more efficient quantum circuits for simulating various quantum Hamiltonians while maintaining precision.</description>

      <title>Molecular Absorption-Aware User Assignment, Spectrum, and Power Allocation in Dense THz Networks with Multi-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework to maximize the network sum-rate in a multi-user, multi-BS downlink terahertz (THz) network by optimizing user associations, number and bandwidth of sub-bands in a THz transmission window (TW), bandwidth of leading and trailing edge-bands in a TW, sub-band assignment, and power allocations. The proposed framework incorporates multi-connectivity and captures the impact of molecular absorption coefficient variations in a TW, beam-squint, molecular absorption noise, and link blockages. To make the problem tractable, we first propose a convex approximation of the molecular absorption coefficient using curve fitting in a TW, determine the feasible bandwidths of the leading and trailing edge-bands, and then derive closed-form optimal solution for the number of sub-bands considering beam-squint constraints. We then decompose joint user associations, sub-band assignment, and power allocation problem into two sub-problems, i.e., \textbf{(i)} joint user association and sub-band assignment, and \textbf{(ii)} power allocation. To solve the former problem, we analytically prove the unimodularity of the constraint matrix which enables us to relax the integer constraint without loss of optimality. To solve power allocation sub-problem, a fractional programming (FP)-based centralized solution as well as an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based light-weight distributed solution is proposed. The overall problem is then solved using alternating optimization until convergence. Complexity analysis of the algorithms and numerical convergence are presented. Numerical findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and extract useful insights about the interplay of the density of base stations (BSs), Average order of multi-connectivity (AOM), molecular absorption, {hardware impairment}, {imperfect CSI}, and link blockages.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Approach for Selecting the Best Quantum Solver for an Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging quantum computers for optimization problems holds promise across various application domains. Nevertheless, utilizing respective quantum computing solvers requires describing the optimization problem according to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formalism and selecting a proper solver for the application of interest with a reasonable setting. Both demand significant proficiency in quantum computing, QUBO formulation, and quantum solvers, a background that usually cannot be assumed by end users who are domain experts rather than quantum computing specialists. While tools aid in QUBO formulations, support for selecting the best-solving approach remains absent. This becomes even more challenging because selecting the best solver for a problem heavily depends on the problem itself. In this work, we are accepting this challenge and propose a predictive selection approach, which aids end users in this task. To this end, the solver selection task is first formulated as a classification task that is suitable to be solved by supervised machine learning. Based on that, we then propose strategies for adjusting solver parameters based on problem size and characteristics. Experimental evaluations, considering more than 500 different QUBO problems, confirm the benefits of the proposed solution. In fact, we show that in more than 70% of the cases, the best solver is selected, and in about 90% of the problems, a solver in the top two, i.e., the best or its closest suboptimum, is selected. This exploration proves the potential of machine learning in quantum solver selection and lays the foundations for its automation, broadening access to quantum optimization for a wider range of users.</description>

      <title>Solving rescheduling problems in heterogeneous urban railway networks using hybrid quantum-classical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the applicability of hybrid quantum-classical heuristics for practical railway rescheduling management problems. We build an integer linear model for the given problem and solve it with D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver as well as with CPLEX for comparison. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a real-life heterogeneous urban network in Poland, including both single- and multi-track segments and covers all the requirements posed by the operator of the network. The computational results demonstrate the readiness for application and benefits of quantum-classical hybrid solvers in the realistic railway scenario: they yield acceptable solutions on time, which is a critical requirement in a rescheduling situation. At the same time, the solutions that were obtained were feasible. Moreover, though they are probabilistic (heuristics) they offer a valid alternative by returning a range of possible solutions the dispatcher can choose from. And, most importantly, they outperform classical solvers in some cases.</description>
