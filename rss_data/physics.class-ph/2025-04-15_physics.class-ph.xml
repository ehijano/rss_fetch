      <title>Symmetry Analysis of Proper-Time Maxwell's Equations: Invariant Solutions and Physical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gill and Zachary's proper-time reformulation of Maxwell's equations introduces a source-dependent speed b = sqrt(c^2 + u^2), distinct from standard electrodynamics. This study applies Lie symmetry analysis to the resulting wave equations, yielding new invariant solutions, conservation laws, and physical interpretations. In the one-dimensional case, we derive E(x, tau) = A x / tau + B + k * integral of rho(x) dx, revealing radiative behavior linked to b. Conservation laws via self-adjointness, singularity analysis near tau = 0, and simulations of accelerating charges extend Gill and Zachary's framework. The findings suggest new insights into propagation and energy dynamics, clarified as coordinate effects rather than violations of causality, offering fresh perspectives on relativistic electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Fundamental longitudinal electromagnetic (EM) force investigation using DC current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to investigate historical claims of the existence of a longitudinal ElectroMagnetic (EM) force component acting on metallic atomic current elements in a direction parallel to the current flowing through them. This lies outside conventional textbook physics predictions, yet its existence has been indicated previously and if eventually confirmed will have a significant effect on physics theory and many technological applications, especially those involving high current density (&gt; 10^9 A/m2). The experiment described here is based on the measurement of force on a copper armature submerged in a trough containing liquid metal through which constant DC current is passing. The coaxial symmetry of the experiment (CRE Coaxial Recoil Experiment) was able to limit all net force on the centred armature to the direction of interest, parallel to the current within it. All the experimental data related the measured forces on the armature to the current flowing through the circuit. Variations were made to the length and location of the armature along the central axis as well as modifications to the liquid metal configuration. Raw and processed results are presented, and an experimental technique described that revealed strong evidence for the existence of and discrimination between axial mechanical contact forces and longitudinal EM force. The original EM force law, proposed in 1822 by Ampere, includes a longitudinal component and has been found to be qualitatively consistent with all experiments to date, including these reported findings, and is considered a candidate explanatory theory.</description>

      <title>A generic framework for extending Miles' approach to wind-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the energy transfer from wind to waves is an important but complex topic, typically based on phenomenology or on technically challenging analysis, performed case by case. Here we show that the approach by Miles, initially proposed for a still and infinitely deep ocean of inviscid water, is in fact generic: it can easily be adapted, as we derive directly from the mathematical structure of the arguments put forward by Miles. We establish simple transformations, which deduce growth rates in complex hydrodynamic situations directly from those in Miles' conditions. The corresponding conversion factors are determined from the hydrodynamic water pressure under the effect of a propagating surface wave, and can be determined without needing to further analyse wind and air flow. We reproduce a variety of results for different hydrodynamic situations to show how such generalisations can be achieved with surprisingly little calculations and without any additional numerical effort, which should make the approach interesting for real-life applications.</description>

      <title>Constants of motion network revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering constants of motion is meaningful in helping understand the dynamical systems, but inevitably needs proficient mathematical skills and keen analytical capabilities. With the prevalence of deep learning, methods employing neural networks, such as Constant Of Motion nETwork (COMET), are promising in handling this scientific problem. Although the COMET method can produce better predictions on dynamics by exploiting the discovered constants of motion, there is still plenty of room to sharpen it. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, built using the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) technique, and a two-phase training algorithm to improve the performance of COMET. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only retains the advantages of COMET, such as applying to non-Hamiltonian systems and indicating the number of constants of motion, but also can be more lightweight and noise-robust than COMET.</description>

      <title>On the Derivation of the Cosmological Gurzadyan's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmology, the Gurzadyan's theorem identifies the most general force law consistent with the finding of Newton's first shell theorem -- that a spherical symmetric mass exerts the same gravitational force as a point mass at its center. This theorem has found important applications in cosmological modeling, particularly in the context of MoND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), which has recently gained renewed attention as a potential alternative to dark matter. The derivation by Gurzadyan is written in an extremely concise and dense style, making it difficult to follow. Recent proofs of the theorem based on power-series methods offer valuable perspectives, though they differ from the original derivation, which is based on perturbation analysis. Our note aims to clarify the underlying logic in a pedagogical way -- accessible to advanced high school or undergraduate students -- while preserving conceptual clarity and mathematical elegance of his insight.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Helicity in Twisted Cavity Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through left- or right-handed twisting, we investigate the impact of mirror-asymmetry (chirality) of the conducting boundary conditions of an equilaterial triangular cross-section electromagnetic resonator. We observe the generation of eigenmodes with non-zero electromagnetic helicity as a result of the coupling of near degenerate TE$_{11(p+1)}$ and TM$_{11p}$ modes. This can be interpreted as an emergence of magneto-electric coupling, which in turn produces a measurable shift in resonant mode frequency as a function of twist angle. We show that this coupling mechanism is equivalent to introducing a non-zero chirality material parameter $\kappa_\text{eff}$ or axion field $\theta_{\text{eff}}$ to the medium. Our findings demonstrate the potential for real-time, macroscopic manipulation of electromagnetic helicity.</description>
