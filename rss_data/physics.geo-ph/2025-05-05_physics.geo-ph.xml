      <title>Modelling spontaneous ductile (viscous) strain localisation on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A characteristic feature of the Earth is that diffuse thermal convection in the mantle produces localized deformation at the surface: Plate Tectonics. However, modelling this phenomenon remains a challenge, due to inability to simulate spontaneous strain localisation in the deep sections of the plates, where rocks deform by ductile processes and behave as highly viscous fluids. Analysis of shear zones - the main expression of strain localisation in nature - reveals that mechanical heterogeneity is key. Here we posit that the bottleneck for self-consistent generation of strain localisation in geodynamical models is poor representation of this heterogeneity and its evolution during deformation, in particular at small scales. To bypass this obstacle, we introduce a stochastic description of the mechanical properties of the rocks, which evolves as a function of the local work rate. This approach not only successfully generates steady-state shear zones from random rheological heterogeneity fields, but reproduces the full range of observations in nature and experiments. It allows defining the necessary conditions and a regime diagram for viscous strain localisation and quantifying the resulting bulk softening, paving the way for self-consistent modelling of the development of plate boundaries and initiation of Plate Tectonics on Earth.</description>

      <title>Power Laws Associated with Self-Organized Criticality: A Comparison of Empirical Data with Model Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relevance of {\sl self-organized criticality (SOC)} models in previously published empirical datasets, which includes statistical observations in astrophysics, geophysics, biophysics, sociophysics, and informatics. We study 25 interdisciplinary phenomena with five different event detection and power law fitting methods. The total number of analyzed size distributions amounts to 64 cases, of which 80\% are found to be nearly consistent ($\alpha_s=1.99\pm0.30$) with the SOC model predictions. The fractal-diffusive SOC model predicts power law slopes of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux $F$, $\alpha_E=(5/3)\sim1.67$ for the fluence or energy $E$, and $\alpha_T=2.00$ for the avalanche duration $T$. We find that the phenomena of solar flares, earthquakes, and forest fires are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the size distributions of other phenomena are not conclusive due to neglected background treatment, inadequacy of power law fitting range, small-number statistics, and finite-system size effects.</description>

      <title>A Model of UV-Blue Absorbance in Bulk Liquid of Venusian Cloud Aerosols Is Consistent with Efficient Organic Absorbers at High Concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At visible wavelengths, Venus appears serene and pale-yellow, but since the 1920s, observers have noted high-contrast features in the ultraviolet. These features track the about 4-day superrotation of the upper cloud deck and vary widely over time and space. The identity of the UV absorber(s)-active between at least 280 and 500 nm-remains unknown, as no proposed candidate fully matches all observational data. From remote observations of Venus, and accounting for light scattering by sub-micrometer droplets, we modeled the 365-455 nm absorbance per cm of the bulk liquids forming Venus's clouds. Assuming a uniform distribution in mode 1 and 2 particles across a 6 km layer below the cloud top at 65 km, we constrain the bulk absorbance with a peak at A375 nm being 2942 per cm. This extremely high absorbance implies the presence of a highly efficient absorber, most likely conjugated organics, at relatively high concentration-e.g. about 25 g/L for porphyrin type pigments. Inorganic absorbers, with molar absorption coefficients typically in the range of 1,000-10,000 per M per cm, would either need to comprise a large portion of the aerosols or are simply not light absorbent enough, even if present in pure form. We emphasize that all candidate absorbers must be evaluated against Venus's reflectance curve using (i) known molar absorption coefficients, (ii) realistic atmospheric distributions, and (iii) appropriate particle size distributions. The upcoming Rocket Lab mission will test the hypothesis of organics in Venus's clouds.</description>
