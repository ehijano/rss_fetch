      <title>Pseudoscalar meson dominance, the pion-nucleon coupling constant and the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix elements of the pseudoscalar density with pion-quantum numbers $I^G J^{PC}= 1^- 0^{-+}$ in the nucleon in terms of dispersion relations, PCAC and pQCD asymptotic sum rules for the pseudoscalar form factor. We show that the corresponding spectral density must have at least one zero. A model based on ChPT at low energies, resonances at intermediate energies, Regge power-like behaviour at high energies and pQCD at asymptotically high energies allows to deduce the pion-nucleon coupling constant and the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy $\Delta_{GT} = 1 -\frac{m_N g_A}{F_{\pi}g_{\pi NN}}$ yielding the results
  \[ g_{\pi NN} = 13.14(^{+7}_{-4}), \quad \Delta_{\rm GT} = 1.26(^{+51}_{-34})\% , \] to be compared with the most precise determinations, $g_{\pi^+ np} = 13.25(5)$ (and hence $\Delta_{\rm GT}=2.1(4) \%$), from $np, pp$ scattering analysis of the Granada-2013 database. Our work supports the concept of pseudoscalar dominance in the nucleon structure suggested by Dominguez long ago. The minimal resonance saturation of the pseudoscalar form factor of the nucleon with the lowest isovector-pseudoscalar mesons compatible with analyticity, pQCD short distance constraints and chiral symmetry leads to an extended PCAC in the large-$N_c$ limit, and effectively depends on the $\pi(1300)$-excited pion state. Our results are compatible, though more accurate, than recent lattice QCD studies and are consistent with almost flat strong pion-nucleon-nucleon vertices.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in a $SO(3)$ non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D with quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of various properties of quantum field theories is rapidly becoming a testing ground for demonstrating the prowess of quantum algorithms. Some examples include the preparation of ground states, as well as the investigation of various simple wave packets relevant for scattering phenomena. In this paper, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian $SO(3)$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states, which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss Law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ans\"{a}tze in the Gauss-Law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links. The experimental/simulation results derived from our theoretical developments indicate the role of metrics--such as the energy and the infidelity--to assess the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method to compute the pion transition form factor directly at arbitrary space-like photon momenta and use it to determine the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. The calculation is performed using eight gauge ensembles generated with 2+1 flavor domain wall fermions, incorporating multiple pion masses, lattice spacings, and volumes. By introducing a pion structure function and performing a Gegenbauer expansion, we demonstrate that about 98\% of the $\pi^0$-pole contribution can be extracted in a model-independent manner, thereby ensuring that systematic effects are well controlled. After applying finite-volume corrections, as well as performing chiral and continuum extrapolations, we obtain the final result for the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, $a_{\mu}^{\pi^0\mathrm{-pole}}=61.2(1.7)\times 10^{-11}$, and the $\pi^0$ decay width, $\Gamma_{\pi^0\to \gamma\gamma}=7.60(27)$ eV.</description>

      <title>Z boson production in proton-lead collisions: A study utilizing MRW nuclear TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the production of Z bosons in proton-lead collisions at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8.16$ TeV, utilizing various transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs), including the leading order Martin-Ryskin-Watt (LO-MRW), next-to-leading order MRW (NLO-MRW), and parton branching (PB) approaches. By comparing theoretical predictions with experimental data from the CMS collaboration, we assess the performance of these TMD models across different kinematic regions. Our analysis reveals that while both LO-MRW and NLO-MRW models generally align well with experimental data, the LO-MRW model tends to overestimate in certain kinematic regions. The NLO-MRW model, with its strong ordering constraint, provides better agreement in these areas. This study highlights the impact of different impositions of angular and strong ordering constraints in the LO-MRW and NLO-MRW approaches in describing Z boson production.</description>

      <title>Dominance of gluonic scale anomaly in confining pressure inside nucleon and D-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the confining pressure inside the nucleon and the related gravitational form factor referred to as the D-term, using the skyrmion approach based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory, where the skyrmion is described as the nucleon and a scalar meson couples to the scale anomaly through the low energy theorem. Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ baryons in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (HB$\chi$PT), a non-relativistic effective field theory that treats baryons as heavy static sources, to calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of spin-3/2 baryons in two sectors: the light-flavor decuplet baryons and singly heavy sextet baryons. We derive the analytical expressions up to $\mathcal{O}\left(p^3\right)$. Our results indicate that the long-range chiral corrections provide substantial contributions to the polarizabilities. In addition, magnetic dipole (M1) transitions of the baryons can significantly affect the magnetic polarizabilities and may even reverse their signs. For the decuplet baryons, the $\Delta^+$ and $\Delta^0$ exhibit the largest electric polarizabilities. Their values, $\alpha_E(\Delta^+) = (17.5 \pm 9.5)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(\Delta^0) = (17.0 \pm 9.3)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$, significantly exceed those typically observed for nucleons. Meanwhile, the electric polarizabilities of spin-3/2 singly heavy baryons are comparable to those of their spin-1/2 partners.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Muon Anomaly from $e^+ e^-\to$ Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly) from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below the $\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and the QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces\,: $a_\mu\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\pm 37)\times 10^{-11} $.Including the Higher Order $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the Hadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW) contributions, one obtains\,: $\Delta a_\mu^{pheno}\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{pheno}= (81\pm 41)\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent experimental value $a_\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates the previous one in Ref.[1], after adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions, and can be compared with the one from the most precise Lattice result $\Delta a_\mu^{lattice}= (90\pm 56)\times 10^{-11}$. Then, we deduce the (tentative) SM prediction average : $\Delta a_\mu^{SM} = (87\pm 33)\times 10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by revising our predictions on the LO HVP contributions in adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions to the ones in Ref.[1]. Then, we obtain: $a_\tau\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3516\pm 25)\times 10^{-11} $ and $\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2770.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-5}$ for 5 flavours.</description>
