      <title>GRHayL: a modern, infrastructure-agnostic, extensible library for GRMHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting multi-messenger signals from neutron stars and black holes requires reliable general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations across rapidly evolving high-performance-computing platforms, yet key algorithms are routinely rewritten within infrastructure-specific numerical-relativity codes, hindering verification and reuse. We present the General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Library (GRHayL), a modular, infrastructure-agnostic GR(M)HD library providing conservative-to-primitive recovery, reconstruction, flux/source and induction operators, equations of state, and neutrino leakage through an intuitive interface. GRHayL refactors and extends the mature IllinoisGRMHD code into reusable pointwise and stencil-wise kernels, enabling rapid development and cross-code validation in diverse frameworks, while easing adoption of new microphysics and future accelerators. We implement the same kernels in the Einstein Toolkit (Carpet and CarpetX) and BlackHoles@Home, demonstrating portability with minimal duplication. Validation combines continuous-integration unit tests with cross-infrastructure comparisons of analytic GRMHD Riemann problems, dynamical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff evolutions, and binary neutron-star mergers, showing comparable or improved behavior over legacy IllinoisGRMHD and established Einstein Toolkit codes.</description>

      <title>Particle Production by Time-Varying Dark Energy and the End of Cosmic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider various possible consequences of time-varying dark energy due to a quintessence scalar field whose energy density is partially converted to particles as the field evolves down its potential. This particle production acts as a source of thermal friction on the field that can make it difficult to distinguish whether dark energy is due to a radiating field rolling down a steep potential, a purely self-interacting field moving down a flatter potential, or a cosmological constant. By reducing the acceleration of the scalar field, thermal friction increases the amount of accelerated expansion and can cause a sizable bump in the quintessence equation of state. We take special interest in the case where a steep potential rapidly changes from positive to negative as the field evolves, resulting in the end of cosmic expansion and the beginning of contraction. Even in this case, we find that thermal friction lengthens the period of accelerated expansion and consequently delays the end of cosmic expansion, making it challenging to detect the impending transition to contraction using conventional cosmological tests. However, particle production can also provide alternative avenues for detection by generating a background of thermal dark radiation, partly comprised of neutrinos or other particles, whose energy density exceeds the remnant photon energy density.</description>

      <title>Modeling the frequency-domain ringdown amplitude of comparable-mass mergers with greybody factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that, in a binary coalescence, the greybody factor of the remnant black hole modulates the post-merger ringdown signal. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple four-parameter model based on the greybody factor accurately reproduces the frequency-domain amplitude of a large set of comparable-mass, aligned-spin numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, achieving mismatches of order ${\cal O}(10^{-5})$ and improving existing models by roughly two orders of magnitude. We also identify the optimal initial frequency for applying the model in the frequency domain and provide analytical fits of the model parameters in terms of the progenitor masses and aligned spins. Our results pave the way for new consistency tests of the ringdown phase, complementary to traditional black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Excitation of scalar quasi-normal modes from boson clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive scalar fields on black hole backgrounds generally admit two families of modes: quasi-bound states (QBS) and quasinormal modes (QNM). We demonstrate the orthogonality between the two mode families with respect to a relativistic product. We also find that, although the two families appear on different Riemann sheets of the Green's function of massive scalar perturbations, they can be brought to a single sheet with an appropriate redefinition of the frequency variable. In this variable, it is more natural to see how both mode families can be excited by initial data, and to approximate the Green's function with saddle points. Finally, we investigate the QNM emission from boson clouds - the latter effectively consisting of a single QBS - driven by the tidal perturbation of a second compact object. We show that while the resonant emission of QNMs is generally suppressed, QNM transitions may be more prominent when the interaction with the perturber is non-resonant, such as in the dynamical capture of unbound objects, and when the perturber transits close to the light ring.</description>

      <title>Effective metric for binaries in framework of EOB theory to fifth PM order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To establish a self-consistent effective one-body (EOB) theory that describes the dynamical evolution of binary systems based on the post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation, where the Hamiltonian, radiation reaction force, and waveforms are derived from an effective metric, the primary objective is to obtain the effective metric. Given that third generation gravitational wave detectors require at least fifth-order PM accuracy, in this paper we constructed an effective metric in the EOB theory of binaries up to fifth PM order. The effective metric is of type D, allowing for the derivation of decoupled and variable-separable equations for the null tetrad component of the gravitational perturbed Weyl tensor. This presents a basis for us to establish a self-consistent EOB theory up to 5PM order.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Anisotropic Gravitational Collapse in Painlev\'e-Gullstrand Coordinates: A Geometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed geometric analysis of adiabatic, anisotropic gravitational collapse formulated in a single Painlev\'e-Gullstrand coordinate system that covers both the interior and exterior, thereby eliminating cross-chart matching artifacts. Building on the Oppenheimer-Snyder framework with a phenomenologically motivated energy-density profile, we enforce the Israel junction conditions and obtain closed-form surface evolution. Within this unified chart we derive exact solutions for the complete collapse process, characterize the causal structure, and track horizon formation and evolution. In particular, we identify and analyse a double apparent-horizon phase inside the matter and show that the event horizon stabilizes at the Schwarzschild radius. We further obtain critical parameter relations that govern the dynamics, including a threshold linking initial compactness to immediate horizon formation. The model is geometrically self-consistent within Einstein's equations but exhibits violations of the standard point-wise energy conditions, highlighting known limitations of idealized anisotropic matter models and delineating the boundary where classical descriptions become inadequate. Together, these results provide geometric insights, compact analytic benchmarks and a didactic, coordinate-uniform perspective on collapse and horizon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Effects of Sources Inspired by ideal Electromagnetic Fields in Spherical Painlev\'e-Gullstrand Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyze a class of static spherically symmetric spacetimes in general relativity sourced exclusively by classical electrostatic configurations. Using a spherically symmetric Painlev\'e-Gullstrand-like metric with unit lapse and a radial shift function, we develop piecewise-defined solutions where the interior geometry is flat and the exterior is supported by several sources inspired by electromagnetic distributions. These include point-charge-like fields, Yukawa-screened electric fields, dielectric layers, and Hulth\'en-type field. The Einstein equations naturally impose a relation between the energy density and radial pressure, while the tangential pressure is derived from the metric. We systematically evaluate the classical energy conditions in each model and study the appearance of singular behavior using Israel junction conditions. This framework offers an analytically tractable setting to explore the gravitational effects of physically simple, well-understood sources without resorting to exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Unified dynamical system formulations for $f(R,\phi,X)$ gravity with applications to nonminimal derivative coupling and $R^2$-Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two different dynamical system formulations are presented for the generic $f(R,\phi,X)$ family of gravity theories. As illustrative examples, the first and the second formulation is applied to study the phase space of a toy model of the Non-Minimal Derivative Coupling (NMDC) without a potential, and the mixed $R^2$-Higgs inflation model, respectively. The first dynamical system formulation applied to the toy NMDC model, although able to identify several invariant submanifolds, fails to fully investigate the fixed point structure, as all the fixed points turn out to be non-hyperbolic. We, however, discover an interesting feature that the qualitative dynamics are independent of the coupling strength between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field derivative. The second dynamical system formulation applied to the mixed $R^2$-Higgs inflation model performs much better, being able to correctly reduce to the individual phase spaces of the $R^2$ and Higgs inflation separately in special cases, as well as correctly delivering the expected invariant submanifolds and fixed points. For the mixed $R^2$-Higgs case, illustrative phase portraits are provided for a somewhat better understanding of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Back-action from inertial and non-inertial Unruh-DeWitt detectors revisited in covariant perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the back-action from a spatially pointlike particle detector on a quantum scalar field, as characterised by the expectation value of the field's stress-energy tensor, without conditioning on a measurement of the detector. First, assuming the field to be initially in a zero-mean Gaussian Hadamard state in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, we evaluate the field's two-point function in second-order perturbation theory by techniques of covariant curved spacetime quantum field theory, which allow a full control of the time and space localisation of the interaction, and do not rely on field mode decompositions or non-local particle countings. The detector's two-point function splits into a deterministic and a fluctuating part, and we show that this split is maintained in the back-action.
  We then specialise to a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in an energy eigenstate, for which the back-action is fully fluctuating. We compute the renormalised stress-energy tensor for a massless scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for a general detector trajectory, using the manifestly causal two-point function. We present explicit analytic and numerical results for an inertial detector and a uniformly linearly accelerated detector, switched on in the asymptotic past. The energy flux into and out of the accelerated detector accounts exactly for the energy gained and lost by the detector in its transitions due to the Unruh effect. The same holds for the outward flux associated with de-excitations of the inertial detector, which has a vanishing excitation rate and no inward flux. A novelty with the accelerated detector is two regions of negative energy density when the detector is initially prepared in its ground state, one near the Rindler horizon that bounds the causal future of the trajectory, the other in the far future of the trajectory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave interactions with a viscous fluid: Core collapse supernova, binary neutron star merger, and accretion around a black hole merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is normally treated as being insignificant. However, recent work has shown that the interaction with a viscous fluid may be astrophysically important when the distance between the matter and GW source is somewhat smaller than the GW wavelength. Previous work has mainly considered perturbations on a Minkowski background, and here these results are extended to the case that the background is a general, non-vacuum, static, spherically symmetric spacetime. Expressions are obtained for GW damping and the consequent heating of the fluid, and implemented in computer code. The results are applied to astrophysical scenarios: Core collapse supernovae, the post-merger signal from a binary neutron star merger, and matter accreting at a binary black hole merger. It is found that, compared to the Minkowski case, the damping and heating effects increase, in some cases by several orders of magnitude. It is possible for a GW signal to be completely damped, and for the heating to be such that a gamma-ray burst occurs.</description>

      <title>Phantom Menace in general Palatini $f(R,\phi)$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study general $f(R,\phi)$ theories in Palatini formalism and attempt to constrain the behavior of ones that could support both inflationary and late-time expansion era in a unified model. In particular, we find conditions for which the theories remain consistent in weak gravity regimes as well as cosmic expansion eras in both early and late universe. Assuming that the curvature part of the $f(R,\phi)$ behaves as Starobinsky gravity, we assess post-inflation dynamical stability of the theory in Einstein frame and proceed to isolate two distinct fixed points that provide a stable late-time accelerating universe. Comparison with DESI, Cosmic Chronometers, and SNeIa datasets adds more stringent constraints to the behavior of the theory near the present epoch, giving us one stable fixed point where expansion is driven by a phantom scalar field. However, time scales of the two fixed points suggest that this fixed point may be transient and may eventually evolve toward a stable expansion stage driven potential domination in the distant future of the universe.</description>

      <title>First-time assessment of glitch-induced bias and uncertainty in inference of extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of streams of transient, non-Gaussian noise artifacts or "glitches" on the parameter estimation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Glitches cause biased and less precise inference for short-duration signals such as massive black hole binaries, but their effect on long-lived sources such as EMRIs has not been quantified. Using simulated LISA observations containing injected EMRIs and streams of shapelet-based glitches drawn from the LISA Pathfinder catalog, we estimate the glitch-induced parameter biases and uncertainties through a Fisher-matrix-based analysis whose accuracy we verify with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo. We find that moderately mitigated glitch streams i.e. ones containing only glitches of up to moderate SNRs ($\rho \lesssim 90$) induce negligible to minor biases $[\sim0.04\sigma ,\sim0.6\sigma]$ in the inferred EMRI parameters. In contrast, weakly mitigated glitch streams containing higher-SNR events ($\rho \lesssim 400$) can produce biases nearing $1\sigma$. These results demonstrate that, when compared to inference of other sources such as massive black hole binaries, EMRI inference is notably more robust to glitches. We stress that at least some amount of glitch modeling and mitigation remains essential for unbiased EMRI analyses in the LISA era.</description>

      <title>Modified light-cylinder and centrifugal acceleration in Schwarzschild geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the motion of an electron constrained to follow a magnetic field line near a primordial sub-stellar mass black hole. Earlier studies treated the problem in flat (Minkowski) spacetime, yielding qualitatively correct results and introducing a light cylinder (LC), a hypothetical surface where the linear velocity of rotation equals the speed of light. However, this picture changes significantly when gravity is included. By analyzing the electron's dynamics in the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain a modified light cylinder (MLC) whose geometry no longer resembles a cylinder. We then determine the maximum energies attainable by the electrons under the limiting effects of inverse Compton scattering, curvature radiation, and synchrotron radiation.</description>

      <title>GWTC-4.0: Searches for Gravitational-Wave Lensing Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive objects along their path. Depending on the lens mass and the lens-source geometry, this can lead to the observation of a single distorted signal or multiple repeated events with the same frequency evolution. We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectrum and black hole total transmission mode (in)stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total transmission modes (TTMs) are modes with complex frequencies that propagate across a black hole spacetime without reflection. Recently, it is found that suitably tailored time-dependent scattering can excite these complex modes and suppress the reflected signal for the entire duration of the process, a phenomenon referred to as virtual absorption. Motivated by this, we present the study of the spectrum stability of TTMs using pseudospectrum and condition numbers. We focus on perturbations of $d$-dimensional Tangherlini black holes and recast the TTM problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem by utilizing the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. The results show that TTMs are generically spectrally unstable, with sensitivity increasing for higher overtones, in close analogy with quasinormal modes. A notable exception is a purely imaginary TTM whose pseudospectrum's contours are nearly concentric and whose condition number is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the overtones, indicating enhanced spectral stability. Additionally, we confirm that purely imaginary TTMs occur only for spin $s=2$, whereas genuinely complex TTM families appear only in sufficiently high dimensions, $d \geqslant 8$, extending earlier claims that placed the onset at $d \geqslant 10$.</description>

      <title>Implementing F (T ) Gravity in Boltzmann Codes: A Framework for Power Spectrum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the nonlinearity of the power-law model of F(T) gravity, highlighting the inability of the Boltzmann solver CLASS to handle nonlinear models. As a workaround, a second-order Taylor expansion is applied to the nonlinear field equations, under the assumption that the extra degree of freedom n, which quantifies deviations from the currently favored cosmological model (\Lambda CDM), remains sufficiently small to preserve the key properties of the \Lambda CDM model. The validity of the Taylor expansion is supported by supernova data indicating n \leq 0.05, for which the power spectrum can be accurately computed within CLASS with a negligible truncation error.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with non-linear barotropic Israel-Stewart fluid with causal relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an extended expression for the relaxation time of a barotropic Israel-Stewart (IS) fluid using the non-linear causality constraint, and propose a new formulation for modeling causal viscous dissipation in barotropic fluids. With this generalized relaxation time, the non-linear IS equation simplifies to a first-order non-linear expression connecting bulk viscous pressure and energy density, which remains valid in any homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. In the case of spatially flat Friedmann universe, adopting this extended relation in the generalized non-linear IS theory, provides new class of analytical solutions in both, the linear, and the non-linear regimes. We also find that, the resulting effective equation of state in the linear regime naturally reproduces the generalized polytropic form which is often introduced phenomenologically in literature. Resulting dynamical implications are investigated and the constraints necessary for ensuring an acceptable evolutionary behavior for the fluid are determined. A detailed dynamical system analysis of the coupled Einstein-Israel-Stewart (EIS) system is also performed. Finally, we solve the coupled EIS equations numerically, and show that the model can support a transient Hubble slow-roll expansion phase with a smooth exit to a radiation-dominated universe, which is challenging to obtain in standard inflationary models.</description>

      <title>A Universal Geometric Framework for Black Hole Phase Transitions: From Multivaluedness to Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed synchronized multivalued behavior in thermodynamic, dynamical, and geometric quantities during the black hole first-order phase transition, which enables a diagnosis from different perspectives, yet its fundamental origin has remained poorly understood. By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for diagnosing phase transitions via multivaluedness and establishes a unified geometric perspective on black hole thermodynamics, chaotic dynamics, and spacetime structure during first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Field Quantisations in Schwarzschild Spacetime: Theory versus Low-Energy Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum particles in the Earth's gravitational field are successfully described by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with Newton's gravitational potential. Particularly, quantum mechanics is in agreement with such experiments as free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity. However, quantum mechanics is a low-energy approximation to quantum field theory. The latter is successful by the description of high-energy experiments. Gravity is embedded in quantum field theory through the general-covariance principle. This framework is known in the literature as quantum field theory in curved spacetime, where the concept of a quantum particle is, though, ambiguous. In this article, we study in this framework how a Hawking particle moves in the far-horizon region of Schwarzschild spacetime by computing its propagator. We find this propagator differs from that which follows from the path-integral formalism -- the formalism which adequately describes both free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for inflationary model building in the framework of metric-affine gravity. Such a mechanism involves an inflaton non-minimally coupled with the Holst invariant. If the non-minimal coupling function has a zero point and it is very steep at that same point, then the canonically normalized inflaton potential always features an exponential plateau, regardless of the shape of the original inflaton potential. The inflationary predictions in such a region are equivalent to the ones of Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <title>Sound as a gauge theory and its infrared triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, there has been a considerable interest on the infrared behavior of various field theories. In particular, the connections between memory effects, asymptotic symmetries, and soft theorems (the ``infrared triangle'') have been explored in much depth within the context of high-energy physics. In this paper, we show how sound also admits an infrared triangle. We consider the linear perturbations of the Euler equations for a barotropic and irrotational fluid and show how low-frequency changes in an acoustic source can lead to lasting displacements of fluid particles. We proceed to write these linear perturbations in terms of a two-form potential -- a Kalb--Ramond field, in the high-energy physics terminology. This phrases linear sound as a gauge theory and thus allows the use of standard techniques to probe the infrared structure of acoustics. We show how the memory effect relates to asymptotic symmetries in this dual formulation, and comment on how these notions can be connected to soft theorems. This exhibits the first example of an infrared triangle in a condensed matter system and provides new pathways to the experimental detection of memory effects.</description>

      <title>Charged black holes in the 1/N expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study some implications of $SU(N)\times U(1)$ theories coupled to gravity in the large-$N$ limit. We find that in theories with quarks transforming as $q\sim (\mathbf{N},1)$, black holes (BH) with charge larger than a critical value approach extremality $(M_{\rm BH}=\sqrt{2} M_{\rm Pl} Q_{\rm BH})$ as they evaporate. This occurs because BHs in this theory can only lose charge by emitting baryons, a process suppressed by a combinatoric factor $e^{-N\log N}$. Once extremality is reached the BH evolution halts for exponentially long times, $\tau_{\rm BH}\gtrsim e^{N\log N}$, without being protected by any symmetry. At times $t\gg\tau_{\rm BH}$ the BH forms a cloud of deconfined quarks around it, a \textit{quark corona}. The quarks are connected to the horizon by strings extending throughout distances that can be much larger than the inverse of the confinement scale, $\Lambda_N^{-1}$. Strikingly, due to energy conservation, these long strings cannot break even for light quarks. These effects can be further enhanced in clockwork-like theories based on Yang-Mills sectors of the type, $SU(N_1)\times SU(N_2)\times ...\times U(1)$. As an application to phenomenology, we give examples where BHs as light as one gram survive until today without evaporating, opening up regions of parameter space for primordial BH dark matter previously excluded by Hawking evaporation. This result relies only on large-$N$ combinatorics and is independent of the radiation mechanism from the BH, particle masses, and confinement scale. The theories we discuss pass non-trivial tests imposed by Swampland conjectures, including completeness of the spectrum as well as the weak gravity conjecture.</description>

      <title>In-plane Black-hole Spin Measurements Suggest Most Gravitational-wave Mergers Form in Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit tilt angles $\theta_{1(2)}$ of merging stellar-mass black holes provide key insights into their astrophysical origin. The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaborations (2025a, arXiv:2508.18083) report that the spin-orbit tilt distribution of mergers in the latest Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 exhibits a global peak at near-perpendicular directions $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$. Here, we recover this feature using hierarchical Bayesian inference with parametric models that are tailored to enhance the diagnostic power about astrophysical formation channels. We find that the spin distribution of the low-mass bulk of the binary black hole merger population $(m_1\lesssim 44.3^{+8.7}_{-4.6}\,\rm M_\odot)$ can be well-modelled by a dominant Gaussian component that peaks at $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$, possibly mixed with a subdominant isotropic component. Models that include a component with spins preferentially aligned with the orbit are disfavoured by current data (with Bayes factors $|\Delta\ln\mathcal{B}|\approx1$ to $3$) and constrain its contribution to be small ($\xi\sim\mathcal{O}(1)\,\%$). If these findings are reinforced by more detections, they would challenge any major contribution from the traditional isolated-binary formation scenario yielding closely aligned spins. Instead, the dominant component with near-perpendicular spins qualitatively matches expectations from the evolution of isolated massive stellar triples in the galactic field, where the Lidov-Kozai effect naturally produces a unique overabundance of mergers with $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$.</description>

Abstract: Here we summarize discussions and conclusions from the conference ``The Era of Binary Supermassive Black Holes: Coordination of Nanohertz-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Follow-up,'' held at the Aspen Center for Physics from February 2-7, 2025. The meeting facilitated a crucial knowledge exchange between electromagnetic and gravitational-wave theorists, observers, and cyber-infrastructure experts. The central goal was to guide the development of multi-messenger follow-up strategies for binary supermassive black hole detections by pulsar timing arrays. To build a common basis of understanding for the broader scientific community, this summary outlines the main considerations and recommendations from the meeting, summarizes the knowledge gaps identified, and ends with a potential roadmap to catalyze discussion about the search for electromagnetic counterparts to massive black hole binaries detected by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Shockwaves and Time Delays in Einstein-Maxwell Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the shockwave metric in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell effective field theory (EFT) by performing an ultra-relativistic boost of the charged black hole solution accompanied by a rescaling of its mass and charge, including leading order EFT corrections. In contrast to the neutral (Schwarzschild) case, where higher derivative operators leave the shockwave geometry unchanged, we show that electrically charged shockwaves receive nontrivial EFT corrections. We then compute the time delay experienced by a probe photon traversing the resulting charged shockwave. We find that two EFT contributions, the correction to the shockwave geometry and the backreaction induced by the probe photon, are both essential for obtaining a physical time delay that is invariant under field redefinitions of the metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory, conceived as a tractable and precise toy-model quantum cosmology in two dimensions. Disk path integrals with the insertion of matter field operators, taken along a judiciously chosen complex contour, yield states akin to the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction. Working in the fixed $K$-representation, where $K$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature, we compute the one-loop wavefunctions and put forward a conjecture for the all-loop expressions. A suitable pairing of Liouville disk path integrals yields a $K$-independent quantity that may form the basis for a well-defined inner product on the space of Euclidean histories. We also consider other ensembles, including one with fixed area, and provide a static patch perspective with a timelike feature.</description>

      <title>Testing Gravity with Binary Pulsars in the SKA Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary (and trinary) radio pulsars are natural laboratories in space for understanding gravity in the strong field regime, with many unique and precise tests carried out so far, including the most precise tests of the strong equivalence principle and of the radiative properties of gravity. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, with its high sensitivity in the Southern Hemisphere, will vastly improve the timing precision of recycled pulsars, allowing for a deeper search of potential deviations from general relativity (GR) in currently known systems. A Galactic census of pulsars will, in addition, will yield the discovery of dozens of relativistic pulsar systems, including potentially pulsar -- black hole binaries, which can be used to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis and the ``no-hair'' theorem. Aspects of gravitation to be explored include tests of strong equivalence principles, gravitational dipole radiation, extra field components of gravitation, gravitomagnetism, and spacetime symmetries. In this chapter, we describe the kinds of gravity tests possible with binary pulsar and outline the features and abilities that SKA must possess to best contribute to this science.</description>

      <title>Probing neutron star interiors and the properties of cold ultra-dense matter with the SKAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter inside neutron stars is compressed to densities several times greater than nuclear saturation density, while maintaining low temperatures and large asymmetries between neutrons and protons. Neutron stars, therefore, provide a unique laboratory for testing physics in environments that cannot be recreated on Earth. To uncover the highly uncertain nature of cold, ultra-dense matter, discovering and monitoring pulsars is essential, and the SKA will play a crucial role in this endeavour. In this paper, we will present the current state-of-the-art in dense matter physics and dense matter superfluidity, and discuss recent advances in measuring global neutron star properties (masses, moments of inertia, and maximum rotation frequencies) as well as non-global observables (pulsar glitches and free precession). We will specifically highlight how radio observations of isolated neutron stars and those in binaries -- such as those performed with the SKA in the near future -- inform our understanding of ultra-dense physics and address in detail how SKAO's telescopes unprecedented sensitivity, large-scale survey and sub-arraying capabilities will enable novel dense matter constraints. We will also address the potential impact of dark matter and modified gravity models on these constraints and emphasise the role of synergies between the SKA and other facilities, specifically X-ray telescopes and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are ensembles of millisecond pulsars observed for years to decades. The primary goal of PTAs is to study gravitational-wave astronomy at nanohertz frequencies, with secondary goals of undertaking other fundamental tests of physics and astronomy. Recently, compelling evidence has emerged in established PTA experiments for the presence of a gravitational-wave background. To accelerate a confident detection of such a signal and then study gravitational-wave emitting sources, it is necessary to observe a larger number of millisecond pulsars to greater timing precision. The SKAO telescopes, which will be a factor of three to four greater in sensitivity compared to any other southern hemisphere facility, are poised to make such an impact. In this chapter, we motivate an SKAO pulsar timing array (SKAO PTA) experiment. We discuss the classes of gravitational waves present in PTA observations and how an SKAO PTA can detect and study them. We then describe the sources that can produce these signals. We discuss the astrophysical noise sources that must be mitigated to undertake the most sensitive searches. We then describe a realistic PTA experiment implemented with the SKA and place it in context alongside other PTA experiments likely ongoing in the 2030s. We describe the techniques necessary to search for gravitational waves in the SKAO PTA and motivate how very long baseline interferometry can improve the sensitivity of an SKAO PTA. The SKAO PTA will provide a view of the Universe complementary to those of the other large facilities of the 2030s.</description>

      <title>Expanding Horizons - Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s Time-Domain Multi-Messenger Astronomy in the 2040s: EM Follow-up of LGWA Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coming decades will see gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy expand decisively into the mHz-Hz frequency range, opening access to a population of compact binaries that are currently invisible or only detectable moments before merger. The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) concept is designed to probe this gap, enabling continuous observation of compact binaries over months to years prior to coalescence, and detecting sources inaccessible to both space-based mHz detectors and current ground-based &gt;10 Hz facilities. This new GW window fundamentally alters the landscape of time-domain multi-messenger astronomy. Rather than reacting to mergers after the fact, LGWA enables predictive, scheduled electromagnetic (EM) follow-up, transforming how compact-object mergers, their environments, and their astrophysical channels are studied. However, fully exploiting LGWA discoveries requires EM capabilities that do not exist today and are unlikely to be available by the 2030s, particularly for wide-area, rapid, spectroscopically rich follow-up at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This White Paper identifies the key science cases enabled by LGWA that motivate new ground-based capabilities in the 2040s.</description>

      <title>Classification of the equation of state of neutron stars via sparse dictionary learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The post-merger phase of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers encodes valuable information about the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear matter. Extracting this information from the analysis of the post-merger waveforms remains challenging due to the high-frequency limitations of current detectors. Future third-generation observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and NEMO, will have the sensitivity required to resolve post-merger signals with high fidelity. In this work, we apply CLAWDIA, our recently developed sparse dictionary learning (SDL) framework, to classify different EOS models using only the post-merger gravitational-wave emission of simulated BNS mergers available in the CoRe database. Our dataset comprises five EOS models representative of a broad range of neutron star properties. The SDL framework is optimised under realistic detection conditions by injecting signals into simulated noise matching the sensitivity curves of ET and NEMO. Our results show that classification is primarily driven by the dominant post-merger frequency, $f_2$, which encodes EOS-dependent information. At a modest signal-to-noise ratio of 5, our method achieves $F_1$ scores of $0.76$ for ET and $0.70$ for NEMO, with performance improving for higher signal-to-noise ratios. The reliability and generalisation capabilities of the model are assessed with additional tests, including the classification of an EOS not included in the training dataset and the analysis of detector-specific biases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiclassical black hole emission in four spacetime dimensions is studied using a non-local effective action. The field equations that determine the time-dependent renormalized stress tensor are solved numerically for a black hole formed by an ingoing null shock wave, and otherwise smooth initial data. We find that Hawking radiation is generated dynamically near the black hole horizon and freely propagates out to null infinity, resulting in an outgoing energy flux that builds up from zero at early retarded times before the black hole forms. This resolves the long-standing issue of pre-Hawking radiation, suffered by calculations based on a static approximation to the stress tensor in an Unruh state, and paves the way towards four-dimensional black hole evolution with semiclassical back-reaction included.</description>

      <title>Decoupling perturbations from background in $f(Q)$ gravity: the square-root correction and the alleviation of the $\sigma_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a perturbation-level modification of symmetric teleparallel gravity of the form $f(Q)=F(Q)+M\sqrt{Q}$ and assess its ability to ease the $\sigma_8$ tension. The square-root term leaves the background expansion unchanged while modifying the effective gravitational coupling, providing a pure decoupling between background cosmology and structure-growth evolution. Using the latest redshift-space distortion data, including DESI DR2 Full-Shape measurements, we constrain $M$ and $\sigma_8$ across three representative backgrounds: $\Lambda$CDM, an $H_0$-tension-reducing model, and a DESI-motivated dynamical dark energy scenario. In all cases, the square-root correction suppresses growth and can reconcile $\sigma_8$ with Planck at the $1\sigma$ level, with the strongest improvement occurring in the $H_0$-tension-oriented background. A residual degeneracy between $M$ and $\sigma_8$ remains, indicating that future multi-probe analyses combining lensing and full-shape clustering will be required to determine whether the $\sqrt{Q}$ term represents a genuine signal of modified gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel equivalences in random matrix and tensor models between complex and self-adjoint theories with nontrivial quadratic terms in the action, established through an intermediate field representation. More precisely, we show that the partition functions of certain self-adjoint models and their complex counterparts are different integral representations of the exact same function. A special case of these equivalences takes a form of newly found dually weighted intermediate field representations, which generalize the standard intermediate field representation. We also find indications of an equivalence between real tensor models and self-transpose tensor models.</description>

      <title>An effective $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$-Szekeres modelling of the local Universe with Cosmicflows-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective description of the local cosmic environment, namely, for redshift $z \lesssim 0.1$, to quantify the bias induced by local structure on cosmological observables. Our approach models the metric of the nearby Universe as a superposition of multi-structured $\Lambda$-Szekeres patches, calibrated against the HAMLET peculiar velocity and density field reconstructions of Cosmicflows-4. From this framework we compute the fully inhomogeneous and anisotropic quasilocal expansion field predicted by our model, and use it to assess the impact of local structure on estimates of $H_0$. For this purpose we analyse low-redshift Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ catalogue. We find that accounting for the local structure increases the Hubble tension, yielding a shift in the best-fit value of the Hubble constant of order $\Delta H_0 \approx 0.5\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly and anomaly-induced action are evaluated for the two-dimensional $2D$ vector theory with classical conformal symmetry. Implementing local conformal symmetry while preserving the gauge invariance requires either giving up locality of the classical action or, equivalently, introducing an auxiliary scalar field. The two-dimensional limit in such a theory is singular. However, in the dimensional regularization, the limit $D \to 2$ in the one-loop divergence is smooth. As a result, we arrive at the expression for anomaly, which has a rich general structure, typical for the dimensions $D \geq 4$. For comparison and completeness, we also evaluate anomalies for conformal scalar and fermions, also in the presence of auxiliary external scalars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that quantum field theories in curved spacetime suffer from a number of pathologies, including the inability to relate states on different spatial slices by proper unitary time-evolution operators. In this article, we illustrate this issue by describing the canonical quantisation of a free scalar field in de Sitter space and explicitly demonstrating that the vacuum at a given time slice is unitarily inequivalent to that at any other time. In particular, we find that, if both background and Hamiltonian dynamics are taken into account, this inequivalence holds even for infinitesimally small time steps and not only in the asymptotic time limits.</description>

      <title>A finite temperature framework for quark matter with color-superconducting phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current observations of neutron stars and measurements of gravitational waves only provide constraints on the zero temperature ($T=0$) equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. The detection of the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from a binary neutron star merger would additionally provide access to finite-temperature properties of the EoS which contain more information about the composition and the interactions of dense matter than the cold EoS alone. In particular deconfined quark matter may be probed by its characteristic finite temperature effects. This is especially the case for color-superconducting phases, in which the quasiparticle contribution to the thermal pressure is exponentially suppressed at low temperatures. Here we develop a new finite $T$ framework to model the thermal EoS for dense quark matter based on the cold quark matter EoS which is useful for numerical relativity simulations. We test the validity of the framework against a three-flavor NJL mean-field calculation, both with and without diquark pairing. We find that even for the complicated phase diagram of the NJL model including multiple different phases the framework is accurate to the few percent level for temperatures up to $T\sim 50\,$MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study shows that the more a dark energy model allows the equation of state to become phantom-like toward the past, the better it fits current observations which also may lead to stronger statistical tension with $\Lambda$CDM. In particular, models with greater flexibility in their redshift evolution, such as power-law type forms, are mildly preferred over more restrictive parametrizations with similar parameter dimensionality. For the dataset including DESY5, the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM reaches a significance of $6.26\sigma$. These results indicate that present data are sensitive to enhanced phantom behaviour and provide clear guidance for constructing phenomenologically viable dark energy parametrizations.</description>

      <title>The Stretched Horizon Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, in the presence of a boundary, $\Gamma$, of finite spatial size. The boundary is located near a cosmological event horizon, and is subject to boundary conditions that fix the conformal class of the induced metric, and, $K$, the trace of the extrinsic curvature along $\Gamma$. The proximity of $\Gamma$ to the horizon is controlled by the dimensionless parameter ${K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$. We provide an exhaustive analysis of linearised gravitational perturbations for the setup. This is performed both for a $\Gamma$ encasing a portion of the static patch that ends just before the cosmological horizon (pole patch), as well as a $\Gamma$ containing only the region near the cosmological horizon (cosmic patch). In the pole patch, we uncover a layered hierarchy of modes: ordinary normal modes, a novel type of boundary gapless mode, and boundary soft modes of frequency $\omega \approx \pm 2\pi i T_{\text{dS}}$, with $T_{\text{dS}}$ the horizon temperature. Minkowskian behaviour is recovered only for angular momenta $l \gtrsim {K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ which can be made parametrically large, thus attenuating previously found growing modes. In the cosmic patch, we uncover sound and shear fluid-dynamical modes that we interpret in terms of a conformal fluid with shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\tfrac{\eta}{s} = \tfrac{1}{4\pi}$ and vanishing bulk viscosity $\zeta=0$. The fluid dynamical sector is shown to admit a non-linear treatment. We describe a scaling regime in which the stretched horizon gravitational dynamics is dictated by a universal Rindler geometry, independent to the details of the infilling horizon. We briefly discuss quantitative features that distinguish cosmological and black hole horizons away from the Rindler regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For axions present during inflation, it has been shown that a non-minimal coupling $\xi_\sigma$ of the inflaton to gravity worsens isocurvature bounds, while a non-minimal coupling $\xi_\rho$ of the radial Peccei-Quinn field can alleviate them. We analyze the simultaneous presence of both couplings and determine when one effect dominates the other, in both the metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. The two tendencies interpolate smoothly, but introducing a non-minimal inflaton coupling reduces the viable interval of $\xi_\rho$ in which isocurvature bounds can be alleviated while avoiding backreaction on the inflationary dynamics. We illustrate our findings in Palatini Higgs inflation and Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau's two-fluid model of superfluidity ceases to apply in regions where the condensate amplitude exhibits rapid spatial variation, such as vortex cores or in the vicinity of container walls. A recently proposed relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii-type framework treats the condensate as an independent scalar degree of freedom, enabling a controlled analysis of such regimes. We use it to construct stationary superflows close to the superfluid-normal phase boundary, and examine their stability. We obtain an exact expression for Landau's critical velocity and show that the standard Newtonian profiles (such as the near-vortex condensate depletion or the boundary-layer decay) persist unmodified in the relativistic setting. We further analyse a genuinely relativistic configuration in which an accelerated superfluid develops a phase boundary induced by Tolman temperature gradients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that atomic clock measurements provides an exceptionally sensitive Solar System probe of scalar tensor dark energy. By connecting variations in Newton's constant and differential clock drifts to the dynamics of a single dark energy scalar, we derive a direct constraint on the present day equation of state and our results force any locally coupled scalar dark energy into a very slowly rolling regime, giving the strongest bounds on the equation of state parameter. This is independent of potential shape or kinetic structure and rules out broad classes of canonical and non canonical models, leaving only near Lambda CDM behavior or fully decoupled fields as viable late time scalar dark energy, thereby leaving cosmological constant and minimally coupled scalar field models as the most consistent dark energy regimes. We also use results from Lunar Laser Ranging and photon trajectories to further strengthen our the depth of our constraints.</description>

      <title>Delayed Scaling of Multi-Type Cosmic F- and D-strings in VOS Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model to the case of one cosmic F-string and two D-strings as color flux tubes in pure Spin($4N$) gauge theory. We analytically calculate the scaling string density as a function of the reconnection probabilities, and confirm our results with numerical calculations. We also determine the timescale at which the string density reaches the scaling regime, and find that for certain values of the reconnection probability, the scaling time can become extremely large, by many orders of magnitude. This leads to a characteristic suppression signature of the gravitational-wave signal at high frequencies, which may become observable in the frequency range of future interferometric gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Fighting non-locality with non-locality: microcausality and boundary conditions in QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories, globally charged observables necessarily depend non-locally on the kinematical fields, with this dependence extending to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime. Despite this, we show that a subset of such observables can be consistently regarded as local to the bulk, in a manner that respects microcausality and leaves locality properties of uncharged observables untouched. A sufficient condition for this is to impose kinematically non-local boundary conditions on the large gauge sector of the theory, and to invoke a relational notion of localisation for observables. This reveals a relatively underappreciated link between boundary conditions, and different notions of microcausality and locality. We develop this point through a detailed case study in scalar QED, describing non-local boundary conditions that allow a large family of observables on a codimension-1 bulk surface to be viewed as local to that surface, despite being dressed by asymptotic Wilson lines. We show that this property continues to hold within a perturbative quantisation of the theory, and we argue that this leads to a consistent local net of algebras that includes these charged observables in bulk algebras. We explain how this setup may be understood in terms of a preferred dynamical reference frame for small gauge transformations appearing in the boundary conditions. Many features of the theory (such as microcausality, the vacuum state, and the net of algebras of observables) depend on the choice of this frame, and we briefly discuss some repercussions of this for algebraic formulations of QFT. While our analysis is performed in QED, we expect our results to carry over qualitatively to more complicated theories including gravity.</description>

Abstract: The Hamiltonian analysis for a 3-dimensional connection dynamics of $\frak{so}(1,2)$, spanned by $\{L_{-+},L_{-2},L_{+2}\}$ instead of $\{L_{01}, L_{02}, L_{12}\}$, is first conducted in a Bondi-like coordinate system.The symmetry of the system is clearly presented. A null coframe with 3 independent variables and 9 connection coefficients are treated as basic configuration variables. All constraints and their consistency conditions, the solutions of Lagrange multipliers as well as the equations of motion are presented. There is no physical degree of freedom in the system. The Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) spacetime is discussed as an example to check the analysis. Unlike the ADM formalism, where only non-degenerate geometries on slices are dealt with and the Ashtekar formalism, where non-degenerate geometries on slices are mainly concerned though the degenerate geometries may be studied as well, in the present formalism the geometries on the slices are always degenerate though the geometries for the spacetime are not degenerate.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Analysis of 4-dimensional Spacetime in Bondi-like Coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:1804.10746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the Hamiltonian formulation of gravity in 4-dimensional spacetime under Bondi-like coordinates ${v, r, x^a, a=2, 3}$. In Bondi-like coordinates, the 3-dimensional hypersurface is a null hypersurface and the evolution direction is the advanced time $v$. The internal symmetry group $SO(1,3)$ of the 4-dimensional spacetime is decomposed into $SO(1,1)$, $SO(2)$, and $T^\pm(2)$, whose Lie algebra $so(1,3)$ is decomposed into $so(1,1)$, $so(2)$, $t^\pm(2)$ correspondingly. The $SO(1,1)$ symmetry is very obvious in this kind of decomposition, which is very useful in $so(1,1)$ BF theory. General relativity can be reformulated as the 4-dimensional coframe $(e^I_\mu)$ and connection $({\omega}^{IJ}_\mu)$ dynamics of gravity based on this kind of decomposition in the Bondi-like coordinate system. The coframe consists of 2 null 1-forms $e^-$, $e^+$ and 2 spacelike 1-forms $e^2$, $e^3$. The Palatini action is used. The Hamiltonian analysis is conducted by the Dirac's methods. The consistency analysis of constraints has been done completely. There are 2 scalar constraints and one 2-dimensional vector constraint. The torsion-free conditions are acquired from the consistency conditions of the primary constraints about ${\pi}^\mu_{IJ}$. The consistency conditions of the primary constraints ${\pi}^0_{IJ}=0$ can be reformulated as Gauss constraints. The conditions of the Lagrange multipliers have been acquired. The Poisson brackets among the constraints have been calculated. There are 46 constraints including 6 first class constraints ${\pi}^0_{IJ}=0$ and 40 second class constraints. The local physical degrees of freedom is 2. The integrability conditions of Lagrange multipliers $n_0$, $l_0$, and $e^A_0$ are Ricci identities. The equations of motion of the canonical variables have also been shown.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the viability of the algebraic-hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein's constraint equations to construct initial data sets for inhomogeneous cosmological space-times with $\mathbb{T}^3$ topology. To do so, we implement a pseudo-spectral approach based on the discrete Fourier transform for numerically and explore the advantages and disadvantages of this method by comparing the numerical solutions with known analytical initial data sets. Additionally, we perform an stability analysis of the system to gain deeper understanding on the limitations of the proposed scheme. Finally, we numerically obtain new families of initial data sets through manipulation of the original system by imposing restrictions on some variables.</description>

Abstract: Four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes have been central to recent developments in infrared physics. Gravitational waves reaching the asymptotic boundary reveal an infinite-dimensional symmetry group known as the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group. The vacuum structure breaks this symmetry, giving rise to Goldstone modes that play a pivotal role in the analysis of scattering amplitudes. However, these modes must be added to the phase space of the metric formulation. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of general relativity, teleparallel gravity, which is dynamically equivalent to the standard metric description in the bulk. This framework relies on a tetrad field to encode the gravitational degrees of freedom and a flat connection to represent inertial effects. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose a novel encoding of the Goldstone modes within the flat connection. We examine the implications of this approach in the covariant phase space framework, focusing on the symplectic potential and its connection to the Wald-Zoupas prescription.</description>

Abstract: In this work, following our recent findings in [1], we extend our analysis to explore the generalization of spherically symmetric and static black-bounce solutions, known from General Relativity, within the framework of the $f(R)$ theory in the metric formalism. We develop a general approach to determine the sources for any model where $f(R) = R + H(R)$, provided that the corresponding source for the bounce metric in General Relativity is known. As a result, we demonstrate that black-bounce solutions can emerge from this theory when considering the coupling of $f(R)$ gravity with nonlinear electrodynamics and a partially phantom scalar field. We also analyzed the energy conditions of these solutions and found that, unlike in General Relativity, it is possible to satisfy all energy conditions in certain regions of space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of black holes (BHs) and their potential deviations from classical General Relativity (GR) remain central questions in modern astrophysics. Nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) offers a promising mechanism to construct regular BHs that avoid singularities while retaining key astrophysical features. In this work, we analyze NED-inspired BHs and derive constraints on the magnetic parameter using Bayesian parameter estimation from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. We obtain $q = 0.63 ^{+0.68}_{-0.44} \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$ for M87* and $q = 0.33 ^{+0.36}_{-0.23} \times 10^6 M_{\odot}$ for Sgr A*, affecting their horizon structure. A comparison with the Schwarzschild solution highlights deviations in geometry and horizon properties, emphasizing the impact of NED. We also examine observational signatures, including BH shadows and gravitational lensing. Using $R_{\text{sh}} = r_{\text{ph}} \sqrt{1/f(r_{\text{ph}})}$, we explore shadow features under uniform and non-uniform plasma conditions, revealing deviations from GR predictions due to NED effects. By analyzing photon sphere shifts and lensing patterns, we identify observable features that distinguish these BHs from classical ones. Our results suggest that NED-induced modifications may leave detectable imprints in strong-field regimes, opening pathways to test alternative gravity models. Future missions such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and next-generation X-ray observatories, along with ongoing observations from the EHT and gravitational wave detections by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo (LIGO--Virgo), will be essential for refining constraints on such models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct the first phenomenological waveform model which contains the "complete" $\ell=2$ spherical harmonic mode content for gravitational wave signals emitted by the coalescence of binary black holes with spin precession: The model contains the dominant part of the gravitational wave displacement memory, which manifests in the $(\ell=2, m=0)$ spherical harmonic in a co-precessing frame, as well as the oscillatory component of this mode. The model is constructed by twisting up the oscillatory contribution of the mode, as it was previously done for the rest of spherical harmonic modes in IMRPhenomTPHM and the Phenom family of waveform models. Regarding the displacement memory contribution present in the aligned spin (2,0) mode, we discuss a procedure to analytically compute the "precessing memory" in all the $\ell=2$ modes using the integration derived from the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs balance laws. The final waveform of the (2,0) mode is then obtained by summing together both contributions. We implement this as an extension of the computationally efficient IMRPhenomTPHM waveform model, and we test its accuracy by comparing against a set of Numerical Relativity simulations. Finally, we employ the model to perform a Bayesian parameter estimation injection analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new definition of temperature for the FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe, i.e. the effective temperature $T_{eff}:=dE/dS$, where $E$ is the energy and $S$ is the entropy of the FRW universe. Based on this definition, we get the effective temperature for the $N$-dimensional FRW universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Lovelock gravity. We find that for the 4-dimensional FRW universe, the effective temperature is always $T_{eff}=1/(4\pi R_A)$, which is exactly the same form with the Hawking temperature of the Schwarzschild black hole. In higher-dimensional FRW universe, the form of the effective temperature depends on the choices of the gravitational theories or the corresponding coupling constants. We also get the free energy of the FRW universe in the three theories of gravity.</description>

Abstract: This work considers positive energy theorems in asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes. Particular attention is given to spacetimes where conformal infinity has compact, Einstein cross-sections admitting Killing or parallel spinors; a positive energy theorem is derived for such spacetimes in terms of geometric data intrinsic to the cross-section. This is followed by the first complete proofs of the BPS inequalities in (the bosonic sectors of) 4D and 5D minimal, gauged supergravity, including with magnetic fields, provided the Maxwell field is exact. The BPS inequalities are proven for asymptotically AdS spacetimes, but also generalised to the aforementioned class of asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'', that also arise at the Newtonian and post-Newtonian levels, track the transition scale set by the halo parameters that control the strong-lensing upturn and can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider ``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a massless quantum scalar field in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds. Starting from its formal expression obtained within the covariant perturbative expansion to lowest order in the curvature, we evaluate the RSET in an arbitrary number of dimensions in terms of coordinate-space distributions. For time-dependent spherically symmetric spacetimes, we derive a multipole expansion and determine its asymptotic behavior. We find that the RSET is locally nonvanishing at null infinity and depends on the detailed dynamics of the collapsing body. However, the total emitted energy vanishes at this order, meaning that the leading contribution does not account for the energy density of the created particles. Nevertheless, by enforcing stress-tensor conservation up to second order in the curvature, we show that the total radiated energy can be extracted from the first-order RSET. Finally, we compute the induced quantum corrections to the metric at large distances, which display several interesting features.</description>

      <title>Wave Front Sensing demodulated at the difference frequency between two phase-modulation sidebands in a compound interferometer configuration for a gravitational-wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise alignment sensing and control are essential for maintaining the stability of laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, "Phase-Modulated-sideband $\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study \emph{brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces} in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes. Starting from the classical cycloidal brachistochrone in a constant gravitational field, we construct a Newtonian ``brachistochrone-ruled worldsheet'' whose rulings are time-minimizing trajectories between pairs of endpoints. We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces. Finally, we discuss basic geometric properties of such surfaces and identify natural Jacobi fields along the rulings.</description>

      <title>Equation of the Perfect Fluid in the FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the equation of state and its properties of the perfect fluid in the $D$-dimensional FRW universe under Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Lovelock gravity. In Einstein gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has no critical point in the $P$-$V$ diagram, but its isothermal lines have minima in the $4$-dimensional case and are always negative in higher dimensions. In Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has a critical point in the $5,6,7,8$-dimensional cases with phase transitions above the critical temperature. In Lovelock gravity, we get the equation of state and conditions of the critical points. Our work shows that both the theories of gravity and the dimensions of the FRW universe affect the existence of the critical point of the perfect fluid. Interestingly, if the critical point exists, phase transition always occures above the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Binary Black Hole Mergers: Spin and mass ratio effects on gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive parameter-space study of binary black hole (BBH) mergers using the SEOBNRv4\_opt waveform model. Our analysis spans $\sim 10^6$ simulated waveforms across a broad range of mass ratios \( q = \frac{m_1}{m_2} \in [1.0, 2.0] \) and aligned spin configurations. We investigate the influence of these parameters on remnant properties, including final spin ($\chi_f$), fractional mass loss ($M_{\mathrm{FL}}$), and peak gravitational-wave strain ($h_{\max}$). By systematically analyzing the trends across four distinct spin alignments (PP, PN, BP, BN), we identify non-monotonic behaviors and turning points in $M_{\mathrm{FL}}$ and $\chi_f$ as functions of $q$, highlighting subtle dynamical effects that are not explicitly emphasized in commonly used remnant fitting formulae. While confirming known correlations from numerical relativity, our results offer new insights into parameter interactions and waveform morphology, with implications for BBH population studies and remnant characterization. Across all configurations studied, the fractional mass loss due to gravitational-wave emission ranges between 2\% and 9.5\%, depending on the mass ratio and spin alignment. This work may also aid in understanding the spin and mass distributions of the more massive black holes formed post-merger, thereby contributing to future remnant-based astrophysical inference.</description>

      <title>No Dark Matter Axion During Minimal Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study minimal versions of Higgs inflation in the presence of a massless QCD axion. While the inflationary energy scale of the metric variant is too high to accommodate isocurvature bounds, it was argued that Palatini Higgs inflation could evade these constraints. We show, however, that an energy-dependent decay constant enhances isocurvature perturbations, implying that axions can at most constitute a tiny fraction $&lt; 10^{-5}$ of dark matter. This conclusion can be avoided in Einstein-Cartan gravity by an additional coupling of the axion to torsion, albeit for a very specific choice of parameters. Analogous constraints as well as the possibility to alleviate them are relevant for all inflationary models with a non-minimal coupling to gravity.</description>

      <title>Quadratic curvature corrections to 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics by background subtraction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We justify the applicability of the background subtraction method to both Einstein's gravity and its higher derivative corrections in 5-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, where the corresponding higher derivative corrections to the expression for the ADM mass and angular momentum are also worked out. Then we further apply the background subtraction method to calculate the first order corrected Gibbs free energy by the quadratic curvature terms for the 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole, which is in exact agreement with the previous result obtained by the holographic renormalization method. Such an agreement in turn substantiates the applicability of the background subtraction method.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics Relative to a Quantum Reference System: a Relative State Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an intrinsic or background-independent quantum framework based on entangled state rather than absolute quantum state, it describes a quantum relative state between the under-study quantum system and the quantum measuring apparatus as a quantum reference system, without relying on any external absolute parameter. The paper focuses on a simple example, in which a quantum object's one-dimensional position as an under-study quantum system, and a quantum clock as a quantum reference system or quantum measuring apparatus. The evolution equation of the state of the quantum object's position with respect to the state of the quantum clock is given coming from the Ricci-flat Kaehler-Einstein equation. In a linear and non-relativistic approximation, the framework recovers the equation of the standard quantum mechanics, in which an intrinsic potential related to some "inertial force" is automatically incorporated in the covariant derivative. A physical relative probability interpretation and a geometric non-trivial fiber bundle interpretation of the entangled state in this intrinsic quantum framework are given. Furthermore, some non-inertial effects, such as the "inertial force", coming from the general covariance of the intrinsic quantum framework are also discussed. Compared with the functional integral approach which is more easily to generalize the quantum clock to the quantum spacetime reference frame and study quantum gravity, the relative state approach as a canonical description is more suitable for conceptually demonstrating the connections to the standard formalism and interpretation of the quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Matching conditions at null infinity in the presence of logarithms: the role of advanced and retarded radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the general matching conditions between the future of past null infinity and the past of future null infinity, emphasizing the impact of dominant logarithmic terms in the asymptotic expansion of the fields near null infinity. We explicitly consider the cases of a massless scalar field and of electromagnetism. Key in our derivation is the identification of the physical origin of these logarithms, which are associated with advanced and retarded radiation saturating the finite energy flux condition at null infinity (in a space of functions which is made precise). The matching conditions arise then from the requirement of Coulombic (i.e., $1/r$) behaviour at spatial infinity.</description>

      <title>Structure of Chern-Simons Graviton Scattering Amplitudes from Topological Graviton Equivalence Theorem and Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a Topological Graviton Equivalence Theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces differential-geometric methods to study $n$-dimensional locally conformally flat spaces as submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$. We derive explicit formulas relating intrinsic and ambient differential-geometric objects, including curvature tensors, the codifferential and laplacian operators. We apply this approach to Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spaces using newfound embedding formulas, obtaining new and simplified expressions for the photon propagator in four dimensions.</description>
