      <title>Deep Learning-based Human Gesture Channel Modeling for Integrated Sensing and Communication Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless systems, contactless human recognition has emerged as one of the key application scenarios. Since human gesture motion induces subtle and random variations in wireless multipath propagation, how to accurately model human gesture channels has become a crucial issue for the design and validation of ISAC systems. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning-based human gesture channel modeling framework for ISAC scenarios, in which the human body is decomposed into multiple body parts, and the mapping between human gestures and their corresponding multipath characteristics is learned from real-world measurements. Specifically, a Poisson neural network is employed to predict the number of Multi-Path Components (MPCs) for each human body part, while Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (C-VAEs) are reused to generate the scattering points, which are further used to reconstruct continuous channel impulse responses and micro-Doppler signatures. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and generalization across different gestures and subjects, providing an interpretable approach for data augmentation and the evaluation of gesture-based ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Graph Learning for Cooperative Cell-Free ISAC Systems: From Optimization to Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous high-rate data transmission and high-precision radar sensing through cooperative distributed access points (APs). Fully exploiting these capabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization with multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph learning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network as a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user association, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position and velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous graph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight mirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework. The dynamic graph learning framework employs structural and temporal attention mechanisms integrated with a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), enabling superior performance and robustness in cell-free ISAC environments. Conversely, the mirror-GAT framework significantly reduces computational complexity and signaling overhead through a bi-level iterative structure with share adjacency. Simulation results validate that both proposed graph-learning-based frameworks achieve significant improvements in multi-target position and velocity estimation accuracy compared to conventional heuristic and optimization-based designs. Particularly, the mirror-GAT framework demonstrates substantial reductions in computational time and signaling overhead, underscoring its suitability for practical deployments.</description>

      <title>Wireless Energy Transfer Beamforming Optimization for Intelligent Transmitting Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless energy transfer (WET) is a promising technology for powering the growing ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) devices using power beacons (PBs). Recent research focuses on designing efficient PB architectures that can support numerous antennas. In this context, PBs equipped with intelligent surfaces present a promising approach, enabling physically large, reconfigurable arrays. Motivated by these advantages, this work aims to minimize the power consumption of a PB equipped with a passive intelligent transmitting surface (ITS) and a collocated digital beamforming-based feeder to charge multiple single-antenna devices. To model the PB's power consumption accurately, we consider power amplifiers nonlinearities, ITS control power, and feeder-to-ITS air interface losses. The resulting optimization problem is highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the high-power amplifier (HPA), the received power constraints at the devices, and the unit-modulus constraint imposed by the phase shifter configuration of the ITS. To tackle this issue, we apply successive convex approximation (SCA) to iteratively solve convex subproblems that jointly optimize the digital precoder and phase configuration. Given SCA's sensitivity to initialization, we propose an algorithm that ensures initialization feasibility while balancing convergence speed and solution quality. We compare the proposed ITS-equipped PB's power consumption against benchmark architectures featuring digital and hybrid analog-digital beamforming. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture efficiently scales with the number of RF chains and ITS elements. We also show that nonuniform ITS power distribution influences beamforming and can shift a device between near- and far-field regions, even with a constant aperture.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Environment Generalizability for Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and low-overhead channel state information (CSI) feedback is essential to boost the capacity of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Deep learning-based CSI feedback significantly outperforms conventional approaches. Nevertheless, current deep learning-based CSI feedback algorithms exhibit limited generalizability to unseen environments, which obviously increases the deployment cost. In this paper, we first model the distribution shift of CSI across different environments, which is composed of the distribution shift of multipath structure and a single-path. Then, EG-CsiNet is proposed as a novel CSI feedback learning framework to enhance environment-generalizability. Explicitly, EG-CsiNet comprises the modules of multipath decoupling and fine-grained alignment, which can address the distribution shift of multipath structure and a single path. Based on extensive simulations, the proposed EG-CsiNet can robustly enhance the generalizability in unseen environments compared to the state-of-the-art, especially in challenging conditions with a single source environment.</description>

      <title>OpenDPDv2: A Unified Learning and Optimization Framework for Neural Network Digital Predistortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based Digital Predistortion (DPD) stands out in improving signal quality in wideband radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) employing complex modulation. However, NN DPDs usually rely on a large number of parameters for effective linearization and can significantly contribute to the energy consumption of the digital back-end in RF systems. This paper presents OpenDPDv2, a unified framework for PA modeling, DPD learning, and model optimization to reduce power consumption while maintaining high linearization performance. The optimization techniques feature a novel DPD algorithm, TRes-DeltaGRU, alongside two energy-efficient methods. The top-performing 32-bit floating-point (FP32) TRes-DeltaGRU-DPD model achieves an Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) of -59.4 dBc and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of -42.1 dBc. By exploiting fixed-point quantization and dynamic temporal sparsity of input signals and hidden neurons, the inference energy of our model can be reduced by 4.5X while still maintaining -50.3 dBc ACPR and -35.2 dB EVM with 56% temporal sparsity. This was evaluated using a TM3.1a 200 MHz bandwidth 256-QAM OFDM signal applied to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA. OpenDPDv2 code, datasets, and documentation are publicly accessible at: https://github.com/lab-emi/OpenDPD.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Position Optimization for Fluid STAR-RIS-NOMA Assisted Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the limitations of traditional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in spatial control capability, this paper introduces the concept of the fluid antenna system (FAS) and proposes a fluid simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (FSTAR-RIS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multi-user communication system. In this system, each FSTAR-RIS element is capable of flexible mobility and can dynamically adjust its position in response to environmental variations, thereby enabling simultaneous service to users in both the transmission and reflection zones. This significantly enhances the system's spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) and service adaptability. To maximize the system's weighted sum-rate, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem that jointly optimizes the base station beamforming, the transmission/reflection coefficients of the FSTAR-RIS, and the element positions. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, incorporating successive convex approximation (SCA), semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques. In particular, to address the complex channel coupling introduced by the coexistence of direct and FSTAR-RIS paths, the MM framework is employed in the element position optimization subproblem, enabling an efficient iterative solution strategy. Simulation results validate that the proposed system achieves up to a 27% increase in total sum rate compared to traditional STAR-RIS systems and requires approximately 50% fewer RIS elements to attain the same performance, highlighting its effectiveness for cost-efficient large-scale deployment.</description>

      <title>Precise Representation Model of SAR Saturated Interference: Mechanism and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is highly susceptible to Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). Due to the performance limitations of components such as gain controllers and analog-to-digital converters in SAR receivers, high-power interference can easily cause saturation of the SAR receiver, resulting in nonlinear distortion of the interfered echoes, which are distorted in both the time domain and frequency domain. Some scholars have analyzed the impact of SAR receiver saturation on target echoes through simulations. However, the saturation function has non-smooth characteristics, making it difficult to conduct accurate analysis using traditional analytical methods. Current related studies have approximated and analyzed the saturation function based on the hyperbolic tangent function, but there are approximation errors. Therefore, this paper proposes a saturation interference analysis model based on Bessel functions, and verifies the accuracy of the proposed saturation interference analysis model by simulating and comparing it with the traditional saturation model based on smooth function approximation. This model can provide certain guidance for further work such as saturation interference suppression.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning-based MARL for Strengthening Physical-Layer Security in B5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of a federated learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enhance physical-layer security (PLS) in a multi-cellular network within the context of beyond 5G networks. At each cell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of legitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts to intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its authorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only share their network parameters with a central server and not the private data of their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and Reinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results demonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the distributed DRL approach. Furthermore, the outcomes illustrate the trade-off between security and complexity.</description>

      <title>How to Bridge the Sim-to-Real Gap in Digital Twin-Aided Telecommunication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training effective artificial intelligence models for telecommunications is challenging due to the scarcity of deployment-specific data. Real data collection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the unique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network environment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as simulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate site-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there is a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews recent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital twins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real gap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between digital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two conceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the level of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training loss via prediction-powered inference.</description>

      <title>Joint Target Acquisition and Refined Position Estimation in OFDM-based ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses joint target acquisition and position estimation in an OFDM-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network with base station (BS) cooperation via a fusion center. A two-stage framework is proposed: in the first stage, each BS computes range-angle maps to detect targets and estimate coarse positions, exploiting spatial diversity. In the second stage, refined localization is performed using a cooperative maximum likelihood (ML) estimator over predefined regions of interest (RoIs) within a shared global reference frame. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves detection performance through BS cooperation but also achieves centimeter-level localization accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the refined estimation technique.</description>

      <title>Detection of Intelligent Tampering in Wireless Electrocardiogram Signals Using Hybrid Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) systems for health monitoring and authentication, protecting signal integrity against tampering is becoming increasingly important. This paper analyzes the performance of CNN, ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection. It also evaluates the performance of a Siamese network for ECG based identity verification. Six tampering strategies, including structured segment substitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks. The one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional representation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The models are trained and evaluated using ECG data from 54 subjects recorded in four sessions 2019 to 2025 outside of clinical settings while the subjects performed seven different daily activities. Experimental results show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN, FeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding 99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent from A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B substitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity verification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy of 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model delivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy.</description>

      <title>eegFloss: A Python package for refining sleep EEG recordings using machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However, EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific) factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15 participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax. Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their outcomes.</description>

      <title>COS2A: Conversion from Sentinel-2 to AVIRIS Hyperspectral Data Using Interpretable Algorithm With Spectral-Spatial Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sentinel-2 satellite, launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), offers extensive spatial coverage and has become indispensable in a wide range of remote sensing applications. However, it just has 12 spectral bands, making substances/objects identification less effective, not mentioning the varying spatial resolutions (10/20/60 m) across the 12 bands. If such a multi-resolution 12-band image can be computationally converted into a hyperspectral image with uniformly high resolution (i.e., 10 m), it significantly facilitates remote identification tasks. Though there are some spectral super-resolution methods, they did not address the multi-resolution issue on one hand, and, more seriously, they mostly focused on the CAVE-level hyperspectral image reconstruction (involving only 31 visible bands) on the other hand, greatly limiting their applicability in real-world remote sensing scenarios. We ambitiously aim to convert Sentinel-2 data directly into NASA's AVIRIS-level hyperspectral image (encompassing up to 172 visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands, after ignoring those absorption/corruption ones). For the first time, this paper solves this specific super-resolution problem (highly ill-posed), allowing all historical Sentinel-2 data to have their corresponding high-standard AVIRIS counterparts. We achieve so by customizing a novel algorithm that introduces deep unfolding regularization and Q-quadratic-norm regularization into the so-called convex/deep (CODE) small-data learning criterion. Based on the derived spectral-spatial duality, the proposed interpretable COS2A algorithm demonstrates superior spectral super-resolution results across diverse land cover types, as validated through extensive experiments.</description>

The existing model-based solutions found in the literature are inefficient and/or computationally demanding. Similarly, conventional deep neural networks may struggle in the face of high-dimensional inputs, require complex architectures, and their convergence is slow due to training numerous hyperparameters. The proposed HQCNN leverages parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) relying on superposition for enhanced feature extraction. Specifically, we exploit the same PQC across all the convolutional layers for customizing the neural network and for accelerating the convergence. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed HQCNN offers a total network throughput close to that of the excessive-complexity exhaustive search and outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Soft Robotics-Inspired Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a novel soft continuum robot-inspired antenna array is proposed, featuring tentacle-like structures with multiple antenna elements. The proposed array achieves reconfigurability through continuous deformation of its geometry, in contrast to reconfigurable antennas which incur a per-element control. More specifically, the deformation is modeled by amplitude and spatial frequency parameters. We consider a multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink system, whereby the optimal deformation parameters are found to maximize the sum rate in the network. A successive convex approximation method is adopted to solve the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed deformable array significantly outperforms fixed geometry and per-element reconfigurable arrays in sum rate, demonstrating the benefits of structure-level flexibility for next-generation antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Short-term State Forecasting in Power Systems across Domains and Time Scales: A Hydroelectric Power Plant Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate short-term state forecasting is essential for efficient and stable operation of modern power systems, especially in the context of increasing variability introduced by renewable and distributed energy resources. As these systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior. Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical - which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multichannel audio mixer and limiter designs are conventionally decoupled for content reproduction over loudspeaker arrays due to high computational complexity and run-time costs. We propose a coupled mixer-limiter-envelope design formulated as an efficient linear-constrained quadratic program that minimizes a distortion objective over multichannel gain variables subject to sample mixture constraints. Novel methods for asymmetric constant overlap-add window optimization, objective function approximation, variable and constraint reduction are presented. Experiments demonstrate distortion reduction of the coupled design, and computational trade-offs required for efficient real-time processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for modeling first-order Ambisonic (FOA) room impulse responses (RIRs). PINNs have demonstrated promising performance in sound field interpolation by combining the powerful modeling capability of neural networks and the physical principles of sound propagation. In room acoustics, PINNs have typically been trained to represent the sound pressure measured by omnidirectional microphones where the wave equation or its frequency-domain counterpart, i.e., the Helmholtz equation, is leveraged. Meanwhile, FOA RIRs additionally provide spatial characteristics and are useful for immersive audio generation with a wide range of applications. In this paper, we extend the PINN framework to model FOA RIRs. We derive two physics-informed priors for FOA RIRs based on the correspondence between the particle velocity and the (X, Y, Z)-channels of FOA. These priors associate the predicted W-channel and other channels through their partial derivatives and impose the physically feasible relationship on the four channels. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with a neural network without the physics-informed prior.</description>

      <title>Beyond Connectivity: An Open Architecture for AI-RAN Convergence in 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications at the network edge demands a fundamental shift in RAN design, from merely consuming AI for network optimization, to actively enabling distributed AI workloads. This paradigm shift presents a significant opportunity for network operators to monetize AI at the edge while leveraging existing infrastructure investments. To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged O-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both telecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed architecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and cloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key architectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and allocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide distributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The proposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to be orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch processing) and geographic targeting. The proposed architecture addresses the orchestration requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different time scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor interoperability.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cognitive Networks: Reinforcement Learning Meets Energy Harvesting Over Cascaded Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to improve the physical layer security (PLS) of an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN) over cascaded channels. These channels are utilized in highly mobile networks such as cognitive vehicular networks (CVN). In addition, an eavesdropper aims to intercept the communications between secondary users (SUs). The SU receiver has full-duplex and energy harvesting capabilities to generate jamming signals to confound the eavesdropper and enhance security. Moreover, the SU transmitter extracts energy from ambient radio frequency signals in order to power subsequent transmissions to its intended receiver. To optimize the privacy and reliability of the SUs in a CVN, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is utilized where multiple DQN agents are required such that an agent is assigned at each SU transmitter. The objective for the SUs is to determine the optimal transmission power and decide whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time period in order to maximize their secrecy rate. Thereafter, we propose a DQN approach to maximize the throughput of the SUs while respecting the interference threshold acceptable at the receiver of the primary user. According to our findings, our strategy outperforms two other baseline strategies in terms of security and reliability.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Reliability in Overlay Radio Networks with Time Switching and Power Splitting Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are acknowledged for their ability to tackle the issue of spectrum under-utilization. In the realm of CRNs, this paper investigates the energy efficiency issue and addresses the critical challenge of optimizing system reliability for overlay CRN access mode. Randomly dispersed secondary users (SUs) serving as relays for primary users (PUs) are considered, in which one of these relays is designated to harvest energy through the time switching-energy harvesting (EH) protocol. Moreover, this relay amplifies-and-forwards (AF) the PU's messages and broadcasts them along with its own across cascaded $\kappa$-$\mu$ fading channels. The power splitting protocol is another EH approach utilized by the SU and PU receivers to enhance the amount of energy in their storage devices. In addition, the SU transmitters and the SU receiver are deployed with multiple antennas for reception and apply the maximal ratio combining approach. The outage probability is utilized to assess both networks' reliability. Then, an energy efficiency evaluation is performed to determine the effectiveness of EH on the system. Finally, an optimization problem is provided with the goal of maximizing the data rate of the SUs by optimizing the time switching and the power allocation parameters of the SU relay.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, an edge-side model training study is conducted on a resource-limited smart meter. The motivation of grid-edge intelligence and the concept of on-device training are introduced. Then, the technical preparation steps for on-device training are described. A case study on the task of photovoltaic power forecasting is presented, where two representative machine learning models are investigated: a gradient boosting tree model and a recurrent neural network model. To adapt to the resource-limited situation in the smart meter, "mixed"- and "reduced"-precision training schemes are also devised. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of economically achieving grid-edge intelligence via the existing advanced metering infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning at the Edge: The Cost of Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an alternative to traditional supervised machine learning solutions by enabling rich representations from unstructured and unlabeled data. However, CL and, more broadly, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often demand a large amount of data and computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility and efficiency of SSL techniques for edge-based learning, focusing on trade-offs between model performance and energy efficiency. In particular, we analyze how different SSL techniques adapt to limited computational, data, and energy budgets, evaluating their effectiveness in learning robust representations under resource-constrained settings. Moreover, we also consider the energy costs involved in labeling data and assess how semi-supervised learning may assist in reducing the overall energy consumed to train CL models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that tailored SSL strategies can achieve competitive performance while reducing resource consumption by up to 4X, underscoring their potential for energy-efficient learning at the edge.</description>

      <title>Advances in Intelligent Hearing Aids: Deep Learning Approaches to Selective Noise Cancellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into hearing assistance marks a paradigm shift from traditional amplification-based systems to intelligent, context-aware audio processing. This systematic literature review evaluates advances in AI-driven selective noise cancellation (SNC) for hearing aids, highlighting technological evolution, implementation challenges, and future research directions. We synthesize findings across deep learning architectures, hardware deployment strategies, clinical validation studies, and user-centric design. The review traces progress from early machine learning models to state-of-the-art deep networks, including Convolutional Recurrent Networks for real-time inference and Transformer-based architectures for high-accuracy separation. Key findings include significant gains over traditional methods, with recent models achieving up to 18.3 dB SI-SDR improvement on noisy-reverberant benchmarks, alongside sub-10 ms real-time implementations and promising clinical outcomes. Yet, challenges remain in bridging lab-grade models with real-world deployment - particularly around power constraints, environmental variability, and personalization. Identified research gaps include hardware-software co-design, standardized evaluation protocols, and regulatory considerations for AI-enhanced hearing devices. Future work must prioritize lightweight models, continual learning, contextual-based classification and clinical translation to realize transformative hearing solutions for millions globally.</description>

      <title>Incremental Averaging Method to Improve Graph-Based Time-Difference-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the position of a speech source based on time-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) is often adversely affected by background noise and reverberation. A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a microphone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone pairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of microphone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of microphone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently a more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs by computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT function reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on the TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT functions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral densities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we increase the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs computed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals recorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially distributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations and three reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering multiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation accuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely on a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position estimation.</description>

      <title>Beampattern Design for Transmit Architectures Based on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15297v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of beampattern design for a transmit system employing a large reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to redirect radio frequency signals emitted by a few active antennas (sources). We begin by establishing a convenient signal model and discussing the impact of signal bandwidth, source-RIS channel, and system geometry on our derivations. Subsequently, we propose a joint optimization of the waveform emitted by each source and the phase shifts introduced by the RIS. The objective is to match a desired space-frequency distribution of the far-field radiation pattern, relevant to both radar and communication applications. We present a sub-optimal solution to this problem, subject to a constraint on the total power radiated by the sources and, optionally, on the constant modulus of the waveforms. The provided example demonstrates the effective beampattern shaping capabilities of this RIS-based transmit architecture. Specifically, for the same array size and the same desired radiation pattern, the resulting approximation error is comparable to that obtained with a fully-digital MIMO array, especially when constant-modulus waveforms are enforced, and significantly smaller than that of a phased array.</description>

      <title>CFARNet: Learning-Based High-Resolution Multi-Target Detection for Rainbow Beam Radar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) OFDM radar equipped with rainbow beamforming, enabled by phase-time arrays (PTAs), provides wide-angle coverage and is well-suited for fast real-time target detection and tracking. However, accurate detection of multiple closely spaced targets remains a key challenge for conventional signal processing pipelines, particularly those relying on constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors. This paper presents CFARNet, a learning-based processing framework that replaces CFAR with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for peak detection in the angle-Doppler domain. The network predicts target subcarrier indices, which guide angle estimation via a known frequency-angle mapping and enable high-resolution range and velocity estimation using the MUSIC algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that CFARNet significantly outperforms a baseline combining CFAR and MUSIC, especially under low transmit power and dense multi-target conditions. The proposed method offers superior angular resolution, enhanced robustness in low-SNR scenarios, and improved computational efficiency, highlighting the potential of data-driven approaches for high-resolution mmWave radar sensing.</description>

      <title>A Direct Comparison of Simultaneously Recorded Scalp, Around-Ear, and In-Ear EEG for Neural Selective Auditory Attention Decoding to Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current assistive hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, lack the ability to adapt to the listener's focus of auditory attention, limiting their effectiveness in complex acoustic environments like cocktail party scenarios where multiple conversations occur simultaneously. Neuro-steered hearing devices aim to overcome this limitation by decoding the listener's auditory attention from neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). While many auditory attention decoding (AAD) studies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for daily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and unobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for long-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have shown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering superior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with simultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct comparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a significant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD accuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s decision windows. These results highlight the trade-off between decoding performance and practical usability. Yet, while the ear-based systems using basic algorithms might currently not yield accurate enough performances for a decision speed-sensitive application in hearing aids, their significant performance suggests potential for attention monitoring on longer timescales. Furthermore, adding an external reference or a few scalp electrodes via greedy forward selection substantially and quickly boosts accuracy by over 10 percent point, especially for in-ear EEG. These findings position in-ear EEG as a promising component in EEG sensor networks for AAD.</description>

      <title>Experimental Multiport-Network Parameter Estimation and Optimization for Multi-Bit RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-consistent theoretical studies on RIS-parametrized wireless channels use models from multiport-network theory (MNT) to capture mutual-coupling (MC) effects. However, in practice, RIS design and radio environment are partially or completely unknown. We fill a research gap on how to estimate the MNT model parameters in such experimentally relevant scenarios. Our technique efficiently combines closed-form and gradient-descent steps, and it can be applied to multi-bit-programmable RIS elements. We discuss inevitable (but operationally irrelevant) parameter ambiguities. We experimentally validate our technique in an unknown rich-scattering environment parametrized by eight 6-bit-programmable RIS elements of unknown design. We experimentally evaluate the performance of RIS configurations optimized with the estimated MNT model and an MC-unaware cascaded model. While the models differ in accuracy by up to 17 dB, the end-to-end performance differences are small.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Bounds for Lossy Common Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the mutual information between the targets in a Gray-Wyner Network as a bound that separates Wyner's lossy common information and G\'acs-K\"orner lossy common information. The results are a generalization of the lossless case presented by Wyner (1975).</description>
