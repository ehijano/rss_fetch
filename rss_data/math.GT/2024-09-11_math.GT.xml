      <title>Deformations of Lipschitz Homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the Lipschitz analogues of the results Perelman used from Siebenmann's deformation of homeomorphism theory in his proof of the stability theorem. Consequently, we obtain the Lipschitz analogue of Perelman's gluing theorem. Moreover, we obtain the analogous deformation theory but with tracking of the Lipschitz constants.</description>

      <title>Generating Extended Mapping Class Groups with Two Periodic Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended mapping class group of a surface $\Sigma$ is defined to be the group of isotopy classes of (not necessarily orientation-preserving) homeomorphisms of $\Sigma$. We are able to show that the extended mapping class group of an $n$-punctured sphere is generated by two elements of finite order exactly when $n\not=4$. We use this result to prove that the extended mapping class group of a genus 2 surface is generated by two elements of finite order.</description>

Abstract: We show that, in the unit tangent bundle of a hyperbolic orbisphere with cone points of order 3, 3, 4, the lift of the shortest periodic geodesic is homeomorphic to the complement of the figure-eight knot in the 3-sphere. The proof eventually relies on the computation of some linking numbers.</description>

      <title>Positive entropy actions by higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study smooth actions by lattices $\Gamma$ in higher-rank simple Lie groups $G$ assuming one element of the action acts with positive topological entropy and prove a number of new rigidity results. For lattices $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ acting on $n$-manifolds, if the action has positive topological entropy we show the lattice must be commensurable with $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$. Moreover, such actions admit an absolutely continuous probability measure with positive metric entropy; adapting arguments by Katok and Rodriguez Hertz, we show such actions are measurably conjugate to affine actions on (infra)tori.
  In our main technical arguments, we study families of probability measures invariant under sub-actions of the induced $G$-action on an associated fiber bundle. To control entropy properties of such measures, in the appendix we establish certain upper semicontinuity of entropy under weak-$*$ convergence, adapting classical results of Yomdin and Newhouse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we prove that $H^*(\text{BSO}(4);\mathbb{Q})$ injects into the group cohomology of $\text{Diff}^+(S^{3})$ with rational coefficients. The proof is based on an idea of Nariman who proved that the monomials in the Euler and Pontrjagin classes are nontrivial in $H^*(\text{BDiff}_+^{\delta}(S^{2n-1});\mathbb{Q})$.</description>

      <title>Siegel-Veech Constants for Cyclic Covers of Generic Translation Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic number of cylinders, weighted by their area to any non-negative power, on any cyclic branched cover of any generic translation surface in any stratum. Our formulas depend only on topological invariants of the cover and number-theoretic properties of the degree: in particular, the ratio of the related Siegel-Veech constants for the locus of covers and for the base stratum component is independent of the number of branch values. One surprising corollary is that this ratio for $area^3$ Siegel-Veech constants is always equal to the reciprocal of the the degree of the cover. A key ingredient is a classification of the connected components of certain loci of cyclic branched covers.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap of scl in graphs of groups and $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.14146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stable commutator length scl_G(g) of an element g in a group G is an invariant for group elements sensitive to the geometry and dynamics of G.
  For any group G acting on a tree, we prove a sharp bound scl_G(g)&gt;=1/2 for any g acting without fixed points, provided that the stabilizer of each edge is relatively torsion-free in its vertex stabilizers. The sharp gap becomes 1/2-1/n if the edge stabilizers are n-relatively torsion-free in vertex stabilizers. We also compute scl_G for elements acting with a fixed point.
  This implies many such groups have a spectral gap, that is, there is a constant C&gt;0 such that either scl_G(g)&gt;=C or scl_G(g)=0. New examples include the fundamental group of any 3-manifold using the JSJ decomposition, though the gap must depend on the manifold. We also obtain the optimal spectral gap of graph products of group without 2-torsion.
  We prove these statements by characterizing maps of surfaces to a suitable K(G,1). For groups acting on trees, we also construct explicit quasimorphisms and apply Bavard's duality to give a different proof of our spectral gap theorem under stronger assumptions.</description>

      <title>Quasi Normality and PL Approximation of Least Area Surfaces in 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This} paper presents relations between least area and normal surfaces, embedded in either a Euclidean or hyperbolic $3$-manifold. A relaxed version of normal surfaces, termed quasi-normal, is introduced, and it is shown that under appropriate conditions, every embedded least area surface is quasi-normal with respect to a fine enough fat triangulation of the $3$-manifold. In addition, it is shown that the intersections of a least area surface with the tetrahedra of such fine enough triangulation, even when not as simple as in the case of normal surfaces, are also well behaved. Finally, it is shown that a least area surface, when considered as a quasi normal surface, gives rise to a sequence of piecewise flat surfaces termed as flat-associated surfaces, and this sequence converges to the given least area surface and approximates its area.</description>

      <title>Topology of matching complexes of complete graphs via discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02973v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bouc first studied the topological properties of the matching complex of the complete graph of order $n$, denoted by $M_n$, in connection with Brown complexes and Quillen complexes. Later Bj\"{o}rner et al. showed that $M_n$ is homotopically $(\nu_n-1)$-connected, where $\nu_n=\lfloor{\frac{n+1}{3}}\rfloor-1$, and conjectured that this connectivity bound is sharp. Shareshian and Wachs settled the conjecture by inductively showing that the $\nu_n$-dimensional homology group of $M_n$ is nontrivial, with Bouc's calculation $H_1(M_7)$ serving as the pivotal base step. In general, the topology of $M_n$ is not very well-understood, even for a small $n$. In the present article, we look into the topology of $M_n$, and $M_7$ in particular, in the light of discrete Morse theory as developed by Forman. We first construct a gradient vector field on $M_n$ (for $n \ge 5$) that doesn't admit any critical simplices of dimension up to $\nu_n-1$, except one unavoidable $0$-simplex, which also leads to the aforementioned $(\nu_n-1)$-connectedness of $M_n$ in a purely combinatorial way. However, for an efficient homology computation by discrete Morse theoretic techniques, we are required to work with a gradient vector field that admits a low number of critical simplices, and also allows an efficient enumeration of gradient paths. An optimal gradient vector field is one with the least number of critical simplices, but the problem of finding an optimal gradient vector field, in general, is an NP-hard problem (even for $2$-dimensional complexes). We improve the gradient vector field constructed on $M_7$ in particular to a much more efficient (near-optimal) one, and then with the help of this improved gradient vector field, compute the homology groups of $M_7$ in an efficient and algorithmic manner. We also augment this near-optimal gradient vector field to one that we conjecture to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Morse homology with DG coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Morse homology and cohomology with coefficients in a derived local system, for manifolds and also more generally for colimits of spaces that have the homotopy type of manifolds, with a view towards Floer theory. The model that we adopt for derived, or differential graded (DG) local systems is that of DG modules over chains on the based loop space of a manifold. These encompass both classical (non DG) local systems and chains on fibers of Hurewicz fibrations. We prove that the Morse homology and cohomology groups that we construct are isomorphic to DG Tor and Ext functors. The key ingredient in the definition is a notion of twisting cocycle obtained by evaluating into based loops a coherent system of representatives for the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Morse trajectories of arbitrary dimensions. From this perspective, our construction sits midway between classical Morse homology with twisted coefficients and more refined invariants of Floer homotopical flavor. The construction of the twisting cocycle is originally due to Barraud and Cornea with Z/2-coefficients. We show that the twisting cocycle with integer coefficients is equivalent to Brown's universal twisting cocycle. We prove that Morse homology with coefficients in chains on the fiber of a Hurewicz fibration recovers the homology of the total space of the fibration. We study several structural properties of the theory: invariance, functoriality, and Poincar\'e duality, also in the nonorientable case.</description>
