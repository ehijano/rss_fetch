      <title>A Binary-Based Reassessment of the Age and Stellar Properties of NGC 7789 Using Twelve Binary Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a binary-based reassessment of the age of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 7789, together with well-constrained stellar parameters for twelve components in six SB2 systems, including two eclipsing binaries. Our analysis employs a unified modelling framework that combines radial-velocity orbits, TESS light curves, and blue-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs), providing a robust alternative to traditional isochrone-based age determinations. By adopting common cluster-wide parameters (age, distance, and line-of-sight extinction) when solving for the stellar parameters of the binary components, we obtain a coherent set of masses, radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for all twelve stars. The combined SED, eclipsing-binary, and radial-velocity analysis yields a well-constrained cluster age of $1.26 \pm 0.09$ Gyr and an extinction of $A_V = 0.90 \pm 0.05$ mag, while remaining consistent with the Gaia DR3 distance of $d \simeq 2.06$ kpc used as an external prior. An independent Gaia DR3 astrometric analysis gives a distance of $2082 \pm 142$ pc and confirms the membership of all six systems. The twelve binary components occupy the turnoff and subgiant regions of the cluster, enabling stringent evolutionary tests: in the radius--mass, radius--temperature, and temperature--mass diagrams, they show excellent agreement with modern stellar evolution models for the derived cluster parameters. NGC 7789 thus serves as a valuable benchmark for multi-observable, binary-based age determinations in open cluster studies.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Study of A Superflare on RS CVn-type Star HD22468 Triggered at Hard X-ray by SVOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of stellar flares at hard X-ray is still rare at the current stage. A transient was recently detected by the hard X-ray camera, ECLAIRs onboard the SVOM mission at 11:39:01.2UT on 2025, January 09. Simultaneous monitor in the optical band on the ground by SVOM/GWAC and follow-up spectroscopy enable us to confirm that the transient is caused by a superflare on HD~22468, a RS CVn-type star. The bolometric energy released in the flare is estimated to be $\sim7.2\times10^{37}-1.7\times10^{38}\ \mathrm{erg}$. The hard X-ray spectra of the event at the peak can be reproduced by the ``apec'' model of a hot plasma with a temperature of $106^{+27}_{-22}$~MK. In the optical range, the H$\alpha$ emission-line profile obtained at $\sim1.7$ hrs after the trigger shows a bulk blueshift of $-96\pm20\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, which can be explained by either a chromospheric evaporation or a prominence eruption. The ejected mass is estimated to be $3.9\times10^{20}$ g for the evaporating plasma, and to be $3.2\times10^{21}\ \mathrm{g}&lt;M_{\mathrm{p}}&lt;8.8\times10^{21}\ \mathrm{g}$ for the erupted prominence.</description>

      <title>Superhumps in active dwarf novae. Part I: ER Ursae Majoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report photometry results of a frequently outbursting dwarf nova, ER Ursae Majoris. To measure the outburst parameters of the system, we carried out analyses of the light curve, periodograms, and O-C diagrams. We investigated the system's behaviour using the ground-based optical data and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data. During these observation runs, we scrutinised three superoutbursts and several normal outbursts. We detected ordinary and late superhumps during each of the investigated superoutbursts. We derived the period excess value $\epsilon \approx 3.0(1)\% $. This suggests that over the last 30 years, ER UMa has not shifted on the evolutionary path toward period-bounce objects. Between 1992 and 2022, the interval between two successive superoutbursts (the supercycle length) changed significantly from 42.1 days to 59.6 days, which indicates that the mean mass-transfer rate of ER UMa has been decreasing over this period.</description>

      <title>Gaia20dsk: A new MNor discovered by the GLORIOUS collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Among known young stellar objects (YSOs), those exhibiting the most dramatic increases in brightness due to sudden increase in mass accretion rate are eruptive young stars. Gaia20dsk is one of the Gaia-alerted young star candidates that has displayed a double, nonperiodic brightening resembling that of other young eruptive stars.
  Aims. The goal of this work is to determine the physical and accretion properties of Gaia20dsk to confirm its classification as an eruptive young star.
  Methods. We combined publicly available optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry with our X-shooter optical/NIR spectrum. In our analysis, we examined the optical and IR light curves from the bursts, reviewing the color-magnitude diagrams across different bands, reporting the detection of emission lines, and providing estimates of the star's accretion rates during the burst.
  Results. The optical light curve shows two major and one brief brightening events with a maximum amplitude of ~1.8 mag in the last five years. A classification based on spectral index indicates that Gaia20dsk is a flat-spectrum star. The X-shooter spectrum exhibit emission lines characteristic of accreting low-to-intermediate-mass young stars, displaying features typical of MNor-type objects. The mass accretion rate is between (0.5-1.8)*10^{-6} M_sun/yr.
  Conclusions. Gaia20dsk is an eruptive YSO that exhibits photometric features similar to those of MNors, including its characteristic brightening amplitude and burst duration, along with similar spectroscopic features and accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Six New Circumbinary Disk Occultation (CBO) Candidates from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumbinary disk occultation (CBO) systems, in which a misaligned circumbinary disk periodically obscures the central binary, provide unique probes of disk structure and dynamics. However, fewer than ten candidates with measured orbital periods were previously known. In this work, we identify six new CBO candidates, designated ZTF-CBO-1 through ZTF-CBO-6, through a systematic search of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) photometry. These systems exhibit deep ($\gtrsim$1 mag) periodic dimming events with orbital periods ranging from $\sim$30 to $\sim$530 days and occultation durations spanning 32%-77% of their orbital periods. Such large duty cycles rule out the interpretation of circum-companion material occultation. Spectral energy distributions of ZTF-CBO-1 and ZTF-CBO-2 reveal infrared excess indicative of a dust component. TESS observations of ZTF-CBO-1 show no hours- to days-timescale variability during ingress and egress, indicating a smooth disk edge. These discoveries nearly double the known CBO sample, enabling meaningful population-level studies.</description>

      <title>Drawing the line between explosion and collapse in electron-capture supernovae -- I. Impact of conductive flame speeds and ignition conditions on the explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) are commonly thought to result in a collapse to a neutron star. Recent work has shown that a thermonuclear explosion is also a possible outcome. The division between the two regimes has not yet been mapped out. In this study, we investigate the conditions under which the transition from thermonuclear explosion to collapse occurs, and what physical mechanisms drive each outcome. We conducted a parameter study of 56 3D hydrodynamic simulations of ECSN in ONe white dwarfs using a level set based flame model implemented in the Leafs code. We varied both the ignition location and the central density at ignition to determine the conditions of the transition regime. Additionally, we explored two different laminar flame parameterizations and how they impact the simulation outcome. From our parameter study, we find a transition density in the range of $\log\rho_c^{ini}=10.0$ and $10.15$ g cm$^{-3}$, depending on the ignition location and utilized laminar flame speed parameterization. Importantly, we find that for sufficiently high central densities, the burned ashes can sink into the core and trap large amounts of neutron-rich material in the bound remnant. In the transition regime between explosion and collapse, we find that the laminar flame speed plays a critical role by suppressing the formation of instabilities and thereby reducing the nuclear energy generation needed to overcome the collapse. We find that a thermonuclear explosion is possible for a wide range of parameters, whereby a more off-center ignition allows for higher central densities to still result in an explosion. Both the conditions at ignition and the flame physics are critical in determining the outcome. Detailed 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the preceding stellar evolution and the ignition process of the thermonuclear flame are necessary to accurately predict the outcome of ECSNe.</description>

      <title>Fast Magnetoacoustic Wave Behavior with Gravitationally Stratified, Magnetically Inhomogeneous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of MHD waves within inhomogeneous media is fundamental to understanding and interpreting wave behavior in the solar atmosphere. We investigate fast magnetoacoustic wave behavior within gravitationally stratified, magnetically inhomogeneous media, by studying a magnetic environment containing a simple 2D X-type magnetic null point. The addition of gravitational stratification fundamentally changes the nature of the system, including breaking the symmetry. There are two main governing effects: the stratified density profile acts in combination with the inhomogeneous magnetic field, creating a large gradient in the Alfven speed and hence a system replete with refraction. The system is investigated using both numerical simulations and a semianalytical WKB solution (via Charpit's method and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver) and we find strong agreement between both. The results show a fundamental difference between the stratification-free and stratified cases, including the formation of caustic surfaces and cusps, and we contextualize these results in the theoretical understanding of fast magnetoacoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Gaia DR3-Based Astrometric, Photometric, and Kinematic Studies of the Binary Open Cluster $h$ and $\chi$ Persei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Gaia era, a comprehensive analysis of the binary open clusters NGC 869 (h Persei) and NGC 884 (chi Persei) system has been conducted to investigate its structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and Galactic orbital properties, along with its dynamical evolution. By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, it has been determined that 808 stars in NGC 869 and 707 stars in NGC 884 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. The fundamental astrophysical parameters of the clusters were inferred within a Bayesian framework using Gaia data and PARSEC stellar evolutionary isochrones, through the application of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The estimated parameters are: colour excess E(B-V) = 0.516 +0.17/-0.24 mag and 0.516 +0.22/-0.33 mag, distances 2376 +301/-278 and 2273 +230/-290 pc, ages log(t/yr) = 7.31 +0.17/-0.32 and log(t/yr) = 7.30 +0.13/-0.29, and metallicities [Fe/H] = -0.24 +/- 0.12 and [Fe/H] = -0.25 +/- 0.12 dex for NGC 869 and NGC 884, respectively. Since spectroscopic observations are not available for the clusters, SED analysis was employed for the member stars, yielding results consistent with those obtained using the MCMC method. Kinematic and Galactic orbital analyses suggest that the open clusters originated in nearby regions of the Galaxy. This interpretation is supported by their similar space velocities and Galactic orbital parameters. Furthermore, orbital integration over 1 Gyr indicates a potential interaction between the clusters within the next 11 Myr. This study provides strong evidence of a common origin and a possible future dynamical interaction, contributing valuable insights into the formation and evolution of binary open clusters in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Accretion Rate Changes Detected in a Polluted White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter reports statistically significant changes in the equivalent widths of MgII and CaII lines in the dusty and polluted white dwarf WD 0106-328, based on six epochs of spectroscopy using the VLT and Keck spanning 25 yr. Furthermore, the ratio of these two equivalent widths may also vary, with a 7% probability of being constant. Between 2000 and 2025, both Mg and Ca have experienced decreases in accretion rates, of approximately 20 and 60%, respectively, but with individual variation during the interim. These metal abundance decreases are the first empirical corroboration of diffusion theory in white dwarfs, which predict sinking timescales on the order of days for this star. However, the persistent atmospheric metals require a more gradual, circumstellar process, where one possibility is viscous spreading in an ionized disk of metals, consistent with $\alpha\approx0.1$ within that formalism. The combination of optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope detects all the major rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, Fe), and demonstrates that Fe dominates the accreted material by mass, and that it is delivered mostly as pure metal from within a differentiated parent body. This inference is consistent with the possibility that chemically-segregated accretion may result from a combination of planetary assembly, fragmentation, disk evolution, and be observed on relatively short timescales.</description>

      <title>proto-Lightspeed: a high-speed, ultra-low read noise imager on the Magellan Clay Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: proto-Lightspeed is a new instrument that has been commissioned on the Nasmyth East port of the Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to deliver high-speed optical imaging with deep sub-electron read noise. Making use of commercial re-imaging lenses and the ORCA-Quest 2 camera from Hamamatsu, proto-Lightspeed images a field $1'$ in diameter at up to $200$ Hz or windowed fields at higher rates, up to 6600 Hz for a $1.6''\times 1'$ field of view. proto-Lightspeed delivers seeing-limited image quality in the $g'$, $r'$, and $i'$ bands and adjustable magnification for pixel scales between $0.017''-0.050''$. proto-Lightspeed is well suited to studying compact binary systems, exoplanet transits, rapid flaring associated with accretion, periodic optical emission from pulsars, occultations of background stars by small trans-Neptunian Objects, and any other rapidly variable source. proto-Lightspeed will be a P.I. instrument beginning in 2026B, available for use by members of the Magellan Consortium. In this paper, we discuss the design and performance of the instrument, results from its two commissioning runs, and plans for a facility instrument, Lightspeed, to support simultaneous multicolor imaging across a $7'\times4'$ field.</description>

      <title>TOI-6692b: An eccentric 130 day period giant planet with a single transit from TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of TOI-6692 b, an eccentric (e~0.54) Jupiter on a 130-day orbit. TOI-6692 b was first detected as a community TESS Object of Interest (cTOI) by the Visual Survey Group and the Planet Hunters group as a single transit candidate via TESS observation. The period was subsequently confirmed via radial velocity monitoring from the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan telescope. Additional radial velocities were acquired with the CHIRON, FEROS, and CORALIE spectrographs. LCOGT ground-based photometric follow-up was conducted over 2 weeks to detect another transit and refine the period. Although we did not detect an ingress or egress of the 11.04 hr transit, we did detect a possible in-transit signal in the multi-night data and provide an updated ephemeris for future monitoring. TOI-6692 b is one of few planets with orbital periods longer than 100 days that have a secure mass, radius, and eccentricity detection. As with most giant planets at these orbital periods, the eccentricity of TOI-6692 b is lower than that expected of planets undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration, but is more consistent with the expectations of planet-planet scattering outcomes. A long-term radial velocity trend was detected and further monitoring is warranted to determine the outer companion period. TOI-6692 b is also one of few TESS single transit targets that have its period eventually confirmed via follow-up photometric campaigns timed to capture transits despite the relatively large ephemeris uncertainties. Such efforts highlight the capabilities of night-to-night stability on ground-based photometric facilities today.</description>

      <title>[HP99] 159 -- Properties of the first Supersoft X-ray Source with a Helium star donor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [HP99] 159 is remarkable as the first supersoft X-ray source (SSS) identified with an evolved helium star donor. With a likely orbital period of 1.164 d or 2.327 d, the origin of the SSS component is controversial, with the two current models being either steady He-burning on the white dwarf surface, or that it is a helium nova in the decaying phase. To help resolve this issue we present extensive new long-term spectroscopy (with SALT) and photometry (at SAAO and with OGLE) of [HP99] 159 which (a) supports 2.327 d as the orbital period, and (b) finds only a small He II radial velocity modulation. The latter is surprising as it implies a very low inclination system, whereas our light curve modelling suggests $i{\sim}50^\circ$, and hence that the He II must be produced in outflowing material further above, or beyond, the disc. We find that the decaying nova model cannot fit our OGLE light curve and the observed SSS flux level. [HP99] 159 has been essentially constant as an SSS over several decades, implying a sustained high level of mass-transfer from its He star donor, making it the only confirmed single-degenerate scenario SN Ia progenitor. We have updated the known SSS binary parameters and find a clear $\sim$1.5 mag difference in their $M_{\rm V}$ when compared to the $M_{\rm V} - \Sigma$ properties of LMXBs, likely due to the larger irradiated areas and more luminous donors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic threads and gravity: ALMA Observations of IRDC G14.225-0.506</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the star formation process, the interplay between gravity, turbulence, and B-fields is significant, with B-fields apparently serving a regulatory function. However, the extent to which B-fields are decisive relative to turbulence and gravity remains uncertain. This study aims to ascertain the role of B-fields in the fragmentation of molecular clouds. We examine the B-field observed with ALMA at core scales towards the infrared dark cloud G14.225-0.506, focusing on 3 regions with shared physical conditions, and juxtapose it with prior observations at the Hub-filament system scale. Our findings indicate a similar B-field strength and fragmentation level between the 2 hubs. However, distinct B-field morphologies are identified across the 3 regions where polarized emission is detected. In the region N, the large-scale B-field, which is perpendicular to the filamentary structure, persists at smaller scales in the southern half but becomes distorted near the more massive condensations in the northern half. Notably, these condensations exhibit signs of impending collapse, as evidenced by supercritical mass-to-flux values. In the region S, the B-field is considerably inhomogeneous among the detected condensations, and we do not observe a direct correlation between the field morphology and the condensation density. Lastly, in an isolated dust clump located within a southern filament of the northern hub, the B-field aligns parallel to the elongated emission, suggesting a transition in the field geometry. The B-field shows a clear evolution with spatial scales. We propose that the most massive condensations detected in the northern Hub are undergoing gravitational collapse, as revealed by the relative significance of the magnetic field and gravitational potential and mass-to-flux ratio. The distortion of the B-field could be a response to the flow of material due to the collapse.</description>

      <title>Universal relation between dipole polarizability of finite nuclei and neutron-star compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear equation of state, which determines the structure and properties of neutron stars, remains subject to substantial theoretical uncertainties, leading to model dependence in predicted observables. Universal relations have emerged as a powerful tool to mitigate this dependence by linking neutron star observables in a framework-independent manner. In this work, we introduce a new universal relation that \emph{bridges} finite nuclei and neutron stars through the dimensionless quantity $\zeta = \beta_{1.4}\tilde{L}^{-1}$, which couples the compactness of a $1.4~M_{\odot}$ neutron star to the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation. The relation is examined under a broad set of relativistic energy density functionals with point-coupling and meson-exchange interactions, as well as non-relativistic Skyrme functionals. We demonstrate that $\zeta$ exhibits a strong exponential correlation with the electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_D$ in finite nuclei across all considered equations of state. By exploiting experimental $\alpha_D$ data for selected neutron-rich nuclei, we constrain $\zeta$ and translate these constraints into equation-of-state-independent bounds on the neutron star radius $R_{1.4}$ and the symmetry-energy slope $L$, providing insights into the properties of neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of young isolated planetary mass objects in Taurus and Upper Scorpius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-floating planetary mass objects--worlds that roam interstellar space untethered to a parent star--challenge conventional notions of planetary formation and migration, but also of star and brown dwarf formation. We focus on the multiplicity among free-floating planets. By virtue of their low binding energy (compared to other objects formed in these environments), these low-mass substellar binaries represent a most sensitive probe of the mechanisms at play during the star formation process. We use the HST and its WFC3 and the VLT and its ERIS AO facility to search for visual companions among a sample of 77 objects members of the USco and Taurus young nearby associations with estimated masses in the range between approximately 6-66 M$_{\rm Jup}$. We report the discovery of one companion candidate around a Taurus member with a separation of 111.9$\pm$0.4~mas, or $\sim$18~au assuming a distance of 160~pc, with an estimated primary mass in the range between 3--6~M$_{\rm Jup}$and a secondary mass between 2.6--5.2~M$_{\rm Jup}$ depending on the assumed age. This corresponds to an overall binary fraction of 1.8$^{+2.6}_{-1.3}$\% among low-mass brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary mass objects over the separation range $\ge$7~au. Despite the limitations of small-number statistics and variations in spatial resolution and sensitivity, our results, combined with previous high-spatial-resolution surveys, suggest a notable difference in the multiplicity properties of objects below $\sim$30--50~M$_{\rm Jup}$ between USco and Taurus. In Taurus, a binary fraction of $5.6^{+3.2}_{-2.3}$\% is found for objects with masses below 30M$_{\rm Jup}$, and of $7.8^{+3.0}_{-2.4}$\% for objects with masses below 50M$_{\rm Jup}$, whereas no binary were found among 80 objects over the matching luminosity range in USco, corresponding to an upper limit of $\le$1.2\%.</description>

      <title>StarEmbed: Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models on Astronomical Observations of Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</description>

      <title>SCATTER Common Envelope Formalism for Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many stars are components of triple-star systems, or of higher-order multiples. In such systems mass transfer is common, and when the transfer is dynamically unstable, a common envelope forms. As such, it is important to be able to compute the post-common-envelope orbital separations among the various stars comprising the system, and to determine whether the common envelope induces mergers or makes later mergers inevitable. In this paper we compute the results of common-envelope evolution for triples. We employ the SCATTER formalism, a new approach to the computation of post-common-envelope separations. This work has applications to gravitational-wave mergers, Type Ia supernovae, and a broad range of other highly energetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Kinematics with the Time-Asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry (II) offers a powerful means to observe stellar objects with a high resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.</description>
