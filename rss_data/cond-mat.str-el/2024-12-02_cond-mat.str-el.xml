      <title>The example of strongly correlated electron systems from the perspective of high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we give three examples of applying high energy physics method or idea in strongly correlated electron system. The first one is considering a curved space-time hydrodynamics theory for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and rotating bilayer graphene (RBG).We have predicted the possible quantized Thouless pumping in RBG for low driven frequency as a new kind of floquet engineering. In the second example, we study the C=2 fractioanl Chern insulator (FCI) candidate in twisted bilayer checkboard lattice (TBCB). We interpret the quasi-hole counting in particle entanglement spectrum (PES) based on SU(2) Halperin spin singlet ansatz and generalized Pauli principle, which is similar to the SU(C) color singlet in high energy physics. Finally, we investigate the general ab-initio method for crystalline material based on quasi-classical U(1) lattice gauge theory (or QED based ab-initio). We design a simpler algorithm for fixing U(1) gauge when implementing Monte-Carlo sampling without introducing ghost field.</description>

      <title>A New Moir\'e Platform Based on M-Point Twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of moir\'e systems and materials based on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states at the M points of the Brillouin zone. These M-point moir\'e materials are fundamentally distinct from those derived from $\Gamma$- or K-point monolayers, featuring three time-reversal-preserving valleys related by three-fold rotational symmetry. We propose twisted bilayers of experimentally exfoliable 1T-SnSe$_2$ and 1T-ZrS$_2$ as realizations of this new class. Using extensive ab initio simulations, we develop quantitative continuum models and analytically show that the corresponding M-point moir\'e Hamiltonians exhibit emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries and a kagome plane-wave lattice in momentum space. This represents the first experimentally viable realization of a projective representation of crystalline space groups in a non-magnetic system. With interactions, these materials represent six-flavor Hubbard simulators with Mott physics, as can be seen by their flat Wilson loops. Furthermore, the presence of a non-symmorphic momentum-space in-plane mirror symmetry makes some of the M-point moir\'e Hamiltonians quasi-one-dimensional in each valley, suggesting the possibility of realizing Luttinger liquid physics. We predict the twist angles at which a series of (conduction) flat bands appear, provide a faithful continuum Hamiltonian, analyze its topology and charge density and briefly discuss several aspects of the physics of this new platform.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural network model for quantum impurity problems based on Lehmann representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) model to efficiently predict the self-energy of Anderson impurity models (AIMs) based on the Lehmann representation. As an example, we apply the PINN model to a single-orbital AIM (SAIM) for a noninteracting electron bath with a semicircular density of states. Trained across a wide range of onsite Coulomb interactions $U$ and hybridization strengths $V$, the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy in both $U$-$V$ and Matsubara-frequency spaces. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of physical constraints implemented in the PINN model. For example, We show that the Lehmann representation allows the PINN model to reduce the maximum test error in an electron filling by a factor of approximately 7.8.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling impurity solver based on quantics tensor cross interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods capable of handling nonequilibrium impurity models are essential for the study of transport problems and the solution of the nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) equations. In the strong correlation regime, the self-consistently resummed hybridization expansion is an appealing strategy, which however has been employed so far mainly in the lowest-order non-crossing approximation. At higher orders, standard implementations become numerically costly, but a potentially significant speed-up can be achieved by evaluating multi-dimensional integrals in an approximate factorized form. Here we develop a one-crossing approximation solver based on the recently introduced quantics tensor cross-interpolation, and demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency with applications to the Anderson impurity model and nonequilibrium steady-state DMFT calculations for the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Symmetry-Enriched Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noninvertible symmetry generalizes traditional group symmetries, advancing our understanding of quantum matter, especially one-dimensional gapped quantum systems. In critical lattice models, it is usually realized as emergent symmetries in the corresponding low-energy conformal field theories. In this work, we study critical lattice models with the noninvertible Rep($D_8$) symmetry in one dimension. This leads us to a new class of quantum critical points (QCP), noninvertible symmetry-enriched QCPs, as a generalization of known group symmetry-enriched QCPs. They are realized as phase transitions between one noninvertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase and another different one or spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase. We identify their low-energy properties and topological features through the Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) duality transformation. We argue that distinct noninvertible symmetry-enriched QCPs can not be smoothly connected without a phase transition or a multi-critical point.</description>

      <title>Fracton and topological order in the XY checkerboard toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the XY checkerboard toric code. It represents a generalization of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code with two types of star operators with $x$ and $y$ flavor and two anisotropic star sublattices forming a checkerboard lattice. The quantum phase diagram is deduced exactly by a duality transformation to two copies of self-dual Xu-Moore models, which builds on the existence of an sub-extensive number of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ conserved parities. For any spatial anisotropy of the star sublattices, the XY checkerboard toric code realizes two quantum phases with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order and an intermediate phase with type-I fracton order. The properties of the fracton phase like sub-extensive ground-state degeneracy can be analytically deduced from the degenerate limit of isolated stars. For the spatially isotropic case the extension of the fracton phase vanishes. The topological phase displays anyonic excitations with restricted mobility and dimensional reduction. All phase transitions are first order.</description>

      <title>Competing pair density wave orders in the square lattice $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, the competing orders in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates have been intensely studied, such as pseudogap phase, charge density waves (CDW), and pair density waves (PDW), which are thought to play a crucial role in high-temperature superconductivity. Using the $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice as the simplest model for high-$T_{c}$ cuprates, we employed the fermionic tensor product state (fTPS) method for numerical investigations. Our study revealed new types of PDW states alongside the well-known $d$-wave state and the recently discovered fluctuating PDW state within the low-energy subspace of the $t$-$J$ model. We believe that the competition among these states in the underdoped region suggests the potential existence of a fluctuating quantum liquid of PDW states, providing direct evidence for the pseudogap phase's "cheap vortex" scenario. Furthermore, we discuss the potential experimental implication of our discovery.</description>

      <title>Crystalline-equivalent topological phases of many-body fermionic systems in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore one-dimensional fermionic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases related by the crystalline equivalence principle. In particular, we study charge-conserving many-body topological phases of fermions protected respectively by chiral and reflection symmetries. While the classifications of the two crystalline-equivalent SPT phases are identical, their topological properties and phase structures can be very different, depending on the microscopic details. Specifically, we consider certain extensions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with and without interactions, that preserve both chiral and reflection symmetries, and explicitly compute the many-body topological invariants based on the systems' ground states. The phase structures determined by these topological invariants align perfectly with the many-body spectra of deformations among the models. As expected, gapped deformations exist only when all the topological invariants remain unchanged. Moreover, we show that decomposable systems -- those that can be decomposed into local and decoupled subsystems -- can be topologically characterized by real-space quantum numbers directly associated with the symmetries. For reflection-symmetric systems, these quantum numbers are related to the many-body topological invariants via a bulk-center correspondence, which can be justified using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence in generalized homology theory. Finally, we discuss the role of transition symmetry in the many-body topologies of these SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Connection between Free-Fermion and Interacting Crystalline Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for investigating the effects of interactions on crystalline symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Within this framework, one can establish a direct connection between the equivalence classes of free-fermion systems and their corresponding interacting classes. A central component of this framework is the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which provides a systematic way to represent crystalline SPT phases as SPT phases with internal symmetries on subspaces. We demonstrate the application of this approach through examples in various dimensions: 1d systems with U(1) and reflection symmetry, 2d systems with U(1) and C_{n} rotation symmetry, and 3d systems with U(1) and inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole gauge theory: anti-Higgs mechanism and elastic dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the duality between elasticity and fracton gauge theory, we study an extension of the gauge group that includes the quadrupole moment. Remarkably, we find that spontaneous breaking of the quadrupole symmetry increases the number of massless excitations. This result appears to challenge the well-established paradigm, according to which gauge fields acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are rendered massive. We refer to this phenomenon as the anti-Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, in the standard treatment of the fracton-elasticity duality, the conservation of quadrupole moment is incorporated ad hoc in order to restrict the motion of dislocations to glide along their Burgers vectors. Our study clarifies the origin of the quadrupole symmetry in the dual theory of elasticity, demonstrating that quadrupole gauge theory is not a priori dual to elastic solids but rather to a distinct class of systems, which we dub incompressible crystals. We argue, however, that the phenomenology of ordinary elasticity is recovered after the quadrupole symmetry is Higgsed and an incompressible crystal undergoes a phase transition to a compressible solid state.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous development of antiferromagnetism and local symmetry breaking in a kagome magnet (Co$_{0.45}$Fe$_{0.55}$)Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CoSn and FeSn, two kagome-lattice metals, have recently attracted significant attention as hosts of electronic flat bands and emergent physical properties. However, current understandings of their physical properties are limited to the knowledge of the average crystal structure. Here, we report the Fe-doping induced co-emergence of the antiferromagentic (AFM) order and local symmetry breaking in (Co0.45Fe0.55)Sn. Rietveld analysis on the neutron and synchrotron x-ray diffraction data indicates A-type antiferromagnetic order with the moment pointing perpendicular to the kagome layers, associated with the anomaly in the MSn(1)2Sn(2)4 (M = Co/Fe) octahedral distortion and the lattice constant c. Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling of the synchrotron x-ray total scattering results captured the subtle local orthorhombic distortion involving off-axis displacements of Sn2. Our results indicate that the stable hexagonal lattice above TN becomes unstable once the A-type AFM order is formed below TN. We argue that the local symmetry breaking has a magnetic origin and is driven by the out-of-plane magnetic exchange coupling. Our study provides comprehensive information on the crystal structure in both long-range scale and local scale, unveiling unique coupling between AFM order, octahedral distortion, and hidden local symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Haldane phase, field-induced magnetic ordering and Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior in a spin-one chain compound NiC$_2$O$_4$$\cdot$2NH$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed single-crystal magnetic susceptibility and $^1$H NMR measurements on a quasi-1D, spin-1 antiferromagnet NiC$_2$O$_4$$\cdot$2NH$_3$, with temperature down to 100 mK and with field up to 26 T. With field applied along the chain direction (crystalline $b$ direction), a spin gap is determined at low fields. Our susceptibility and spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal a Haldane phase at low field, with an intrachain exchange coupling $J$ $\approx$ 35 K and an easy-plane single-ion anisotropy of 17 K. A field-induced antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering emerges at fields of 2.1 T, which sets a three-dimensional (3D) quantum critical point (QCP). The high-temperature spin-lattice relaxation rates $1/T_1$ resolves an onset of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior at field above $3.5$ T, which characterizes a hidden 1D QCP.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics of the frustrated kagome compound Y-kapellasite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the magnetic ground states of frustrated antiferromagnets provides unique insight into the stability of quantum spin liquids, even if the anticipated state is not realized towards T = 0. Particularly relevant are structural modifications setting in at temperatures where the magnetic correlations come into play. Here we explore the lattice dynamics of Y-kapellasite (Y3Cu9(OH)19Cl8) single crystals by infrared spectroscopy in combination with ab initio calculations. We observe significant changes in the phonon spectra at Ts = 32 K, that gradually evolve down to low temperatures. The increase in the number of phonon modes provides evidence for a lowering of symmetry and we discuss several possibilities of crystal structure modifications. Our analysis also reveals that the structural variation involves exclusively H and O atoms, while the other atoms remain rather unaffected. An 8% red shift of the lowest-lying phonon mode upon cooling indicates strong magneto-elastic effects upon decoupling Cu-6f hexagons through the lattice vibrations.</description>

      <title>On polarons and dimerons in the two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional spin-up ideal Fermi gas interacting attractively with a spin-down impurity in the continuum undergoes, at zero temperature, a first-order phase transition from a polaron to a dimeron state. Here we study a similar system on a square lattice, by considering the attractive 2D Fermi-Hubbard model with a single spin-down and a finite filling fraction of spin-up fermions. We study polaron and dimeron quasi-particle properties via variational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation. Moreover, we develop a determinant diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm for this problem based on expansion in bare on-site coupling $U$. This algorithm turns out to be sign-problem free at any filling of spin-up fermions, allowing one to sample very high diagram order (larger than $200$ in our study) and to do simulations for large $U/t$ (we go up to $U/t=-20$ with $t$ the hopping strength). Both methods give qualitatively consistent results. With variational Ansatz we go to even larger on-site attraction. In contrast with the continuum case, we do not observe any polaron-to-dimeron transition for a range of spin-up filling fractions $\rho_{\uparrow}$ between $0.1$ and $0.4$. % (away from the low-filling limit). The polaron state always gives a lower energy and has a finite quasi-particle residue.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum critical phase from neural network wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) systems and models provide a versatile platform for emergent phenomena induced by strong electron correlation. In this work, we extend the newly developed real space neural network quantum Monte Carlo methods to study the quantum phase transition of electronic and magnetic properties. Hydrogen chains of different interatomic distances are explored systematically with both open and periodic boundary conditions, and fully correlated ground state many-body wavefunction is achieved via unsupervised training of neural networks. We demonstrate for the first time that neural networks are capable of capturing the quantum critical behavior of Tomonaga- Luttinger liquid (TLL), which is known to dominate 1D quantum systems. Moreover, we reveal the breakdown of TLL phase and the emergence of a Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by abrupt changes in the spin structure and the momentum distribution. Such behavior is absent in commonly studied 1D lattice models and is likely due to the involvement of high-energy orbitals of hydrogen atoms. Our work highlights the powerfulness of neural networks for representing complex quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic spin splitting above and below the Fermi level in a $g$-wave altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are distinguished by their unique spin group symmetries, where spin and spatial symmetries are fully decoupled, resulting in nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of electronic bands. This phenomenon, unlike conventional spin splitting driven by relativistic spin-orbit coupling, has transformative potential in fields such as spintronics, superconductivity and energy-efficient electronics. However, direct observation of NRSS is challenging due to presence of competing phases, low N\'eel temperatures, and the limitations of existing experimental probes to unambiguously capture the associated properties. Here, we integrate theoretical and experimental approaches to uncover NRSS in the intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoNb$_4$Se$_8$. Symmetry analysis, density functional theory (DFT), a novel Symmetry-Constrained Adaptive Basis (SCAB), and tight-binding modeling predict the presence of symmetry-enforced spin splitting, which we directly confirm using spin-ARPES for the occupied band structure and a newly developed technique, spin- and angle-resolved electron reflection spectroscopy (spin-ARRES), for the unoccupied states. Together, these complementary tools reveal alternating spin textures consistent with our predicted g-wave altermagnetic order and demonstrate the persistence of NRSS across a broad energy range. Crucially, temperature-dependent measurements show the suppression of NRSS at the N\'eel temperature ($T_N$), providing the first direct evidence of an altermagnetic phase transition. Residual spin splitting above $T_N$ suggests the coexistence of altermagnetic fluctuations and spin-orbit coupling effects, underscoring a complex interplay of mechanisms. By establishing CoNb$_4$Se$_8$ as a prototypical g-wave altermagnet, this work offers a robust framework for understanding NRSS, and lays the foundation for designing energy-efficient spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Continuous Collapse of the Spin Cycloid in BiFeO3 Thin Films under and Applied Magnetic Field probed by Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is one of the rare materials that exhibits multiferroic properties already at room-temperature. Therefore, it offers tremendous potential for future technological applications, such as memory and logic. However, a weak magnetoelectric coupling together with the presence of a noncollinear cycloidal spin order restricts various practical applications of BiFeO3. Therefore, there is a large interest in the search for suitable methods for the modulation of the spin cycloid in BiFeO3. By performing neutron diffraction experiments using a triple-axis instrument we have determined that the spin cycloid can be systematically suppressed by applying a high magnetic field of 10 T in a BiFeO3 thin film of about 100 nm grown on a (110)-oriented SrTiO3 substrate. As predicted by previous theoretical calculations, we observed that the required critical magnetic field to suppress the spin cycloid in a BiFeO3 thin film was lower as compared to the previously reported critical magnetic field for bulk BiFeO3 single crystals. Our experiment reveals that the spin cycloid continuously expands with increasing magnetic field before the complete transformation into a G-type antiferromagnetic spin order. Such tuning of the length of the spin cycloid up to a complete suppression offers new functionalities for future technological applications as in spintronics or magnonics.</description>

      <title>Controlling particle-hole symmetry of fractional quantum hall states in trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed experimental study of the particle-hole symmetry (PHS) of the Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states about half filling in a multiband system. Specifically, we focus on the lowest Landau level of the monolayer-like band of Bernal stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). In pristine TLG, the excitation energy gaps, Land\'e g-factor, effective mass, and disorder broadening of the FQH states are identical to their hole-conjugate counterpart. This precise PH symmetry stems from the lattice mirror symmetry that precludes Landau-level mixing. Introducing a non-zero displacement field \(D\) disrupts this mirror symmetry, facilitating the hybridization between the \(LL_{M}^{0}\) monolayer-like and \(LL_{B}^{2}\) bilayer-like Landau levels. This band hybridization eventually leads to a violation of the PHS of the FQH states. We find the one-third and two-fifth FQH states to be more robust against Landau level mixing than their hole-conjugate states, which agrees with theoretical predictions [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{113}, 086401 (2014)]. The Landau level mixing parameter $\kappa$ is found to increase sharply with $D$. We stress that the PHS breaking in TLG is of extrinsic origin and differs from the intrinsic, interaction-driven symmetry breaking observed in the lowest Landau levels of single-layer and bilayer graphene. Our research identifies an external factor that can manipulate the PHS in FQH states. Further probing this modulation may help experimentally differentiate between the composite fermion model and the Dirac composite fermion model [Phys. Rev. X \textbf{5}, 031027 (2015)].</description>

      <title>Effective temperature in approximate quantum many-body states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of numerically identifying the ground state of quantum many-body systems, approximate quantum wavefunction ansatzes are commonly employed. This study focuses on the spectral decomposition of these approximate quantum many-body states into exact eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian. The energy spectral decomposition could reflect the intricate physics at the interplay between quantum systems and numerical algorithms. Here we examine various parameterized wavefunction ansatzes constructed from neural networks, tensor networks, and quantum circuits, employing differentiable programming to numerically approximate ground states and imaginary-time evolved states. Our findings reveal a consistent exponential decay pattern in the spectral contributions of approximate quantum states across different ansatzes, optimization objectives, and quantum systems, characterized by small decay rates denoted as inverse effective temperatures. The effective temperature is related to ansatz expressiveness and accuracy and shows phase transition behaviors in learning imaginary-time evolved states. The universal picture and unique features suggest the significance and potential of the effective temperature in characterizing approximate quantum states.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the anisotropy of linear and nonlinear charge-spin conversion in Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Weyl semimetals, the nonlinear planar Hall effect (NPHE) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) are prominent manifestations of nonlinear and linear charge-spin conversion, respectively. However, simultaneous investigations of these phenomena within a single material system are scarce, limiting our understanding of their intrinsic connection and underlying mechanisms. Here, we report the first simultaneous observation of NPHE and SOT in a TaIrTe4/Py heterostructure. By employing harmonic Hall measurements and developing a magnetic field-dependent method, we successfully separated the contributions from NPHE, field-like SOT, and damping-like SOT, enabling accurate characterization of both linear and nonlinear charge-spin conversion properties. Our experiments revealed significant anisotropy along the [100] and [010] crystallographic directions of TaIrTe4, with stronger nonlinear responses and field-like SOT along the [100] direction, and larger damping-like SOT along the [010] direction. The distinct directional dependence of these phenomena provides new insights into the interplay between surface and bulk contributions to charge-spin conversion in Weyl semimetals. These findings enhance our understanding of anisotropic charge-spin conversion mechanisms in Weyl semimetals, which may inform future research and development of spintronic devices based on topological materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cellular Automata on Symmetric Subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum cellular automata (QCA) on one-dimensional spin systems defined over a subalgebra of the full local operator algebra - the symmetric subalgebra under a finite Abelian group symmetry $G$. For systems where each site carries a regular representation of $G$, we establish a complete classification of such subalgebra QCAs based on two topological invariants: (1) a surjective homomorphism from the group of subalgebra QCAs to the group of anyon permutation symmetries in a $(2+1)d$ $G$ gauge theory; and (2) a generalization of the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner (GNVW) index that characterizes the flow of the symmetric subalgebra. Specifically, two subalgebra QCAs correspond to the same anyon permutation and share the same index if and only if they differ by a finite-depth unitary circuit composed of $G$-symmetric local gates. We also identify a set of operations that generate all subalgebra QCAs through finite compositions. As an example, we examine the Kramers-Wannier duality on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric subalgebra, demonstrating that it maps to the $e$-$m$ permutation in the two-dimensional toric code and has an irrational index of $\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, it cannot be extended to a QCA over the full local operator algebra and mixes nontrivially with lattice translations.</description>

      <title>Fractons on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of edge excitations of fractonic systems in two dimensions, and elucidate their connections to bulk transport properties and quantum statistics of bulk excitations. The system we consider has immobile point charges, dipoles constrained to move only along lines perpendicular to their moment, and freely mobile quadrupoles and higher multipoles, realizing a bulk fractonic analog of fractional quantum Hall phases. We demonstrate that a quantized braiding phase between two bulk excitations is obtained only in two cases: when a point quadrupole braids around an immobile point charge, or when two non-orthogonal point dipoles braid with one another. The presence of a boundary edge in the system entails $\textit{two}$ types of gapless edge excitation modes, one that is fractonic with immobile charges and longitudinal dipoles, and a second non-fractonic mode consisting of transverse dipoles. We derive a novel current algebra of the fractonic edge modes. Further, investigating the effect of local edge-to-edge tunneling on these modes, we find that such a process is a relevant perturbation suggesting the possibility of edge deformation.</description>

      <title>Machine learning force-field model for kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of itinerant Ising magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning (ML) framework for large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of itinerant electron Ising systems. As the effective interactions between Ising spins in such itinerant magnets are mediated by conducting electrons, the calculation of energy change due to a local spin update requires solving an electronic structure problem. Such repeated electronic structure calculations could be overwhelmingly prohibitive for large systems. Assuming the locality principle, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed to directly predict the effective local field and the corresponding energy change associated with a given spin update based on Ising configuration in a finite neighborhood. As the kernel size of the CNN is fixed at a constant, the model can be directly scalable to kMC simulations of large lattices. Our approach is reminiscent of the ML force-field models widely used in first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Applying our ML framework to a square-lattice double-exchange Ising model, we uncover unusual coarsening of ferromagnetic domains at low temperatures. Our work highlights the potential of ML methods for large-scale modeling of similar itinerant systems with discrete dynamical variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum acoustic framework has recently emerged as a non-perturbative, coherent approach to electron-lattice interactions, uncovering rich physics often obscured by perturbative methods with incoherent scattering events. Here, we model the coupled dynamics of electrons and acoustic lattice vibrations within this framework, representing lattice vibrations as coherent states and electrons as quantum wavepackets. We derive and numerically implement electron backaction on the lattice, providing both visual and quantitative insights into electron wavepacket evolution, self-trapping, and the formation of small acoustic polarons. We investigate polaron binding energies across varying material parameters and compute key observables-including mean square displacement, kinetic energy, potential energy, and vibrational energy-over time. Our findings reveal the conditions that favor polaron formation, which is enhanced by low temperatures, high deformation potential constants, slow sound velocities, high effective masses, and small Fermi surfaces. Additionally, we explore the impact of external electric and magnetic fields, showing that while polaron formation remains robust under moderate fields, it is weakly suppressed at higher field strengths. These results deepen our understanding of polaron dynamics and pave the way for future studies into non-trivial transport behavior in quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: We map out the ground state phase diagram of the isotropic Kekule'-Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of the Heisenberg exchange couplings. Our study relies on large-scale tensor network simulations based on graph-based projected entangled pair state (gPEPS) approach in the thermodynamic limit. We find that on top of the quantum spin liquid (QSL) and conventional magnetically ordered phases which are typical of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, the Kekule'-Heisenberg phase diagram, hosts two plaquette valance bond solid (VBS) phases with vanishing magnetic order. While the VBS phases preserve the symmetries of the original Hamiltonian, they differ markedly from the Kitaev spin liquid by having decorated plaquette ordering which is distinguished by a plaquette order parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pseudogap phase of the cuprate, a thermal Hall response of neutral objects has been recently detected experimentally, which continuously persists into the antiferromagnetic insulating phase. In this work, we study the transport properties of neutral spinons as the elementary excitation of a doped Mott insulator, which is governed by a mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. We show that such a chiral spinon as a composite of an $S=1/2$ spin sitting at the core of a supercurrent vortex, can contribute to the thermal Hall effect, thermopower, and Hall effect due to its intrinsic transverse (cyclotron) motion under internal fictitious fluxes. In particular, the magnitudes of the transport coefficients are phenomenologically determined by two basic parameters: the doping concentration and $T_c$, quantitatively consistent with the experimental measurements including the signs and qualitative temperature and magnetic field dependence. Combined with the predictions of the spinon longitudinal transport properties, including the Nernst and spin Hall effects, a phenomenological description of the pseudogap phase is established as characterized by the neutral spinon excitations, which eventually become "confined" with an intrinsic superconducting transition at $T_c$. Finally, within this theoretical framework, the "order to order" phase transition between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic insulating phases are briefly discussed, with the thermal Hall monotonically increasing into the latter.</description>

      <title>Transformer Wave Function for two dimensional frustrated magnets: emergence of a Spin-Liquid Phase in the Shastry-Sutherland Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding quantum magnetism in two-dimensional systems represents a lively branch in modern condensed-matter physics. In the presence of competing super-exchange couplings, magnetic order is frustrated and can be suppressed down to zero temperature. Still, capturing the correct nature of the exact ground state is a highly complicated task, since energy gaps in the spectrum may be very small and states with different physical properties may have competing energies. Here, we introduce a variational Ansatz for two-dimensional frustrated magnets by leveraging the power of representation learning. The key idea is to use a particular deep neural network with real-valued parameters, a so-called Transformer, to map physical spin configurations into a high-dimensional feature space. Within this abstract space, the determination of the ground-state properties is simplified and requires only a shallow output layer with complex-valued parameters. We illustrate the efficacy of this variational Ansatz by studying the ground-state phase diagram of the Shastry-Sutherland model, which captures the low-temperature behavior of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ with its intriguing properties. With highly accurate numerical simulations, we provide strong evidence for the stabilization of a spin-liquid between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic phases. In addition, a direct calculation of the triplet excitation at the $\Gamma$ point provides compelling evidence for a gapless spin liquid. Our findings underscore the potential of Neural-Network Quantum States as a valuable tool for probing uncharted phases of matter, and open up new possibilities for establishing the properties of many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$ that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of $d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d&gt;1$. The anomaly-nonseparability connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in $d=1$ we found an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also analyze mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly. We find that, while strong-weak mixed anomaly in general does not constrain quantum entanglement, it does constrain long-range correlations of mixed states in nontrivial ways. Namely, such states are not symmetrically invertible and not gapped Markovian, generalizing familiar properties of anomalous pure states.</description>

Abstract: Strong correlations in matter promote a landscape of quantum phases and associated quantum critical points. For metallic systems, there is increasing recognition that the quantum criticality goes beyond the Landau framework and, thus, novel means are needed to characterize the quantum critical fluid. Here we do so by studying an entanglement quantity, the quantum Fisher information, in a strange metal system, focusing on the exemplary case of an Anderson/Kondo lattice model near its Kondo destruction quantum critical point. The spin quantum Fisher information peaks at the quantum critical point and indicates a strongly entangled ground state. Our results are supported by the quantum Fisher information extracted from inelastic neutron scattering measurements in heavy fermion metals. Our work elucidates the loss of quasiparticles in strange metals, opens a quantum information avenue to advance the understanding of metallic quantum criticality in a broad range of strongly correlated systems, and points to a novel regime of quantum matter to realize amplified entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic properties of $S=1$ antiferromagnetic diamond lattice, Ni$X_{2}$(pyrimidine)$_{2}$ ($X$ = Cl, Br), hosting a single-ion anisotropy (SIA) orientation which alternates between neighbouring sites. Through neutron diffraction measurements of the $X$ = Cl compound, the ordered state spins are found to align collinearly along a pseudo-easy-axis, a unique direction created by the intersection of two easy planes. Similarities in the magnetization, exhibiting spin-flop transitions, and the magnetic susceptibility in the two compounds imply that the same magnetic structure and a pseudo-easy-axis is also present for $X$ = Br. We estimate the Hamiltonian parameters by combining analytical calculations and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of the spin-flop and saturation field. The MC simulations also reveal that the spin-flop transition occurs when the applied field is parallel to the pseudo-easy-axis. Contrary to conventional easy-axis systems, there exist field directions perpendicular to the pseudo-easy-axis for which the magnetic saturation is approached asymptotically and no symmetry-breaking phase transition is observed at finite fields.</description>

      <title>Universal Planckian relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major puzzle in understanding the high-Tc is the microscopic origin of the linear-in-temperature (T-linear) resistivity in the strange metal state, extending to very high temperatures. Existing theoretical discussions imply a universal "Planckian" relaxation rate, i.e., independent of doping. However, the slope of the T-linear resistivity itself is strongly doping dependent. Here, we show that a universal Planckian relaxation rate can be reconciled with the observed transport behavior if the effective mass scales inversely with the doping, 1/p, over the entire doping range, as proposed by Anderson [P. W. Anderson, Science 235, 1196 (1987)] in the context of doped Mott insulators. The 1/p mass scaling is also directly observed in the behavior of the entropy in the overdoped cuprates. This implies that while the 1/p mass scaling in the cuprates is the consequence of strong short-range repulsive interactions, the relaxation rate itself is an emergent property of different physical origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat band (FB) systems, featuring dispersionless energy bands, have garnered significant interest due to their compact localized states (CLSs). However, a detailed account on how local impurities affect the physical properties of overlapping CLSs is still missing. Here we study a diamond chain with a finite magnetic flux per plaquette that exhibits a gapped midspectrum FB with non-orthogonal CLSs, and develop a framework for projecting operators onto such non-orthogonal bases. This framework is applied to the case of an open diamond chain with small local impurities in the midchain plaquette, and analytical expressions are derived for FB states influenced by these impurities. For equal impurities in top and bottom sites under diagonal disorder, we show how the impurity states experience an averaged disorder dependent on their spatial extension, leading to enhanced robustness against disorder. For a single impurity, an exotic topological phase with a half-integer winding number is discovered, which is linked to a single in-gap edge state under open boundary conditions. Numerical simulations validate the analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of a staggered $S=1$ chain Ni(pym)(H$_{2}$O)$_{2}$(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$ with an alternating single-ion anisotropy direction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials composed of spin-1 antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains are known to adopt complex ground states which are sensitive to the single-ion-anisotropy (SIA) energy ($D$), and intrachain ($J_{0}$) and interchain ($J'_{i}$) exchange energy scales. While theoretical and experimental studies have extended this model to include various other energy scales, the effect of the lack of a common SIA axis is not well explored. Here we investigate the magnetic properties of Ni(pyrimidine)(H$_{2}$O)$_{2}$(NO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, a chain compound where the tilting of Ni octahedra leads to a 2-fold alternation of the easy-axis directions along the chain. Muon-spin relaxation measurements indicate a transition to long-range order at $T_{\text{N}}=2.3$\,K and the magnetic structure is initially determined to be antiferromagnetic and collinear using elastic neutron diffraction experiments. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were used to find $J_{0} = 5.107(7)$\,K, $D = 2.79(1)$\,K, $J'_{2}=0.18(3)$\,K and a rhombic anisotropy energy $E=0.19(9)$\,K. Mean-field modelling reveals that the ground state structure hosts spin canting of $\phi\approx6.5^{\circ}$, which is not detectable above the noise floor of the elastic neutron diffraction data. Monte-Carlo simulation of the powder-averaged magnetization, $M(H)$, is then used to confirm these Hamiltonian parameters, while single-crystal $M(H)$ simulations provide insight into features observed in the data.</description>

      <title>Ternary nickel hydrides: a new platform for unconventional superconductivity and quantum magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose ternary nickel hydrides MNiH2 (M = Li, Na) as new materials that mimic cuprate physics but have important differences and interesting properties. Ni-H bands are wider than in oxides due to shorter bond lengths and covalency is larger than in Ni oxides which leads to a large scale of magnetic interactions. The charge transfer energy is smaller than in LaNiO2 which in cuprates translates to a larger Tc. We notice the formation of the electride band close to the Fermi surface which appears due to H vacancy along the c lattice vector. The considerable difference with cuprates arises from dz2 orbitals hybridization with interstitial orbitals allowing charge transfer to an apical vacancy state and self-doping the cuprate like Ni dx2-y2 H s antibonding bands which suggests that stoichiometric NaNiH2 may already be metallic and superconducting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the challenging problem of identifying the quantum spin liquid candidate in the spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. By integrating the Gutzwiller-guided density matrix renormalization group method with analytical analyses, we present clear evidence that the ground state is a Z$_2$ Dirac spin liquid. This state can be efficiently described by a Gutzwiller-projected parton theory characterized by its projective symmetry group. To distinguish the difference between the projected Z$_2$ and U(1) parton state, we investigate the chiral spin liquid ground states as topological orders by incorporating a $J_\chi$ term into the $J_1$-$J_2$ model and observe a transition from a Z$_2$ chiral spin liquid to a U(1)$_2$ chiral spin liquid as $J_\chi$ increases.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical calculations show that twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) under a transverse electric field develops a valley Chern number 2 at charge neutrality. Using thermodynamic and thermal activation measurements we report the experimental observation of a universal closing of the charge neutrality gap in the Hofstadter spectrum of TDBG at 1/2 magnetic flux per unit cell, in agreement with theoretical predictions for a valley Chern number 2 gap. Our theoretical analysis of the experimental data shows that the interaction energy, while larger than the flat-band bandwidth in TDBG near 1\deg does not alter the emergent valley symmetry or the single-particle band topology.</description>

Abstract: We study the coexistence of superconductivity (SC) and density-wave state and reconcile various puzzling experimental data in organic superconductors (TMTSF)$_{2}$PF$_{6}$ and (TMTSF)$_{2}$ClO$_{4}$. The anisotropic resistance drop above $T_c$ is qualitatively described by nascent isolated SC islands within a bulk analytical model. However, the observed anisotropic SC onset is explained only when the finite size and flat needle shape of samples is considered. Our results pave a way to estimate the volume fraction and the typical size of SC islands in far from the sample surface, and apply to many inhomogeneous superconductors, including high-$T_c$ cuprate or Fe-based ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.06872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of tensor network based machine learning methods to scale to large image and text data sets. For that, we study how the mutual information between a subregion and its complement scales with the subsystem size $L$, similarly to how it is done in quantum many-body physics. We find that for text, the mutual information scales as a power law $L^\nu$ with a close to volume law exponent, indicating that text cannot be efficiently described by 1D tensor networks. For images, the scaling is close to an area law, hinting at 2D tensor networks such as PEPS could have an adequate expressibility. For the numerical analysis, we introduce a mutual information estimator based on autoregressive networks, and we also use convolutional neural networks in a neural estimator method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.03605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss under which conditions multipartite entanglement in mixed quantum states can be characterized only in terms of two-point connected correlation functions, as it is the case for pure states. In turn, the latter correlations are defined via a suitable combination of (disconnected) one- and two-point correlation functions. In contrast to the case of pure states, conditions to be satisfied turn out to be rather severe. However, we were able to identify some interesting cases, as when the point-independence is valid of the one-point correlations in each possible decomposition of the density matrix, or when the operators that enter in the correlations are (semi-)positive/negative defined.</description>

      <title>Problem-tailored Simulation of Energy Transport on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Sierpinski gasket (triangle) and carpet (square) lattices as examples, we theoretically study the properties of fractal superconductors. For that, we focus on the phenomenon of $s$-wave superconductivity in the Hubbard model with attractive on-site potential and employ the Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach and the theory of superfluid stiffness. For the case of the Sierpinski gasket, we demonstrate that fractal geometry of the underlying crystalline lattice can be strongly beneficial for superconductivity, not only leading to a considerable increase of the critical temperature $T_c$ as compared to the regular triangular lattice but also supporting macroscopic phase coherence of the Cooper pairs. In contrast, the Sierpinski carpet geometry does not lead to pronounced effects, and we find no substantial difference as compared with the regular square lattice. We conjecture that the qualitative difference between these cases is caused by different ramification properties of the fractals.</description>

      <title>Faster randomized partial trace estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop randomized matrix-free algorithms for estimating partial traces, a generalization of the trace arising in quantum physics and chemistry. Our algorithm improves on the typicality-based approach used in [T. Chen and Y-C. Cheng, \emph{Numerical computation of the equilibrium-reduced density matrix for strongly coupled open quantum systems}, J. Chem. Phys. 157, 064106 (2022)] by deflating important subspaces (e.g. corresponding to the low-energy eigenstates) explicitly. This results in a significant variance reduction, leading to several order-of-magnitude speedups over the previous state of the art. We then apply our algorithm to study the thermodynamics of several Heisenberg spin systems, particularly the entanglement spectrum and ergotropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum frustrated Wigner chains</title>

Abstract: A Wigner chain in a periodic potential is a paradigmatic example of geometric frustration with long-range interactions. The dynamics emulates the Frenkel-Kontorova model with Coulomb interactions. In the continuum approximation, dislocations are sine-Gordon solitons with power-law decaying tails. We show that their action is mapped into a massive, long-range (1+1) Thirring model, where the solitons are charged fermionic excitations over an effective Dirac sea. We identify the corresponding mean field theory and show that the Coulomb interactions destabilize structures commensurate with the periodic substrate, suppressing their onset and giving rise to {\it interaction-induced} lubrication. Our study identifies the role of long-range interactions on determining nanofriction. Our predictions can be probed in state-of-the-art trapped ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Critical analysis of multiple reentrant localization in an antiferromagnetic helix with transverse electric field: Hopping dimerization-free scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional substitutional disorder. We conduct a finite-size scaling analysis on the observed reentrant phases to identify critical points, determine associated critical exponents, and examine the scaling behavior linked to localization transitions. Additionally, we explore the parameter space to identify the conditions under which the reentrant phases occur. Described within a tight-binding framework, present work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry. Potential applications and experimental realizations of RL phenomena are also explored.</description>

      <title>Fractal ground state of ion chains in periodic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions in a periodic potential are a paradigm of a frustrated Wigner crystal. The dynamics is captured by a long-range Frenkel-Kontorova model. The classical ground state can be mapped to the one of an antiferromagnetic spin chain with long-range interactions in a magnetic field, whose strength is determined by the mismatch between chain's and substrate lattice's periodicity. The mapping is exact when the substrate potential is a piecewise harmonic potential and holds for any two-body interaction decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ with the distance $r$. The ground state is a devil's staircase of regular, periodic structures as a function of the mismatch, whose range of stability depends also on the coefficient $\alpha$. While the staircase is well defined in the thermodynamic limit for $\alpha&gt;1$, for Coulomb interactions, $\alpha=1$, it disappears and the sliding-to-pinned transitions becomes crossovers. However, due to the logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit characteristic of the Coulomb potential, the staircase is found for any finite number of ions. We discuss the experimental parameters as well as the features that allow one to observe and reveal our predictions in experimental platforms. These dynamics are a showcase of the versatility of trapped ion platforms for exploring the interplay between frustration and interactions.</description>
