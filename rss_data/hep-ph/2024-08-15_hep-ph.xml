      <title>Are in-medium quark-gluon showers strongly coupled? Results in the large-$N_f$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inside a medium, showers originating from a very high energy particle develop via medium-induced splitting processes such as bremsstrahlung and pair production. During shower development, two consecutive splittings sometimes overlap quantum mechanically, so that they cannot be treated independently. Some of these effects can be absorbed into an effective value of a medium parameter known as $\hat q$. Previous calculations (with certain simplifying assumptions) have found that, after adjusting the value of $\hat q$, the leftover effect of overlapping splittings is quite small for purely gluonic large-$N_c$ showers but is very much larger for large-$N_f$ QED showers, at comparable values of $N\alpha$. Here, by investigating the same problem for QCD with *quarks* in the large-$N_f$ limit of many quark flavors, we make a first study of whether the small effect in purely gluonic showers (i) was merely an accident or (ii) is more broadly characteristic of such overlap effects in QCD. We also offer a qualitative explanation for the large size of the effect in QED vs. QCD.</description>

      <title>Search for baryon junctions in e+A collisions at the Electron Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constituent quarks in a nucleon are the essential elements in the standard ``quark model" associated with the electric charge, spin, mass, and baryon number of a nucleon. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes nucleon as a composite object containing current quarks (valence quarks and sea (anti-)quarks) and gluons. These subatomic elements and their interactions are known to contribute in complex ways to the overall nucleon spin and mass. In the early development of QCD theory in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis postulated that the baryon number might manifest itself through a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields forming a Y-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. In this work, we propose to test such hypothesis by measuring (i) the Regge intercept of the net-baryon distributions for $e$+($p$)Au collisions, (ii) baryon and charge transport in the isobaric ratio between $e$+Ru and $e$+Zr collisions, and (iii) target flavor dependence of proton and antiproton yields at large rapidity, transported from the hydrogen and deuterium targets in $e+p$(d) collisions. Our study indicates that these measurements at the EIC can help determine what carries the baryon number.</description>

      <title>Dihadron azimuthal asymmetry and light-quark dipole moments at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe light-quark dipole moments by examining the azimuthal asymmetries between a collinear pair of hadrons in semi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering off an unpolarized proton target at the Electron-Ion Collider. These asymmetries provide a means to observe transversely polarized quarks, which arise exclusively from the interference between the dipole and the Standard Model interactions, thereby depending linearly on the dipole couplings. We demonstrate that this novel approach can enhance current constraints on light-quark dipole operators by an order of magnitude, free from contamination of other new physics effects. Furthermore, it allows for a simultaneous determination of both the real and imaginary parts of the dipole couplings, offering a new avenue for investigating potential $CP$-violating effects at high energies.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Twist-3 Chiral-Even GPDs in the Light-Front Quark-Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in this study by computing chiral-even generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at twist-$3$ using the light-front quark-diquark model (LFQDM), particularly when the longitudinal momentum transfer is zero. We provide a detailed analysis of the twist-$3$ chiral-even GPD's dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction ($x$) and the momentum transfer ($t$) by illustrating their behavior through extensive two-dimensional ($2$-D) and three-dimensional ($3$-D) visualizations. Our investigation also reveals the intricate relationships between these GPDs and other distribution functions (DFs) such as generalized transverse-momentum dependent distributions (GTMDs), transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs), and parton distribution functions (PDFs). Our study also includes the connected form factors (FFs) which are crucial in understanding the internal structure of hadrons. Additionally, we provide impact parameter GPD plots to offer insights into the spatial distribution of partons.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions for low-lying octet baryons with non-zero skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed the structural analysis of low-lying octet baryon members by assuming charge-isospin symmetry among quark flavors in transverse and longitudinal space. Using the light-cone spectator diquark model, we have investigated the electromagnetic form factors of the octet baryons and have compared them with the available data. Model scale has been estimated by comparing the valence $u$ quark's parton distribution function (PDF) of proton with the result of CTEQ5L parameterization. A comparative analysis of PDFs and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for non-zero skewness among octet baryons has also been demonstrated. Fourier transform of the deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitude with respect to skewness has been further applied to study the diffraction patterns in the boost-invariant longitudinal position space.</description>

      <title>Polarization Measurements as a Probe of Axion-Photon Coupling: a Study of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion Like Particles (ALPs) can be produced in Gamma Ray Bursts, altering the polarization of the electromagnetic emission in these events. For the first time, we derive bounds on the axion-photon coupling from polarization measurements of GRB 221009A, performing a full calculation of the Stokes parameters, as it is typically done in the astrophysics community. Within astrophysical uncertainties, our limits on the axion-photon coupling are competitive with complementary probes in the axion mass range $10^{-9}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-8}$ eV, further allowing to probe motivated parameter space of ALP dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing a light long-lived pseudo-scalar from Higgs decay via displaced taus at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A light (GeV mass) long-lived ($c\tau$ around dozens of millimeters) CP-odd scalar can be readily predicted in new physics models. In this work we investigate the Higgs decay into such a light scalar plus a $Z$-boson and take the aligned two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) as an example. This light long-lived scalar, with the dominant decay to tau leptons, will fly over a distance from the production point and present a displaced vertex in an Inner Detector of a generally purposed experiment like ATLAS or CMS. In our study we focus on the LHC experiment and perform Monte Carlo simulations for the signal and backgrounds. We demonstrate some benchmark points for the aligned 2HDM and find the signal to be detectable when the luminosity is accumulated to 300 fb$^{-1}$. So our study suggests an experimental search for this process in the ongoing LHC.</description>

      <title>An FONLL prescription with coexisting flavor number PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new prescription to account for heavy quark mass effects in the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) based on the FONLL scheme. Our prescription makes explicit use of the freedom to choose the number of active flavors at a given scale and, thus, use coexisting PDFs with different active flavor number. This new prescription is perturbatively equivalent to the former but improves the implementation in two ways. First, it can be naturally generalized to account simultaneously for multiple heavy quark effects, such as charm and bottom effects, which can both be relevant at the same scale due to the small mass difference. Second, it can be trivially generalized to use at any fixed-order or collinear resummed accuracy, while previous prescriptions required ad-hoc expansions of the DGLAP evolution kernels for each coefficient. We supplement the paper with codes for the computation of deep inelastic scattering observables in this new prescription.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Without adhering to any specific model, we have presented 4 X 4 quark mixing matrix as an extension of the 3 X 3 PDG parametrization of the CKM matrix. Using unitarity constraints as well as the hierarchy among the elements of the 3 X 3 CKM matrix, we have found the hierarchy among the 4th row and 4th column elements of the 4 X 4 quark mixing matrix. Further, for the fourth generation case, we have explicitly found the 9 independent rephasing invariant parameters J_4X4. Also, using phenomenological estimates of the 4th row and 4th column elements, we have numerically evaluated these 9 parameters.</description>

      <title>Emergence of New Systematics for Open Charm Production in High Energy Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the production systematics of open charm hadron yields in high-energy collisions and their description based on the Statistical Hadronization Model. The rapidity density of $D^0, D^+, D^{*+}, D_s^+$ mesons and $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons in heavy ion and proton-proton collisions is analyzed for different collision energies and centralities. The Statistical Hadronization Model is extended to open charm production in minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions. In this context, we use the link established in [1], see also the further development in [2], between the rapidity density of open charm hadron yields, $dN_i/dy$, and the rapidity density of charm-anticharm quark pairs, $dN_{c\bar c}/d\eta$ to demonstrate that, in pp, pA and AA collisions, $dN_i/dy$ scales in leading order with $dN_{c\bar c}/d\eta$ and the slope coefficient is quantified by the appropriate thermal density ratio calculated at the chiral crossover temperature, $T_c=156.5$ MeV. It is also shown that, in high energy collisions and within uncertainties, $dN_i/dy$ exhibits the power-law scaling with the charged-particle pseudo-rapidity density. Furthermore, presently available data on different ratios of open charm rapidity densities in high-energy collisions are independent of collision energy and system size, as expected in the Statistical Hadronization Model.</description>

      <title>TeV scale Leptogenesis with triplet Fermion in Connection to Muon $g-2$ and W mass anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose extending the minimal scotogenic model with a triplet fermion and a singlet scalar. All the fields change non-trivially under an additional $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry. The $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry allows only diagonal Yukawa couplings among different generations of SM leptons and right-handed singlet neutrinos. The one-loop radiative diagrams generate neutrino mass. The Yukawa coupling of the triplet fermion with the inert doublet positively contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry forbids the conventional leptogenesis from the right-handed neutrino decay. A net lepton asymmetry can be generated in the muonic sector from triplet fermion decay. Involvement of the Yukawa coupling both in leptogenesis and in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon results in a strong correlation between leptogenesis and the recent Fermi lab result. We show a viable parameter space for TeV scale leptogenesis while explaining the Fermi lab results. The inert scalar is the dark matter candidate in this model. The model also poses the potential to explain the latest results on W boson mass from the CDF-II experiment.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory of Weyl Group and its Interpretation as Weyl Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an extensive description of Weyl quadratic gravity as the gauge theory of the Weyl group. The previously discovered (vectorial) torsion/non-metricity equivalence is shown to be built-in as it corresponds to a redefinition of the generators of the Weyl group. We present a generalisation of the torsion/non-metricity duality which includes, aside from the vector, also a traceless 3-tensor with two antisymmetric indices and vanishing skew symmetric part. A discussion of this relation in the case of minimally coupled matter fields is given. We further point out that a Rarita-Schwinger field can couple minimally to all the components of torsion and some components of non-metricity. Alongside we present the same gauge construction for the Poincar\'e and conformal groups. We show that even though the Weyl group is a subgroup of the conformal group, the gauge theory of the latter is actually only a special case of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity from Weyl conformal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids long-held criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: Weyl gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to Einstein-Hilbert gravity (Riemannian geometry) respectively, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical Weyl gauge boson and is Weyl-anomaly free; all fields and masses have geometric origin, with no added scalar compensators; the theory is the leading order of a Weyl gauge invariant DBI action of conformal geometry that gives a natural analytical continuation of the former to $d$ dimensions; Weyl anomaly is recovered in the broken phase; in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity and Riemannian geometry; SM has a natural embedding in Weyl conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with a successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry alone generates a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, leading to a unified description by the gauge principle of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM.</description>

      <title>UHECR Clustering: Lightest Nuclei from Local Sheet Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) puzzle is reviewed under the hints of a few basic results: clustering, anisotropy, asymmetry, bending, and composition changes with energies. We show how the lightest UHECR nuclei from the nearest AGN or Star-Burst sources, located inside a few Mpc Local Sheets, may explain, at best, the observed clustering of Hot Spots at tens EeV energy. Among the possible local extragalactic candidate sources, we derived the main contribution of very few galactic sources. These are located in the Local Sheet plane within a distance of a few Mpc, ejecting UHECR at a few tens of EeV energy. UHECR also shine at lower energies of several EeV, partially feeding the Auger dipole by LMC and possibly a few nearer galactic sources. For the very recent highest energy UHECR event, if a nucleon, it may be explained by a model based on the scattering of UHE ZeV neutrinos on low-mass relic neutrinos. Such scatterings are capable of correlating, via Z boson resonance, the most distant cosmic sources above the GZK bound with such an enigmatic UHECR event. Otherwise, these extreme events, if made by the heaviest composition, could originate from the largest bending trajectory of heaviest nuclei or from nearby sources, even galactic ones. In summary, the present lightest to heavy nuclei model UHECR from the Local Sheet could successfully correlate UHECR clustering with the nearest galaxies and AGN. Heavy UHECR may shine by being widely deflected from the Local Sheet or from past galactic, GRB, or SGR explosive ejection.</description>

      <title>Pions valence quark distributions in asymmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have calculated the valence quark distributions of the lightest pseudoscalar meson, pions, in the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero and finite temperature employing a light-cone quark model. The medium modifications in the pion properties have been stimulated through the effective quark masses computed using the chiral SU($3$) quark mean field model. We have primarily focused on the impact of isospin asymmetric medium on the distribution amplitudes (DAs) and parton distribution functions (PDFs) of a valence quark for different baryon density and temperature values. Also, the DAs and PDFs have been evolved to $Q^2=10$ GeV$^2$ and $Q^2=16$ GeV$^2$ for different densities of nuclear medium and results have been compared with the available experimental data. The DAs and PDFs are found to modify substantially as a function of baryon density as compared to temperature and isospin asymmetry of the medium.</description>

      <title>Correlators for pseudo Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-Hermitian system is a class of non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian satisfying the condition $\eta^{-1}H^\dagger\eta=H$. We develop the in-in and Schwinger Keldysh formalism to calculate cosmological correlators for pseudo-Hermitian systems. We study a model consists of massive symplectic fermions coupled to the primordial curvature perturbation. The three-point function for the primordial curvature perturbation is computed up to one-loop and compared to earlier work where the loop correction comes from a massive scalar boson. The two results differ by a minus sign. Therefore, the one loop correction to the three-point function cannot be used to distinguished scalar bosons and symplectic fermions. To conclude, we discuss possibilities where the scalar bosons and symplectic fermions may be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Electroweak $\eta_w$ meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Standard Model is accompanied by a new pseudo-scalar degree of freedom, $\eta_w$-meson, which cancels the topological susceptibility of the electroweak vacuum and gets its mass from this effect. The prediction is based on the analyticity properties of the Chern-Simons correlator combined with the basic features of gravity. Depending on the quality-level of the $U(1)_{B+L}$-symmetry, $\eta_w$ emerges as a $B+L$ pseudo-Goldstone boson or as a St\"uckelberg $2$-form of the electroweak gauge redundancy. An intriguing scenario of the first category is the emergence of $\eta_w$ in the form of the phase of a $U(1)_{B+L}$-violating fermion condensate triggered by the instantons, somewhat similarly to $\eta'$-meson in QCD. Regardless of its particular origin, the presence of $\eta_w$-meson in the theory appears to be a matter of consistency.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls in three spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls using fully three-dimensional numerical simulations. We consider two different scenarios: first, the classical stability of gauged Q-balls with respect to generic three-dimensional perturbations, and second, the behaviour of gauged Q-balls during head-on and off-axis collisions at relativistic velocities. With regards to stability, we find that there exist gauged Q-ball configurations which are classically stable in both logarithmic and polynomial scalar field models. With regards to relativistic collisions, we find that the dynamics can depend on many different parameters such as the collision velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and impact parameter of the colliding Q-balls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This set of notes was designed to accompany two hours of lectures and practical exercises at the New Horizons for Psi workshop in Lisbon in July 2024 entitled "Studying fundamental fields with numerical relativity". Numerical relativity is a tool used to help understand the behaviours of metric and matter fields in dynamical, strong gravity situations. It has been used to study a range of situations involving fundamental fields, including superradiance, modified gravity, dynamical friction, dark matter accretion and early universe cosmology. The purpose of this course is to provide some background and hands-on experience in numerical relativity that will help students to better understand the possibilities provided by this tool, as well as its limitations.</description>

      <title>A study of bound states of $\eta, \eta^{'}, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}$, $B^{0}$, $\bar{B^{0}}$, $\bar{K^{0}}$ and $\phi$ mesons with light and heavy nuclei within chiral SU(3) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the possibilities of the formation of bound states of neutral pseudoscalar mesons $\eta, \eta^{'}, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}, B^{0}, \bar{B^{0}}$ and $\bar{K^{0}}$ and the vector meson $\phi$, with the nuclei $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb, calculating their binding energy and absorption decay width. To calculate the optical potentials of these mesons in different nuclei under study, we shall use the chiral SU(3) hadronic mean field model, in which the properties of nucleons in the medium are modified through the scalar isoscalar fields $\sigma$ and $\zeta$ and the scalar-isovector field $\delta$. The scalar-isovector field $\delta$ account for the finite isospin asymmetry of different nuclei having asymmetry in number of protons and neutrons. The binding energy and absorption decay width of mesons are calculated for the ground state and some of possible excited states of the nuclei. In the chiral SU(3) model, the mesons $ \eta, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}, B^{0}, \bar{B^{0}}$ and $\bar{K^{0}}$ are observed to have significant negative mass shift upto nuclear saturation density which lead to the possibility of the bound states at least for ground states and some of excited states in case of heavy nuclei. For the pseudoscalar singlet $\eta^{'}$ and the vector meson $\phi$ the mass shift obtained are found to be small and bound states are not formed. The present calculations are compared with different studies available in the field and will be useful in understanding the outcomes from different experimental facilities focusing on this area of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the light of recent measurement of muon $(g-2)$, we investigate the phenomenological implications of an axion-like particle (ALP) which only couples to the standard model charged leptons. We find that in a narrow mass range of ALP, it can alleviate the tension between the theoretical prediction and experimental observation of $(g-2)_\mu$ once we consider all possible one and two-loop diagrams. In particular, ALP can either explain the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly for $5\,{\rm GeV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 6 \,{\rm GeV}$ while satisfying the other experimental constraints, or be restricted by it.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectrum and rearrangement decays of S-wave $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states in a simplified quark model. The masses and widths are estimated by assuming that the $X(4140)$ is the lower $1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. Comparing our results with experimental measurements, we find that the recently observed $X(3960)$ by LHCb can be assigned as the lowest $0^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state and the $X_0(4140)$ could be the second lowest $0^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. Predictions of ratios between partial widths for the involved tetraquarks are given. We call for searches for more $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquarks with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$, $0^{++}$, and $2^{++}$.</description>

      <title>Charmonium states in a coupled-channel model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the mass spectrum and two-body open-charm strong decays of charmonium states in a coupled-channel model where the $^3P_0$ quark-antiquark pair creation mechanism is employed. The results of masses, mass shifts, proportions of the $c\bar{c}$ component, and open-charm decay widths are provided. The $S$-$D$ wave mixing angles and di-electric decay widths for vector mesons are also presented. Based on our results, we find that the $\psi(3770)$, $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $\psi(4360)$, and $\psi(4415)$ can be assigned as the $1^3D_1$-, $3^3S_1$-, $2^3D_1$-, $4^3S_1$-, and $3^3D_1$-dominated charmonium states, respectively. The $\psi_3(3842)$ is a good candidate of the $\psi_3(1D)$ charmonium state. The calculated mass and strong decay width of $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ with significant continuum contribution ($\sim$57\%) favor the charmonium interpretation for the mysterious $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. When considering the large uncertainty in the observed decay width, the possibility to assign the $\chi_{c0}(3860)$ as the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ charmonium state cannot be ruled out. One may describe well the properties of $\chi_{c2}(3930)$ with the $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ charmonium. The predictions on properties of other $c\bar{c}$ states can be tested by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing short-lived particles using hypergraph representation learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In collider experiments, the kinematic reconstruction of heavy, short-lived particles is vital for precision tests of the Standard Model and in searches for physics beyond it. Performing kinematic reconstruction in collider events with many final-state jets, such as the all-hadronic decay of top-antitop quark pairs, is challenging. We present HyPER: Hypergraph for Particle Event Reconstruction, a novel architecture based on graph neural networks that uses hypergraph representation learning to build more powerful and efficient representations of collider events. HyPER is used to reconstruct parent particles from sets of final-state objects. Trained and tested on simulation, the HyPER model is shown to perform favorably when compared to existing state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques, while demonstrating superior parameter efficiency. The novel hypergraph approach allows the method to be applied to particle reconstruction in a multitude of different physics processes.</description>

      <title>Collisional energy loss of a heavy quark in a semiquark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By utilizing a background field effective theory, we compute the collisional energy loss of a heavy quark moving through a semiquark-gluon plasma characterized by nontrivial holonomy for Polyakov loops. We consider the elastic scatterings between the incident heavy quark and the thermal partons with both hard and soft momentum transfers. As compared to the energy loss obtained from the perturbation theory, the hard processes get modified through the thermal distribution functions that depend on the background field, while the proper treatment of the soft processes strongly relies on the use of the hard-thermal-loop resummed gluon propagator derived from the background field effective theory. Our results show that the heavy quark energy loss is significantly suppressed in the semiquark-gluon plasma due to a background field that is self-consistently generated in the effective theory. On the other hand, the suppression has a strong dependence on the temperature of the plasma which becomes negligible above $2 - 3 $ times the critical temperature. For a realistic coupling constant, ignoring a relatively weak dependence on the heavy quark velocity, the suppression on the collisional energy loss can be approximated by an overall factor determined solely by the background field. This simple conclusion is expected to be useful for phenomenological applications in the heavy flavor physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are intimately connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$ and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryon masses, we determine for the first time unambigously the trajectories of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point $(\mathrm{Tr}[M]=C)$ accurately. At $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV, our results are consistent with the lattice simulations, and the extrapolations to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral Lagrangians, agree well with existing experimental analyses. We predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, consistent with the LO interaction's dominance. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO, the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1583(5)(1)$ MeV, being dominantly a SU(3) singlet, while the higher pole belongs to the octet representation with a mass of $E^{(8)}=1585(8)(2)$ MeV. This can be tested in future LQCD simulations and experimental measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that the two nearby resonances observed by BESIII partially below the \,$p\bar p$\, threshold might be due to mixing between two metastable states with the same $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ quantum numbers, but rather different internal structure. One is a $p \bar p$ hadronic molecule and the other a bound state of a light-quark diquark and an antidiquark, both with spin 1 and isospin 0, a composite color antitriplet and triplet, respectively. The doubling of resonances, one of which may be interpreted as a hadronic molecule, while the other arises from $q \bar q$ annihilation in a state with vacuum quantum numbers may be a more general feature than the specific case considered here.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel covariant bilinear formalism for the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) which utilises the Dirac algebra associated with the SL(2,C) group that acts on the scalar doublet field space. This Dirac-algebra approach enables us to obtain a fully O(1,3)-covariant and IR-safe expression for the one-loop effective potential. We illustrate how the formalism can be used to evaluate the breaking of global symmetries of the 2HDM potential by loop effects, in a field-reparameterisation invariant manner.</description>

      <title>Testing the assumptions of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure</title>

Abstract: The Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) attempts to amend some of the shortcomings of the traditional perturbative methods used in cosmology. It models the evolution of long-wavelength perturbations above a cutoff scale without the need for a detailed description of the short-wavelength ones. Short-scale physics is encoded in the coefficients of a series of operators composed of the long-wavelength fields, and ordered in a systematic expansion. As applied in the literature, the EFTofLSS corrects a summary statistic (such as the power spectrum) calculated from standard perturbation theory by matching it to $N$-body simulations or observations. This `bottom-up' construction is remarkably successful in extending the range of validity of perturbation theory. In this work, we compare this framework to a `top-down' approach, which estimates the EFT coefficients from the stress tensor of an $N$-body simulation, and propagates the corrections to the summary statistic. We consider simple initial conditions, viz. two sinusoidal, plane-parallel density perturbations with substantially different frequencies and amplitudes. We find that the leading EFT correction to the power spectrum in the top-down model is in excellent agreement with that inferred from the bottom-up approach which, by construction, provides an exact match to the numerical data. This result is robust to changes in the wavelength separation between the two linear perturbations. However, in our setup, the leading EFT coefficient does not always grow linearly with the cosmic expansion factor as assumed in the literature based on perturbative considerations. Instead, it decreases after orbit crossing takes place.</description>

      <title>Weyl quadratic gravity as a gauge theory and non-metricity vs torsion duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review (non-supersymmetric) gauge theories of four-dimensional space-time symmetries and their quadratic action. The only true gauge theory of such a symmetry (with a physical gauge boson) that has an exact geometric interpretation, generates Einstein gravity in its spontaneously broken phase and is anomaly-free, is that of Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). Gauging the full conformal group does not generate a true gauge theory of physical (dynamical) associated gauge bosons. Regarding the Weyl gauge symmetry, it is naturally realised in Weyl conformal geometry, where it admits two different but equivalent geometric formulations, of same quadratic action: one non-metric but torsion-free, the other Weyl gauge-covariant and metric (with respect to a new differential operator). To clarify the origin of this intriguing result, a third equivalent formulation of this gauge symmetry is constructed using the standard, modern approach on the tangent space (uplifted to space-time by the vielbein), which is metric but has vectorial torsion. This shows an interesting duality vectorial non-metricity vs vectorial torsion of the corresponding formulations, related by a projective transformation. We comment on the physical meaning of these results.</description>

Abstract: We investigated a possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), cosmic chronometers, and baryon acoustic oscillation samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of an up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Sliding into DM: Determining the local dark matter density and speed distribution using only the local circular speed of the Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use FIRE-2 zoom simulations of Milky Way size disk galaxies to derive easy-to-use relationships between the observed circular speed of the Galaxy at the Solar location, $v_\mathrm{c}$, and dark matter properties of relevance for direct detection experiments: the dark matter density, the dark matter velocity dispersion, and the speed distribution of dark matter particles near the Solar location. We find that both the local dark matter density and 3D velocity dispersion follow tight power laws with $v_\mathrm{c}$. Using this relation together with the observed circular speed of the Milky Way at the Solar radius, we infer the local dark matter density and velocity dispersion near the Sun to be $\rho = 0.42\pm 0.06\ \mathrm{GeV}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 3D} = 280^{+19}_{-18}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. We also find that the distribution of dark matter particle speeds is well-described by a modified Maxwellian with two shape parameters, both of which correlate with the observed $v_{\rm c}$. We use that modified Maxwellian to predict the speed distribution of dark matter near the Sun and find that it peaks at a most probable speed of $257\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and begins to truncate sharply above $470\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. This peak speed is somewhat higher than expected from the standard halo model, and the truncation occurs well below the formal escape speed to infinity, with fewer very-high-speed particles than assumed in the standard halo model.</description>

      <title>Relativistic head-on collisions of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collision dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls by performing high-resolution numerical simulations in axisymmetry. Focusing on the case of relativistic head-on collisions, we consider the effects of the initial velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and electromagnetic coupling strength on the outcome of the collision. We find that the collision dynamics can depend strongly on these parameters; most notably, electromagnetic effects can significantly alter the outcome of the collision when the gauge coupling is large. When the gauge coupling is small, we find that the dynamics generally resemble those of ordinary (non-gauged) Q-balls.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Primordial Magnetic Blackhole: Cosmic Production and Physical Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electroweak monopole, when coupled to gravity, turns to the Reissner-Nordstrom type primordial magnetic blackhole whose mass is bounded below, with the lower bound $M_P \sqrt \alpha$. This changes the overall picture of the monopole production mechanism in the early universe drastically and has deep implications in cosmolpgy. In particular, this enhances the possibility that the electroweak monopoles turned to the primordial magnetic blackholes could become the seed of stellar objects and galaxies, and account for the dark matter of the universe. Moreover, this tells that we have a new type of primordial blackhole different from the popular primordial blackhole in cosmology, the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole based on a totally different production mechanism. We discuss the physical implications of the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole.</description>
