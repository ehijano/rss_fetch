      <title>On the generic degree of two-parameter period mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for computing the generic degree of a period map defined on a quasi-projective surface. As an application, we explicitly compute the generic degree of three period maps underlying families of Calabi-Yau 3-folds coming from toric hypersurfaces. As a consequence, we show that the generic Torelli theorem holds for these cases.</description>

      <title>The generic \'{e}taleness of the moduli space of dormant $\mathfrak{so}_{2\ell}$-opers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generic \'{e}taleness is an important property on the moduli space of dormant $\mathfrak{g}$-opers (for a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$) in the context of enumerative geometry. In the previous study, this property has been verified under the assumption that $\mathfrak{g}$ is either $\mathfrak{sl}_\ell$, $\mathfrak{so}_{2\ell -1}$, or $\mathfrak{sp}_{2\ell}$ for any sufficiently small positive integer $\ell$. The purpose of the present paper is to prove the generic \'{e}taleness for one of the remaining cases, i.e., $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{so}_{2\ell}$. As an application of this result, we obtain a factorization formula for computing the generic degree induced from pull-back along various clutching morphisms between moduli spaces of pointed stable curves.</description>

      <title>Frobenius pull-back of parabolic bundles and dormant opers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parabolic bundles on an algebraic curve in positive characteristic. Our motivation is to properly formulate Frobenius pull-backs of parabolic bundles in a way that extends various previous facts and arguments for the usual non-parabolic Frobenius pull-backs. After defining that operation, we generalize a classical result by Cartier concerning Frobenius descent, that is, we establish a bijective correspondence (including the version using higher-level $\mathcal{D}$-modules) between parabolic flat bundles with vanishing $p$-curvature on a pointed curve and parabolic bundles on its Frobenius twist. This correspondence gives a description of maximally Frobenius-destabilized parabolic bundles in terms of dormant opers admitting logarithmic poles. As an application of that description together with a previous result in the enumerative geometry of dormant opers, we obtain an explicit formula for computing the number of such parabolic bundles of rank $2$ under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>Existence of minimal models for threefold generalized pairs in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;5$. We show the existence of minimal models for pseudo-effective NQC klt generalized pairs in dimension three over $\mathbb{K}$. As a consequence, we prove the termination of flips for pseudo-effective threefold NQC klt generalized pairs over $\mathbb{K}$. This provides a new proof on the termination of flips for pseudo-effective pairs over $\mathbb{K}$ without using the non-vanishing theorems. A key ingredient of our proof is the ACC for lc thresholds in dimension $\leq 3$ and the global ACC in dimension $\leq 2$ for generalized pairs over $\mathbb{K}$.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality of tropical Chow groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the existence of non-zero tropical forms of degree at least two implies that the tropical Chow group of points of a tropical affine manifold is infinite-dimensional. This can be seen as a tropical analog of classical results of Mumford and Roitman for Chow groups of smooth (complex) projective algebraic varieties. We also show that the existence of tropical 1-forms on tropical surfaces does not imply infinite dimensionality by considering the case of a tropical Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>Cohomological containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study cohomological containers. Containers naturally come up in the context of the Brauer group and the Tate conjecture. They were previously studied in a special case by Beauville in his work on surfaces of maximal Picard number, and are related to the work of Totaro on Hodge structures with no middle pieces. Containers are complex tori, and it is generally quite difficult to tell if they are algebraic. After discussing some general theory, we compute numerous examples of containers in various degrees for special classes of varieties: abelian varieties of maximal Picard number, Kummer varieties, and singular K3 surfaces. It turns out that all of these containers are algebraic. We compute their fields of definition.</description>

      <title>Scheme-theoretic coisotropic reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an affine scheme-theoretic version of Hamiltonian reduction by symplectic groupoids. It works over $\Bbbk=\mathbb{R}$ or $\Bbbk=\mathbb{C}$, and is formulated for an affine symplectic groupoid $\mathcal{G}\rightrightarrows X$, an affine Hamiltonian $\mathcal{G}$-scheme $\mu:M\longrightarrow X$, a coisotropic subvariety $S\subseteq X$, and a stabilizer subgroupoid $\mathcal{H}\rightrightarrows S$. Our first main result is that the Poisson bracket on $\Bbbk[M]$ induces a Poisson bracket on the subquotient $\Bbbk[\mu^{-1}(S)]^{\mathcal{H}}$. The Poisson scheme $\mathrm{Spec}(\Bbbk[\mu^{-1}(S)]^{\mathcal{H}})$ is then declared to be a Hamiltonian reduction of $M$. Other main results include sufficient conditions for $\mathrm{Spec}(\Bbbk[\mu^{-1}(S)]^{\mathcal{H}})$ to inherit a residual Hamiltonian scheme structure.
  Our main results are best viewed as affine scheme-theoretic counterparts to an earlier paper, where we simultaneously generalize several Hamiltonian reduction processes. In this way, the present work yields scheme-theoretic analogues of Marsden-Ratiu reduction, Mikami-Weinstein reduction, \'{S}niatycki-Weinstein reduction, and symplectic reduction along general coisotropic submanifolds. The initial impetus for this work was its utility in formulating and proving generalizations of the Moore-Tachikawa conjecture.</description>

      <title>Classifying Entanglement by Algebraic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is one of the key manifestations of quantum mechanics that separate the quantum realm from the classical one. Characterization of entanglement as a physical resource for quantum technology became of uppermost importance. While the entanglement of bipartite systems is already well understood, the ultimate goal to cope with the properties of entanglement of multipartite systems is still far from being realized. This dissertation covers characterization of multipartite entanglement using algebraic-geometric tools. Firstly, we establish an algorithm to classify multipartite entanglement by $k$-secant varieties of the Segre variety and $\ell$-multilinear ranks that are invariant under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC). We present a fine-structure classification of multiqubit and tripartite entanglement based on this algorithm. Another fundamental problem in quantum information theory is entanglement transformation that is quite challenging regarding to multipartite systems. It is captivating that the proposed entanglement classification by algebraic geometry can be considered as a reference to study SLOCC and asymptotic SLOCC interconversions among different resources based on tensor rank and border rank, respectively. In this regard, we also introduce a new class of tensors that we call \emph{persistent tensors} and construct a lower bound for their tensor rank. We further cover SLOCC convertibility of multipartite systems considering several families of persistent tensors.</description>

      <title>Bihamiltonian structure of the DR hierarchy in the semisimple case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the double ramification (DR) hierarchy of a homogeneous semisimple cohomological field theory (CohFT) with metric $\eta$ is bihamiltonian with respect to the Poisson operator $\eta^{-1} \partial_x$ and a second Poisson operator introduced in a previous work of ours in collaboration with S. Shadrin. This second Poisson operator has a simple and explicit expression in terms of the generating function of intersection numbers of the CohFT with the DR cycle and the top Hodge class $\lambda_g$. Our proof is based on two recently proved results: the equivalence of the double ramification hierarchy and the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy of a semisimple CohFT under Miura transformation and the polynomiality of the second Poisson bracket of the DZ hierarchy of a homogeneous semisimple CohFT. In particular our second Poisson bracket coincides through DR/DZ equivalence with the second Poisson bracket of the DZ hierarchy, hence providing a remarkably explicit approach to their bihamiltonian structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.03364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the Bethe ansatz equations for Gaudin model and Miura opers in characteristic $p&gt;0$. Our study is based on a work by E. Frenkel, in which solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations are described in terms of Miura opers on the complex projective line. The main result of the present paper provides a positive characteristic analogue of this description. We pay particular attention to the case of Miura $\mathrm{PGL}_2$-opers because dormant generic Miura $\mathrm{PGL}_2$-opers correspond bijectively to Tango structures, which bring various sorts of exotic phenomena in positive characteristic, e.g., counter-examples to the Kodaira vanishing theorem. As a consequence, we construct new examples of Tango structures by means of solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations modulo $p$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic liftings and 2d TQFT for dormant opers of higher level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript represents an advance in the enumerative geometry of opers that takes the subject beyond our previous work. Motivated by a counting problem of linear differential equations in positive characteristic, we investigate the moduli space of opers from arithmetic and combinatorial points of view. We construct a compactified moduli space classifying dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_n^{(N)}$-opers (i.e., dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_n$-opers of level $N$) on pointed stable curves in characteristic $p&gt;0$. One of the key results is the generic \'{e}taleness of that space for $n=2$, which is proved by obtaining a detailed understanding of relevant deformation spaces. This fact induces a certain arithmetic lifting of each dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{(N)}$-oper on a general curve to characteristic $p^N$; this lifting is called the canonical diagonal lifting. On the other hand, the generic \'{e}taleness also implies that the degree function for the moduli spaces in the rank $2$ case satisfies factorization properties determined by various gluing morphisms of the underlying curves. That is to say, the degree function forms a $2$d TQFT (= a $2$-dimensional topological quantum field theory); it leads us to describe dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{(N)}$-opers in terms of edge numberings on trivalent graphs, as well as lattice points inside generalized rational polytopes. These results yield an effective way of computing the numbers of such objects and $2$nd order differential equations in characteristic $p^N$ with a full set of solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a family of conjectural relations in the tautological cohomology of the moduli spaces of stable algebraic curves of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points. A large part of these relations has a surprisingly simple form: the tautological classes involved in the relations are given by stable graphs that are trees and that are decorated only by powers of the psi-classes at half-edges. We show that the proposed conjectural relations imply certain fundamental properties of the Dubrovin-Zhang (DZ) and the double ramification (DR) hierarchies associated to F-cohomological field theories. Our relations naturally extend a similar system of conjectural relations, which were proposed in an earlier work of the first author together with Gu\'er\'e and Rossi and which are responsible for the normal Miura equivalence of the DZ and the DR hierarchy associated to an arbitrary cohomological field theory. Finally, we prove all the above mentioned relations in the case $n=1$ and arbitrary $g$ using a variation of the method from a paper by Liu and Pandharipande, this can be of independent interest. In particular, this proves the main conjecture from our previous joined work together with Hern\'andez Iglesias. We also prove all the above mentioned relations in the case $g=0$ and arbitrary $n$.</description>

Abstract: Up to finite \'etale cover, any smooth complex projective variety $X$ with nef anti-canonical bundle is a holomorphic fibre bundle over a $K$-trivial variety with locally constant transition functions. We show that this result is optimal by proving that any projective fibre bundle with locally constant transition functions over a $K$-trivial variety has a nef anti-canonical bundle. Moreover, we complement some results on the structure theory of varieties whose tangent bundle admits a singular hermitean metric of positive curvature.</description>

Abstract: A conjecturally complete list of connected components of complements of discriminant varieties (aka wave fronts) of smooth function singularities of type $X_{10}^3$ and $X_{10}^1$ is presented; it are the first examples of not semi-quasihomogeneous plane function singularities. It is shown that the complements of discriminants of singularities of classes $X_9^{\pm}$ and $X_{10}^1$ have non-trivial 1-dimensional homology groups, in contrast to all simple singularity classes.</description>

      <title>Even-carry polynomials and cohomology of line bundles on the incidence correspondence in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the cohomology groups of line bundles $\mathcal{L}$ on the \emph{incidence correspondence}, that is, a general hypersurface $X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ of degrees $(1,1)$. Whereas the characteristic $0$ situation is completely understood, the cohomology in characteristic $p$ depends in a mysterious way on the base-$p$ digits of the degrees $(d, e)$ of $\mathcal{L}$. Gao and Raicu (following Linyuan Liu) prove a recursive description of the cohomology for $n = 3$, which relates to Nim polynomials when $p = 2$. In this paper, we devise a suitable generalization of Nim polynomials, which we call \emph{even-carry polynomials,} by which we can solve the recurrence of Liu--Gao--Raicu to yield an explicit formula for the cohomology for $n = 3$ and general $p$. We also make some conjectures on the general form of the cohomology for general $n$ and $p$.</description>

Abstract: In a previous work, we stated the conjecture that any semiring homomorphism between the Boolean function semirings on 1-dimensional tropical fans has the property called geometric. In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true. As an application, we establish a way to find all the morphisms between given 1-dimensional tropical fans.</description>
