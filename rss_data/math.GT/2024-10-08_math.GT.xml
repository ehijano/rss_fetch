      <title>Volumes, Lorenz-like templates, and braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorenz-like templates are obtained from applying half twists to the two strips of the Lorenz template. Ghrist proved that infinitely many of these templates are universal, meaning they contain all links in the 3-sphere. In this paper, we generalise the bunch algorithm to construct links embedded in universal Lorenz-like templates and provide an upper volume bound that is quadratic in the trip number. We also establish a correspondence between links embedded in these universal Lorenz-like templates and generalised T-links. While generalised T-links have appeared in the knot theory literature before, we prove that they are, in fact, all links in the 3-sphere. Thus, we can regard each link in the 3-sphere as a generalised T-link, which has an associated Lorenz link. We use the upper bound obtained from the generalised bunch algorithm to provide an upper volume bound for all hyperbolic link complements in the 3-sphere. Such a bound grows quadratically in terms of the braid indexes of the associated Lorenz links.</description>

      <title>Immersed surfaces with knot group $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with locally flatly immersed surfaces in simply-connected $4$-manifolds where the complement of the surface has fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}$. Once the genus and number of double points are fixed, we classify such immersed surfaces in terms of the equivariant intersection form of their exterior and a secondary invariant. Applications include criteria for deciding when an immersed $\mathbb{Z}$-surface in $S^4$ is isotopic to the standard immersed surface that is obtained from an unknotted surface by adding local double points. As another application, we enumerate $\mathbb{Z}$-disks in $D^4$ with a single double point and boundary a given knot; we prove that the number of such disks may be infinite. We also prove that a knot bounds a $\mathbb{Z}$-disk in $D^4$ with $c_+$ positive double points and $c_-$ negative double points if and only if it can be converted into an Alexander polynomial one knot via changing $c_+$ positive crossings and $c_-$ negative crossings. In $4$-manifolds other than $D^4$ and $S^4$, applications include measuring the extent to which immersed $\mathbb{Z}$-surfaces are determined by the equivariant intersection form of their exterior. Along the way, we prove that any two $\mathbb{Z}^2$-concordances between the Hopf link and an Alexander polynomial one link $L$ are homeomorphic rel. boundary.</description>

      <title>Invariant multi-functions and Hamiltonian flows for surface group representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goldman defined a symplectic form on the smooth locus of the $G$-character variety of a closed, oriented surface $S$ for a Lie group $G$ satisfying very general hypotheses. He then studied the Hamiltonian flows associated to $G$-invariant functions $G \to \mathbb R$ obtained by evaluation on a simple closed curve and proved that they are generalized twist flows. In this article, we investigate the Hamiltonian flows on (subsets of the) $G$-character variety induced by evaluating a $G$-invariant multi-function $G^k \to \mathbb R$ on a tuple $ \underline{\alpha} \in \pi_1(S)^k$. We introduce the notion of a subsurface deformation along a supporting subsurface $S_0$ for $\underline{\alpha}$ and prove that the Hamiltonian flow of an induced invariant multi-function is of this type. We also give a formula for the Poisson bracket between two functions induced by invariant multi-functions and prove that they Poisson commute if their supporting subsurfaces are disjoint. We give many examples of functions on character varieties that arise in this way and discuss applications, for example, to the flow associated to the trace function for non-simple closed curves on $S$.</description>

      <title>Dislocations and Fibrations: The Topological Structure of Knotted Smectic Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the topological properties of knotted defects in smectic liquid crystals. Our story begins with screw dislocations, whose radial surface structure can be smoothly accommodated on $S^3$ for fibred knots by using the corresponding knot fibration. To understand how a smectic texture may take on a screw dislocation in the shape of a knot without a fibration, we study first knotted edge defects. Unlike screw defects, knotted edge dislocations force singular points in the system for any non-trivial knot. We provide a lower bound on the number of such point defects required for a given edge dislocation knot and draw an analogy between the point defect structure of knotted edge dislocations and that of focal conic domains. By showing that edge dislocations, too, are sensitive to knot fibredness, we reinterpret the so-called Morse-Novikov points required for non-fibred screw dislocation knots as analogous smectic defects. Our methods are then applied to $+1/2$ and negative-charge disclinations in the smectic phase, furthering the analogy between knotted smectic defects and focal conic domains and uncovering an intricate relationship between point and line defects in smectic liquid crystals. The connection between smectic defects and knot theory not only unravels the uniquely topological knotting of smectic defects but also provides a mathematical and experimental playground for modern questions in knot and Morse-Novikov theory.</description>

      <title>Focal surfaces and evolutes of framed curves in hyperbolic 3-space from the viewpoint of Legendrian duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hyperbolic framed curve is a smooth curve with a moving frame in hyperbolic 3-space. It may have singularities. By using this moving frame, we can investigate the differential geometry properties of curves, even at singular points. In fact, we consider the focal surfaces and evolutes of hyperbolic framed curves by using Legendrian dualities which developed by Chen and Izumiya. The focal surfaces are the dual surfaces of tangent indicatrix of original curves. Moreover, classifications of singularities of the serval dual surfaces are shown. By this, we give the relationship among focal surfaces, evolutes and dual surfaces of evolutes. Finally, we study duality relations of singularities between focal surfaces and dual surfaces of evolutes.</description>

      <title>Basins of Equilibria and geometry of Global Sectors in Holomorphic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper to [Local geometry of Equilibria and a Poincare-Bendixson-type Theorem for Holomorphic Flows, Nicolas Kainz, Dirk Lebiedz (2004)] we investigate the global topology and geometry of dynamical systems $\dot{x} = F(x)$ with entire vector field $F$ by exploiting and extending the local structure of finite elliptic decompositions. We prove topological properties of the basins of centers, nodes, and foci, while excluding isolated equilibria at the boundaries of the latter two. We propose a definition of global elliptic sectors and introduce the notion of a sector-forming orbit allowing global topological analysis. The structure of heteroclinic regions between two equilibria is characterized.</description>

      <title>Topological monodromy kernels for fundamental groups of discriminant complements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear system on a smooth complex algebraic surface gives rise to a family of smooth curves in the surface. Such a family has a topological monodromy representation valued in the mapping class group of a fiber. Extending arguments of Kuno, we show that if the image of this representation is of finite index, then the kernel is infinite. This applies in particular to linear systems on smooth toric surfaces and on smooth complete intersections. In the case of plane curves, we extend the techniques of Carlson-Toledo to show that the kernel is quite rich (e.g. it contains a nonabelian free group).</description>

Abstract: A set of regions of a link projection is said to be isolated if any pair of regions in the set share no crossings. The isolate-region number of a link projection is the maximum value of the cardinality for isolated sets of regions of the link projection. In this paper, all the link projections of isolate-region number one are determined. Also, estimations for welded unknotting number and combinatorial way to find the isolate-region number are discussed, and a formula of the generating function of isolated-region sets is given for the standard projections of $(2, n)$-torus links.</description>

      <title>Connecting essential triangulations II: via 2-3 moves only</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work we showed that for a manifold $M$, whose universal cover has infinitely many boundary components, the set of essential ideal triangulations of $M$ is connected via 2-3, 3-2, 0-2, and 2-0 moves. Here we show that this set is also connected via 2-3 and 3-2 moves alone, if we ignore those triangulations for which no 2-3 move preserves essentiality. If we also allow V-moves and their inverses then the full set of essential ideal triangulations of $M$ is once again connected. These results also hold if we replace essential triangulations with $L$-essential triangulations.</description>

      <title>A recursive relation in the $(2p+1,2)$ torus knot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the colored Jones polynomials of a knot in the 3-dimensional sphere satisfy recursive relations, it is also known that these recursive relations come from recurrence polynomials which have been related, by the AJ conjecture, to the geometry of the knot complement. In this paper we propose a new line of thought, by extending the concept of colored Jones polynomials to knots in the 3-dimensional manifold such as a knot complement, and then examining the case of one particular knot in the complement of the $(2p+1,2)$ torus knot for which an analogous recursive relation exists, and moreover, this relation has an associated recurrence polynomial. Part of our study consists of the writing in the standard basis of the genus two handlebody of two families of skeins in this handlebody.</description>

Abstract: We define a new algebra associated to a Legendrian submanifold $\Lambda$ of a contact manifold of the form $\mathbb{R}_{t} \times W$, called the planar diagram algebra and denoted $PDA(\Lambda, \mathcal{P})$. It is a non-commutative, filtered, differential graded algebra whose filtered stable tame isomorphism class is an invariant of $\Lambda$ together with a partition $\mathcal{P}$ of its connected components. When $\Lambda$ is connected, $PDA$ is the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra. In general, the $PDA$ differential counts holomorphic disks with multiple positive punctures using a combinatorial framework inspired by string topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that virtually torsion-free, residually finite groups that are inner-amenable and non-amenable have the cheap 1-rebuilding property, a notion recently introduced by Ab\'ert, Bergeron, Fr\k{a}czyk and Gaboriau. As a consequence, the first $\ell^2$-Betti number with arbitrary field coefficients and log-torsion in degree 1 vanish for these groups. This extends results previously known for amenable groups to inner-amenable groups. We use a structure theorem of Tucker-Drob for inner-amenable groups showing the existence of a chain of q-normal subgroups.</description>

Abstract: Let $T_{g,n}$ be a compact orientable topological surface of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points and let $M(g,n)$ denote its mapping class group. We study the action on the fundamental group of the surface induced by the self-homeomorphisms of the mapping class group by describing completely the case of positive genus. In order to do so, we use a presentation for the mapping class group with generators the Humphries generators and compute their images as elements of the outer automorphism group of the fundamental group, since the action is defined only up to conjugation.</description>
