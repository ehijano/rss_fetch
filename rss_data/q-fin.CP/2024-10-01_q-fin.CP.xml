      <title>Portfolio Stress Testing and Value at Risk (VaR) Incorporating Current Market Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value at Risk (VaR) and stress testing are two of the most widely used approaches in portfolio risk management to estimate potential market value losses under adverse market moves. VaR quantifies potential loss in value over a specified horizon (such as one day or ten days) at a desired confidence level (such as 95'th percentile). In scenario design and stress testing, the goal is to construct extreme market scenarios such as those involving severe recession or a specific event of concern (such as a rapid increase in rates or a geopolitical event), and quantify potential impact of such scenarios on the portfolio. The goal of this paper is to propose an approach for incorporating prevailing market conditions in stress scenario design and estimation of VaR so that they provide more accurate and realistic insights about portfolio risk over the near term. The proposed approach is based on historical data where historical observations of market changes are given more weight if a certain period in history is "more similar" to the prevailing market conditions. Clusters of market conditions are identified using a Machine Learning approach called Variational Inference (VI) where for each cluster future changes in portfolio value are similar. VI based algorithm uses optimization techniques to obtain analytical approximations of the posterior probability density of cluster assignments (market regimes) and probabilities of different outcomes for changes in portfolio value. Covid related volatile period around the year 2020 is used to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach and in particular show how VaR and stress scenarios adapt quickly to changing market conditions. Another advantage of the proposed approach is that classification of market conditions into clusters can provide useful insights about portfolio performance under different market conditions.</description>

      <title>American Call Options Pricing With Modular Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate valuation of American call options is critical in most financial decision making environments. However, traditional models like the Barone-Adesi Whaley (B-AW) and Binomial Option Pricing (BOP) methods fall short in handling the complexities of early exercise and market dynamics present in American options. This paper proposes a Modular Neural Network (MNN) model which aims to capture the key aspects of American options pricing. By dividing the prediction process into specialized modules, the MNN effectively models the non-linear interactions that drive American call options pricing. Experimental results indicate that the MNN model outperform both traditional models as well as a simpler Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) across multiple stocks (AAPL, NVDA, QQQ), with significantly lower RMSE and nRMSE (by mean). These findings highlight the potential of MNNs as a powerful tool to improve the accuracy of predicting option prices.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Instruction-tuned LLMs for Finance without Instruction Data Using Continual Pretraining and Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for constructing instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) for finance without instruction data. Traditionally, developing such domain-specific LLMs has been resource-intensive, requiring a large dataset and significant computational power for continual pretraining and instruction tuning. Our study proposes a simpler approach that combines domain-specific continual pretraining with model merging. Given that general-purpose pretrained LLMs and their instruction-tuned LLMs are often publicly available, they can be leveraged to obtain the necessary instruction task vector. By merging this with a domain-specific pretrained vector, we can effectively create instruction-tuned LLMs for finance without additional instruction data. Our process involves two steps: first, we perform continual pretraining on financial data; second, we merge the instruction-tuned vector with the domain-specific pretrained vector. Our experiments demonstrate the successful construction of instruction-tuned LLMs for finance. One major advantage of our method is that the instruction-tuned and domain-specific pretrained vectors are nearly independent. This independence makes our approach highly effective. The Japanese financial instruction-tuned LLMs we developed in this study are available at https://huggingface.co/pfnet/nekomata-14b-pfn-qfin-inst-merge.</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Network Approximation of Transition Densities in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces FourNet, a novel single-layer feed-forward neural network (FFNN) method designed to approximate transition densities for which closed-form expressions of their Fourier transforms, i.e. characteristic functions, are available. A unique feature of FourNet lies in its use of a Gaussian activation function, enabling exact Fourier and inverse Fourier transformations and drawing analogies with the Gaussian mixture model. We mathematically establish FourNet's capacity to approximate transition densities in the $L_2$-sense arbitrarily well with finite number of neurons. The parameters of FourNet are learned by minimizing a loss function derived from the known characteristic function and the Fourier transform of the FFNN, complemented by a strategic sampling approach to enhance training. We derive practical bounds for the $L_2$ estimation error and the potential pointwise loss of nonnegativity in FourNet for $d$-dimensions ($d\ge 1$), highlighting its robustness and applicability in practical settings. FourNet's accuracy and versatility are demonstrated through a wide range of dynamics common in quantitative finance, including L\'{e}vy processes and the Heston stochastic volatility models-including those augmented with the self-exciting Queue-Hawkes jump process.</description>
