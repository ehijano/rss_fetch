      <description>arXiv:2409.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that $\operatorname{vol}(S^{d})/8$ is the highest volume of a pair of $d$-dimensional isospectral and non-isometric spherical orbifolds for any $d\geq5$. Furthermore, we show that $\operatorname{vol}(S^{2n-1})/11$ is the highest volume of a pair of $(2n-1)$-dimensional isospectral and non-isometric spherical space forms if either $n\geq11$ and $n\equiv 1\pmod 5$, or $n\geq7$ and $n\equiv 2\pmod 5$, or $n\geq3$ and $n\equiv 3\pmod 5$.</description>

      <title>Sobolev Metrics on Spaces of Discrete Regular Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reparametrization invariant Sobolev metrics on spaces of regular curves have been shown to be of importance in the field of mathematical shape analysis. For practical applications, one usually discretizes the space of smooth curves and considers the induced Riemannian metric on a finite dimensional approximation space. Surprisingly, the theoretical properties of the corresponding finite dimensional Riemannian manifolds have not yet been studied in detail, which is the content of the present article. Our main theorem concerns metric and geodesic completeness and mirrors the results of the infinite dimensional setting as obtained by Bruveris, Michor and Mumford.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-timelike loops in signature changing semi-Riemannian manifolds with a transverse radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1983, Hartle and Hawking introduced a conceptually intriguing idea involving signature-type change, which led to the no-boundary proposal for the initial conditions of the universe. According to this proposal, the universe has no beginning because there is no singularity or boundary in spacetime; however, there is an origin of time. Mathematically, this entails signature-type changing manifolds where a Riemannian region smoothly transitions to a Lorentzian region at the surface where time begins.
  We present a coherent framework for signature-type changing manifolds characterized by a degenerate yet smooth metric. We then adapt firmly established Lorentzian tools and results to the signature-type changing scenario, introducing new definitions that carry unforeseen causal implications. A noteworthy consequence is the presence of locally closed time-reversing loops through each point on the hypersurface. By imposing the constraint of global hyperbolicity on the Lorentzian region, we demonstrate that for every point $p\in M$, there exists a pseudo-timelike loop with point of self-intersection $p$. Or put another way, there always exists a closed pseudo-timelike path in $M$ around which the direction of time reverses, and a consistent designation of future-directed and past-directed vectors cannot be defined.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature and normalized Ricci flow on generalized Wallach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proved that the normalized Ricci flow does not preserve the positivity of Ricci curvature of Riemannian metrics on every generalized Wallach space with $a_1+a_2+a_3\le 1/2$, in particular on the spaces $\operatorname{SU}(k+l+m)/\operatorname{SU}(k)\times \operatorname{SU}(l) \times \operatorname{SU}(m)$ and $\operatorname{Sp}(k+l+m)/\operatorname{Sp}(k)\times \operatorname{Sp}(l) \times \operatorname{Sp}(m)$ independently on $k,l$ and $m$. The positivity of Ricci curvature is preserved for all original metrics with $\operatorname{Ric}&gt;0$ on generalized Wallach spaces $a_1+a_2+a_3&gt; 1/2$ if the conditions $4\left(a_j+a_k\right)^2\ge (1-2a_i)(1+2a_i)^{-1}$ hold for all $\{i,j,k\}=\{1,2,3\}$. We also established that the spaces $\operatorname{SO}(k+l+m)/\operatorname{SO}(k)\times \operatorname{SO}(l)\times \operatorname{SO}(m)$ satisfy the above conditions for $\max\{k,l,m\}\le 11$, moreover, additional conditions were found to keep $\operatorname{Ric}&gt;0$ in cases when $\max\{k,l,m\}\le 11$ is violated. Similar questions have also been studied for all other generalized Wallach spaces given in the classification of Yuri\u\i\ Nikonorov.</description>

      <title>On the Focal Locus of Submanifold of a Finsler Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the focal locus of closed (not necessarily compact) submanifolds in a forward complete Finsler manifold. The main goal is to show that the associated normal exponential map is \emph{regular} in the sense of F.W. Warner (\textit{Am. J. of Math.}, 87, 1965). This leads to the proof of the fact that the normal exponential is non-injective near tangent focal points. As an application, following R.L. Bishop's work (\textit{Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.}, 65, 1977), we express the tangent cut locus as a closure of a certain set of points, called separating tangent cut points. This strengthens the results from the present authors' previous work (\textit{J. Geom. Anal.}, 34, 2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the Weinstock inequality for the first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue on star-shaped mean convex domains in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ for $n \geq 4$. In particular, when the domain is convex, our result gives an affirmative answer to Open Question 4.27 in [7] for the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ when $n \geq 4$.</description>

Abstract: We provide a symbolic classification of generalized Seifert fiber spaces, which were introduced by Mitsuishi and Yamaguchi in the classification of collapsing Alexandrov $3$-spaces. Additionally, we show that the canonical double branched cover of a non-manifold generalized Seifert fiber space is a Seifert manifold and compute its symbolic invariants in terms of those of the original space.</description>

      <title>The natural flow and the critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by work of Besson-Courtois-Gallot, we construct a flow called the natural flow on a nonpositively curved Riemannian manifold $M$. As with the natural map, the $k$-Jacobian of the natural flow is directly related to the critical exponent $\delta$ of the fundamental group. There are several applications of the natural flow that connect dynamical, geometrical, and topological invariants of the manifold. First, we give $k$-dimensional linear isoperimetric inequalities when $k &gt; \delta$. This, in turn, produces lower bounds on the Cheeger constant. We resolve a recent conjecture of Dey-Kapovich on the non-existence of $k$-dimensional compact, complex subvarieties of complex hyperbolic manifolds with $2k &gt; \delta$. We also provide upper bounds on the homological dimension, generalizing work of Kapovich and work of Farb with the first two authors. Using different methods, we also give upper bounds on the cohomological dimension which partially resolves a conjecture of Kapovich. We also specialize to the setting of locally symmetric manifolds where we further refine our work. Finally, we introduce a new growth condition on the Bowen-Margulis measure that we call uniformly exponentially bounded that we connect to the cohomological dimension and which could be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We study the $\rm{SU}(3)$-structure induced on an oriented hypersurface of a 7-dimensional manifold with a nearly parallel $\rm{G}_2$-structure. We call such $\rm{SU}(3)$-structures nearly half-flat. We characterise the left invariant nearly half-flat structures on $S^3\times S^3$. This characterisation then help us to systematically analyse nearly parallel $\rm{G}_2$-structures on an interval times $ S^3\times S^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a manifold which admits a metric with positive scalar curvature (or a positive intermediate curvature in a suitable sense). We study the moduli space ${\mathscr{M}}^{{\mathsf{pos}}_*}_{\sqcup}(M\times I)_g$ of concordances of such metrics (with appropriate boundary conditions) which restrict to a given metric $g$ on $M \times \{0\} \cup\partial M \times I$. We show that $\pi_{4*}{\mathscr{M}}^{{\mathsf{pos}}_*}_{\sqcup}(M \times I)_g \otimes {\mathbb Q} \neq 0$ in a stable range provided $\dim M$ is even. We obtain analogous results when positive scalar curvature is replaced by $k$-positive Ricci curvature for $k \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Biharmonic conformal immersions into a 3-dimensional conformally flat space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Ou [12,17], we study biharmonic conformal immersions of surfaces into a conformally flat 3-space. We first give a characterization of biharmonic conformal immersions of totally umbilical surfaces into a generic 3-manifold. As an application, we give a method to produce biharmonic conformal immersions into a conformally flat 3-space. We then use the method to obtain a classification of biharmonic maps in a family of conformal immersions and construct many examples of biharmonic conformal immersions from a 2-sphere into a conformal 3-sphere. Our examples include proper biharmonic conformal immersions of a 2-sphere minus a point into a conformal 3-sphere with nonconstant conformal factor and the biharmonic isometric immersion $S^2(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\to S^3$ which was found in [2]. Finally, we study biharmonic conformal immersions of Hopf cylinders of a Riemannian submersion.</description>

Abstract: In this article studies questions about the existence of left-invariant K\"{a}hler and semi-para-K\"{a}hler structures on six-dimensional unsolvable Lie groups whose Lie algebras are semidirect products. According to the classification results, there are four such Lie algebras. It is shown that one of these four Lie algebras admits left-invariant K\"{a}hler metrics, and the other three admit left-invariant semi-para-K\"{a}hler and semi-K\"{a}hler structures. The paper also shows that a six-dimensional symplectic Lie algebra must be solvable except in one case.</description>

Among them there are three classes of groups on which there are no left-invariant symplectic structures, but there are complex structures. In this work, semi-K\"{a}hler and almost para-semi-K\"{a}hler structures are defined on such Lie groups and their geometric properties are studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schneider introduced an inter-dimensional difference body operator on convex bodies and proved an associated inequality. In the prequel to this work, we showed that this concept can be extended to a rich class of operators from convex geometry and proved the associated isoperimetric inequalities. The role of cosine-like operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^n$ from those in $\mathbb R^n$, were replaced by inter-dimensional simplicial operators, which generate convex bodies in $\mathbb R^{nm}$ from those in $\mathbb R^{n}$ (or vice versa). In this work, we treat the $L^p$ extensions of these operators, and, furthermore, extend the role of the simplex to arbitrary $m$-dimensional convex bodies containing the origin. We establish $m$th-order $L^p$ isoperimetric inequalities, including the $m$th-order versions of the $L^p$ Petty projection inequality, $L^p$ Busemann-Petty centroid inequality, $L^p$ Santal\'o inequalities, and $L^p$ affine Sobolev inequalities. As an application, we obtain isoperimetric inequalities for the volume of the operator norm of linear functionals $(\mathbb R^n, \|\cdot\|_E) \to (\mathbb R^m, \|\cdot\|_F)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $H &lt; G$ both be noncompact connected semisimple real algebraic groups where the former is maximal proper and $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a lattice. Building on the work of Gorodnik-Weiss, we refine their techniques and obtain effective results. More precisely, we prove effective convergence of the distribution of dense $\Gamma$-orbits in $G/H$ to some limiting density on $G/H$ assuming effective equidistribution of regions of maximal horospherical orbits under one-parameter diagonal flows inside a dense $H$-orbit in $\Gamma \backslash G$. The significance of the effectivized argument is due to the recent effective equidistribution results of Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang for $\Delta(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)) &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) \times \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ and $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ and arithmetic lattices $\Gamma$, and future generalizations in that direction.</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity one RCD-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces $(X,d,\mathfrak{m})$ with group actions by isometries preserving the reference measure $\mathfrak{m}$ and whose orbit space has dimension one, i.e. cohomogeneity one actions. To this end we prove a Slice Theorem asserting that each slice at a point is homeomorphic to a non-negatively curved $\mathsf{RCD}$-space. Under the assumption that $X$ is non-collapsed we further show that the slices are homeomorphic to metric cones over homogeneous spaces with $\mathrm{Ric} \geq 0$. As a consequence we obtain complete topological structural results and a principal orbit representation theorem. Conversely, we show how to construct new $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces from a cohomogeneity one group diagram, giving a complete description of $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of cohomogeneity one. As an application of these results we obtain the classification of cohomogeneity one, non-collapsed $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of essential dimension at most $4$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of infinitesimal characters and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by classical results by Benoist, we introduce and study natural objects associated to an integrable tangent vector to the character variety $\mathfrak X(\Gamma,\mathsf G)$ of a semi-group $\Gamma$, with values on a semi-simple real algebraic group $\mathsf G$ of the non-compact type. We obtain non-empty interior of the cone of Jordan variations and, when $\mathsf G$ is split, we obtain double-density results associated to these variations, giving in particular non-empty interior of the set of length-normalized variations. We then apply the developed techniques to study pressure forms on the space of Anosov representations, in particular to higher-rank Teichm\"uller spaces. Among other things we exhibit an explicit functional $\varphi\in\mathfrak a^*$ whose pressure form is compatible with Goldman's symplectic form at the Fuchsian points of the Hitchin component. We finally exhibit a Diophantine equation that governs the degeneration of the Hausdorff dimension of higher-quasi-circles.</description>
