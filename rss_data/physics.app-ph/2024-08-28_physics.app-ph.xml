      <title>Communication-Free Robust Wireless Power Transfer with Constant Output Power and Stable Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary challenge in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems is to achieve efficient and stable power transmission without complex control strategies when load conditions change dynamically. Addressing this issue, we propose a third-order pseudo-Hermitian WPT system whose output characteristics exhibit a stable frequency and constant power. The frequency selection mechanism and energy efficiency of the nonlinear WPT system based on pseudo-Hermitian under the coupling mode theory approximation are analyzed. Theoretical analysis indicates that under certain coupling coefficients and load conditions, the proposed system can achieve frequency adaptation in a stable frequency mode without the need to change the circuit frequency. When the load changes dynamically, the stability of the power output is maintained using a proportional integral (PI) control strategy that only collects the voltage and current at the transmitting end, eliminating the need for wireless communication circuits with feedback from the receiving side. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design scheme can achieve constant power transmission when load conditions change, maintaining stable and relatively high transmission efficiency. The proposed scheme exhibits benefits in practical applications since no communication is required.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>

Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute in enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles which are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first order, second order, topological, and localization phase transitions have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter which can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of tensorial magnetic inertia in terahertz spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic inertia has emerged as a possible way to manipulate ferromagnetic spins at a higher frequency e.g., THz. Theoretical treatments so far have considered the magnetic inertia as a scalar quantity. Here, we explore the magnetic inertial dynamics with a magnetic inertia tensor as macroscopic derivations predicted it to be a tensor. First, the inertia tensor has been decomposed into three terms: (a) scalar and isotropic inertia, (b) anisotropic and symmetric inertia tensor, (c) chiral and antisymmetric tensor. Further, we employ linear response theory to the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the inertia tensor and calculate the effect of chiral and anisotropic inertia on ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. It is established that the precession and nutation resonance frequencies decrease with scalar magnetic inertia. Our results suggest that the nutation resonance frequencies further reduce due to inertia tensor. However, the effective damping of the nutation resonance increases with the chiral and antisymmetric part of the inertia tensor. We show that the precession resonances remain unaffected, while the nutation resonances are modified with the chiral magnetic inertia.</description>

      <title>Brownian Colloids in Optothermal Field: An Experimental Perspective</title>

Abstract: Colloidal matter undergoing Brownian motion serves as a model system to study various physical phenomena. Understanding the effect of external perturbation on the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids has emerged as a relevant research issue in soft matter and biological physics. Optical perturbation in the form of photonic forces and torques has added impetus to this exploration. In recent years, optothermal effects arising due to optical excitation of mesoscale matter have expanded the toolbox of light-colloidal matter interactions. In this perspective, we present an experimental viewpoint on some of the developments related to the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids driven by the optothermal field. Furthermore, we discuss some interesting prospects on driven colloidal matter that can have implications on soft matter physics and soft photonics.</description>

      <title>A "Redox-free" Synthesis of CZTS Nano Ink</title>

Abstract: A large open-circuit (V$_{oc}$) deficit restricts current kesterite device performance. The primary challenge is to achieve control over the phase composition and purity of the kesterite absorber. This is hampered by the fact that the metals copper and tin have multiple valence states and this leads inevitably to the formation of multiple phases. Specifically for solution-based fabrication procedures for kesterite, the pursuit of phase purity extends to the synthesis of CZTS precursor solution or nanoparticle dispersed inks (nano inks). In this work, a "redox-free" synthesis of CZTS nano ink is developed by mixing metal precursors with careful valence state control in non-toxic solvents. The issue of secondary phase formation during the synthesis process of kesterite is effectively resolved. Additionally, molecular solutions and nanoparticle inks with identical compositions exhibit significantly different abilities in phase control. Nanoparticles pre-synthesized in the solution state exhibit superior phase control by following a more ideal phase formation path. This provides a new pathway for the synthesis of kesterite with unprecedented control of the phase composition and purity.</description>

      <title>Non-Volatile Analog Control and Reconfiguration of a Vortex Nano-Oscillator Frequency</title>

Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions are nanoscale devices which have recently attracted interested in the context of frequency multiplexed spintronic neural networks, due to their interesting dynamical properties, which are defined during the fabrication process, and depend on the material parameters and geometry. This paper proposes an approach to extending the functionality of a standard magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by introducing an additional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet (FM/AFM) storage layer (SL) vertically integrated with the standard Vortex MTJ stack into the nanopillar. The magnetostatic field created by this storage layer acts on the free layer and can be used to change its static and dynamic properties. To tune the magnitude and direction of this magnetostatic field, magnetic reconfiguration is carried out through a thermally assisted switching mechanism using a voltage pulse that heats the AFM layer in the SL above the Neel temperature in the presence of an external field. It is experimentally shown that using an MTJ based on a 600 nm diameter nanopillar with a vortex in the free layer, reconfiguration of the SL allows to continuously change the core precession frequency in the 15 MHz range. The reconfigurable analogue storage layer locally affects both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ free layer, demonstrating vertical 3D integration of additional functionalities into a single MTJ nanopillar.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Exchange Bias from Interfacial Reconstruction in an Epitaxial NixCoyFe3-x-yO4(111)/{\alpha}-Al2O3(0001) Thin Film Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13227</link>

Abstract: Intrinsic exchange bias is known as the unidirectional exchange anisotropy that emerges in a nominally single-component ferro-(ferri-)magnetic system. In this work, with magnetic and structural characterizations, we demonstrate that intrinsic exchange bias is a general phenomenon in (Ni, Co, Fe)-based spinel oxide films deposited on {\alpha}-Al2O3(0001) substrates, due to the emergence of a rock-salt interfacial layer consisting of antiferromagnetic CoO from interfacial reconstruction. We show that in NixCoyFe3-x-yO4(111)/{\alpha}-Al2O3(0001) films, intrinsic exchange bias and interfacial reconstruction have consistent dependences on Co concentration y, while the Ni and Fe concentration appears to be less important. This work establishes a family of intrinsic exchange bias materials with great tunability by stoichiometry and highlights the strategy of interface engineering in controlling material functionalities.</description>
