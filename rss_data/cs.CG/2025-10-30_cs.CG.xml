      <title>M-Guarding in K-Visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the problem of $M$-guarding polygons with holes using $k$-visibility guards, where a set of guards is said to $M$-guard a polygon if every point in the polygon is visible to at least $M$ guards, with the constraint that there may only be 1 guard on each edge. A $k$-visibility guard can see through up to $k$ walls, with $k \geq 2$. We present a theorem establishing that any polygon with holes can be 2-guarded under $k$-visibility where $k \geq 2$, which expands existing results in 0-visibility. We provide an algorithm that $M$-guards a polygon using a convex decomposition of the polygon. We show that every point in the polygon is visible to at least four $2$-visibility guards and then extend the result to show that for any even $k \geq 2$ there exists a placement of guards such that every point in the polygon is visible to $k + 2$ guards.</description>

      <title>The Road to the Closest Point is Paved by Good Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\renewcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}$Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\Re^d$, and a parameter $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, we present a new construction of a directed graph $G$, of size $O(n/\varepsilon^d)$, such that $(1+\varepsilon)$-ANN queries can be answered by performing a greedy walk on $G$, repeatedly moving to a neighbor that is (significantly) better than the current point. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of a linear size with no dependency on the spread of the point set. The resulting query time, is $O( \varepsilon^{-d} \log \Psi)$, where $\Psi$ is the spread of $P$. The new construction is surprisingly simple and should be practical.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter Module Approximation: an efficient and interpretable invariant for multi-parameter persistence modules with guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a new parameterized family of topological descriptors, taking the form of candidate decompositions, for multi-parameter persistence modules, and we identify a subfamily of these descriptors, that we call approximate decompositions, that are controllable approximations, in the sense that they preserve diagonal barcodes. Then, we introduce MMA (Multipersistence Module Approximation): an algorithm based on matching functions for computing instances of candidate decompositions with some precision parameter {\delta} &gt; 0. By design, MMA can handle an arbitrary number of filtrations, and has bounded complexity and running time. Moreover, we prove the robustess of MMA: when computed with so-called compatible matching functions, we show that MMA produces approximate decompositions (and we prove that such matching functions exist for n = 2 filtrations). Next, we restrict the focus on modules that can be decomposed into interval summands. In that case, compatible matching functions always exist, and we show that, for small enough {\delta}, the approximate decompositions obtained with such compatible matching functions by MMA have an approximation error (in terms of the standard interleaving and bottleneck distances) that is bounded by {\delta}, and that reaches zero for an even smaller, positive precision. Finally, we present empirical evidence validating that MMA has state-of-the-art performance and running time on several data sets.</description>
