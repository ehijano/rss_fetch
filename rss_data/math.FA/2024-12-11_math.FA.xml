      <title>The four uniform completions of a unital archimedean vector lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the category \(\mathbf{V}\) of unital archimedean vector lattices, four notions of uniform completeness obtain. In all cases completeness requires the convergence of uniformly Cauchy sequences; the completions are distinguished by the manner in which the convergence is regulated. Ordinary uniform convergence is regulated by the canonical unit \(1\). Inner relative uniform convergence, here termed iru-convergence, is regulated by an arbitrary positive element. Outer relative uniform convergence, here termed oru-convergence, is regulated by an arbitrary positive element of a vector lattice containing the given object as a sub-vector lattice. *-convergence is equivalent to ordinary uniform convergence on certain specified quotients of the vector lattice. In each case the complete objects form a full monoreflective subcategory of \(\mathbf{V}\), denoted respectively \(\mathbf{ucV}\), \(\mathbf{irucV}\), \(\mathbf{orucV}\), and \(\mathbf{*cV}\). In this article we provide a unified development of these completions by means of a novel pointfree variant of the classical Yosida adjunction.</description>

      <title>The ball-covering property of non-commutative spaces of operators on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Banach space is said to have the ball-covering property (BCP) if its unit sphere can be covered by countably many closed or open balls off the origin. Let $X$ be a Banach space with a shrinking $1$-unconditional basis. In this paper, by constructing an equivalent norm on $B(X)$, we prove that the quotient Banach algebra $B(X)/K(X)$ fails the BCP. In particular, the result implies that the Calkin algebra $B(H)/ K(H)$, $B(\ell^p)/K(\ell^p)$ ($1 \leq p &lt;\infty$) and $B(c_0)/K(c_0)$ all fail the BCP. We also show that $B(L^p[0,1])$ has the uniform ball-covering property (UBCP) for $3/2&lt; p &lt; 3$.</description>

      <title>SL(n) covariant matrix-valued valuations on Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All continuous, SL(n) covariant valuations on Orlicz spaces are completely classified without any symmetric assumptions. It is shown that the moment matrix is the only such valuation if n\geq3, while a new functional shows up in dimension two.</description>

      <title>W^{2,1}_p Solvability for Parabolic Poincare Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0307377</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0307377v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We study Poincar\'e problem for a linear uniformly parabolic operator $\P$ in a cylinder $Q=\Omega\times (0,T).$ The boundary operator $\B$ is defined by an oblique derivative with respect to a tangential vector field $\l$ defined on the lateral boundary $S.$ The coefficients of $\P$ are supposed to be $VMO$ away from the set of tangency $E$ and to possess higher regularity in $x$ near to $E.$ A unique strong solvability result is obtained in $W^{2,1}_p(Q)$ for all $p\in (1,\infty).$</description>

      <title>Weak l-sequential supercyclicity and weak quasistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that supercyclicity implies strong stability. It is not known whether weak l-sequential supercyclicity implies weak stability. In this paper we prove that weak l-sequential supercyclicity implies weak quasistability. Corollaries concerning the characterisation of (i) weakly l-sequentially supercyclic vectors that are not (strongly) supercyclic, and (ii) weakly l-sequentially supercyclic isometries, are also proved.</description>

      <title>Tensor Products of Fell Bundles over Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/funct-an/9712006</link>
      <description>arXiv:funct-an/9712006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theory of tensor products of C*-algebras to the larger category of Fell bundles over locally compact groups. We prove that, like in the case of C*-algebras, there exist maximal and minimal tensor products. Given two Fell bundles, we compare the tensor products of their cross-sectional algebras with the cross-sectional algebras of their tensor products. As applications we prove that, under certain conditions, the cross-sectional C*-algebra of a Fell bundle is nuclear or exact whenever so is its fiber over the unit element of the group.</description>

      <title>Lifting functionals defined on maps to measure-valued maps via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can one lift a functional defined on maps from a space X to a space Y into a functional defined on maps from X into P(Y) the space of probability distributions over Y? Looking at measure-valued maps can be interpreted as knowing a classical map with uncertainty, and from an optimization point of view the main gain is the convexification of Y into P(Y). We will explain why trying to single out the largest convex lifting amounts to solve an optimal transport problem with an infinity of marginals which can be interesting by itself. Moreover we will show that, to recover previously proposed liftings for functionals depending on the Jacobian of the map, one needs to add a restriction of additivity to the lifted functional.</description>
