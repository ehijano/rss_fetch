      <title>Extreme thunderstorm ground enhancements registered on Aragats in 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, a series of intense Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGEs) were recorded on Mount Aragats in Armenia, with five events exceeding the fair-weather cosmic ray flux by more than 100 percent. This study comprehensively analyzes these TGEs, investigating the atmospheric conditions and electric fields contributing to their occurrence. Key insights include discovering relationships between TGEs and atmospheric electric fields, recovering electron and gamma-ray energy spectra, and the impact of nearby lightning activity. The findings offer a deeper understanding of TGEs' role in atmospheric physics and its synergy with high energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Damping effects of viscous dissipation on growth of symmetric instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric instability (SI) is a frontal instability arising from the interaction of rotation with lateral and vertical shear of a frontal jet and is a generalization of shear, centrifugal, and gravitational instabilities. While the onset of SI has been studied in numerous observations and models, intuition about its growth in physical ocean comes primarily from constant-viscosity linear instability analysis and large eddy simulation (LES). A forward cascade arising from SI in the real ocean, where numerous fine-to-microscale processes interact with growing SI velocity cells, is less understood. While many instances of symmetrically unstable flow have been observed, observations of enhanced turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation ($\epsilon$) at these sites are less common. We use numerical instability analysis of an idealized geostrophic jet to show that viscous-diffusive effects of preexisting turbulence from other turbulent processes (e.g., competing instabilities, internal wave processes, or boundary layer processes) can suppress the growth of SI in the real ocean. For example, a moderate level of ambient turbulence, represented by uniform diffusivity and viscosity of $\kappa =\nu = 10^{-4} m^2/s$, restricts the wavelength range of SI's fastest-growing mode from $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$m to $\mathcal{O}(100)$m and elongates its e-folding timescale by $\mathcal{O}(1-10)$ hrs; suggesting the net viscous-diffusive effects of preexisting turbulence can damp the growth of SI. Viscous damping is one possible explanation for the rarity of SI structures in the real ocean, and our results motivate the inclusion of dependence on previous-timestep $\epsilon$ or $\kappa$ when parameterizing SI in regional models.</description>

      <title>Performance Characterization of Heliotrope Solar Hot-Air Balloons during Multihour Stratospheric Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heliotropes are passive solar hot air balloons that are capable of achieving nearly level flight within the lower stratosphere for several hours. These inexpensive flight platforms enable stratospheric sensing with high-cadence enabled by the low cost to manufacture, but their performance has not yet been assessed systematically. During July to September of 2021, 29 heliotropes were successfully launched from Oklahoma and achieved float altitude as part of the Balloon-based Acoustic Seismology Study (BASS). All of the heliotrope envelopes were nearly identical with only minor variations to the flight line throughout the campaign. Flight data collected during this campaign comprise a large sample to characterize the typical heliotrope flight behavior during launch, ascent, float, and descent. Each flight stage is characterized, dependence on various parameters is quantified, and a discussion of nominal and anomalous flights is provided.</description>

      <title>Influence of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejec5ons on Terrestrial Par5cle Fluxes Through Magnetosphere Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the modulation of particle fluxes at the Earths surface influenced by the intensity and orientation of the Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the Coronal Mass Ejecta (ICME). We examine how IMF and its Bz component, opposing the magnetosphere, significantly enhance geomagnetic activity through magnetic reconnection. This reconnection facilitates increased penetration of solar wind particles into the magnetosphere, thus amplifying the fluxes registered by terrestrial particle detectors and enhancing particle fluxes through reduced cutoff rigidity (magnetospheric effect, ME). Conversely, the orientation of the Bz component is less crucial for a Forbush decrease (FD); instead, the strength of the ejecta's scalar magnetic field (B) predominates, potentially triggering a significant FD. The study explores how magnetic field variations influence the flux of neutrons and muons, effectively modifying the observed rates of cosmic ray influx. Comprehensive data from the WIND magnetometer and Aragats spectrometers underline the direct relationship between ICME magnetic configurations and variations in ground-level particle fluxes. Moreover, we discover that the energy spectra of additional particles during ME are limited to 10 MeV due to the low energy of solar protons entering the terrestrial atmosphere. In contrast, the energy spectra of the missing FD particles can extend up to 100 MeV, demonstrating that magnetic traps and cradles formed by interactions between ejecta and Earth's magnetic fields can also deflect medium-energy solar protons. These insights advance our understanding of geomagnetic modulation of particle fluxes and bolster predictive models of space weather impacts on particle detection technologies.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for tsunami inundation modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use physics-informed neural networks for solving the shallow-water equations for tsunami modeling. Physics-informed neural networks are an optimization based approach for solving differential equations that is completely meshless. This substantially simplifies the modeling of the inundation process of tsunamis. While physics-informed neural networks require retraining for each particular new initial condition of the shallow-water equations, we also introduce the use of deep operator networks that can be trained to learn the solution operator instead of a particular solution only and thus provides substantial speed-ups, also compared to classical numerical approaches for tsunami models. We show with several classical benchmarks that our method can model both tsunami propagation and the inundation process exceptionally well.</description>

      <title>Formulation and calibration of CATKE, a one-equation parameterization for microscale ocean mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe CATKE, a parameterization for fluxes associated with small-scale or "microscale" ocean turbulent mixing on scales between 1 and 100 meters. CATKE uses a downgradient formulation that depends on a prognostic turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) variable and a diagnostic mixing length scale that includes a dynamic convective adjustment (CA) component. With its dynamic convective mixing length, CATKE predicts not just the depth spanned by convective plumes but also the characteristic convective mixing timescale, an important aspect of turbulent convection not captured by simpler static convective adjustment schemes. As a result, CATKE can describe the competition between convection and other processes such as shear-driven mixing and baroclinic restratification. To calibrate CATKE, we use Ensemble Kalman Inversion to minimize the error between 21 large eddy simulations (LES) and predictions of the LES data by CATKE-parameterized single column simulations at three different vertical resolutions. We find that CATKE makes accurate predictions of both idealized and realistic LES compared to microscale turbulence parameterizations commonly used in climate models.</description>

      <title>WeatherQA: Can Multimodal Language Models Reason about Severe Weather?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Severe convective weather events, such as hail, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, often occur quickly yet cause significant damage, costing billions of dollars every year. This highlights the importance of forecasting severe weather threats hours in advance to better prepare meteorologists and residents in at-risk areas. Can modern large foundation models perform such forecasting? Existing weather benchmarks typically focus only on predicting time-series changes in certain weather parameters (e.g., temperature, moisture) with text-only features. In this work, we introduce WeatherQA, the first multimodal dataset designed for machines to reason about complex combinations of weather parameters (a.k.a., ingredients) and predict severe weather in real-world scenarios. The dataset includes over 8,000 (multi-images, text) pairs for diverse severe weather events. Each pair contains rich information crucial for forecasting -- the images describe the ingredients capturing environmental instability, surface observations, and radar reflectivity, and the text contains forecast analyses written by human experts. With WeatherQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision language models, including GPT4, Claude3.5, Gemini-1.5, and a fine-tuned Llama3-based VLM, by designing two challenging tasks: (1) multi-choice QA for predicting affected area and (2) classification of the development potential of severe convection. These tasks require deep understanding of domain knowledge (e.g., atmospheric dynamics) and complex reasoning over multimodal data (e.g., interactions between weather parameters). We show a substantial gap between the strongest VLM, GPT4o, and human reasoning. Our comprehensive case study with meteorologists further reveals the weaknesses of the models, suggesting that better training and data integration are necessary to bridge this gap.

      <title>Photohermal Microswimmer Penetrate Cell Membrane with Cavitation Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled micromotors can efficiently convert ambient energy into mechanical motion, which is of great interest for its potential biomedical applications in delivering therapeutics noninvasively. However, navigating these micromotors through biological barriers remains a significant challenge as most micromotors do not provide sufficient disruption forces in in-vivo conditions. In this study, we employed focused scanning laser from conventional confocal microscope to manipulate carbon microbottle based microswimmers. With the increasing of the laser power, the microswimmers' motions translates from autonomous to directional, and finally the high power laser induced the microswimmer explosions, which effectively deliveres microbottle fragments through the cell membrane. It is revealed that photothermally-induced cavitation bubbles enable the propulsion of microbottles in liquids, where the motion direction can be precisely regulated by the scanning orientation of the laser. Furthermore, the membrane penetration ability of the microbottles promised potential applications in drug delivery and cellular injections. As microbottles navigate toward cells, we strategically increase the laser power to trigger their explosion. By loading microswimmers with transfection genes, cytoplasmic transfection can be realized, which is demonstrated by successful gene transfection of GPF in cells. Our findings open new possibilities for cell injection and gene transfection using micromotors.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is an energy estimate in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. With additional assumptions, it is uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>
