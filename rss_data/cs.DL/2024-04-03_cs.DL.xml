      <title>Sentiment Analysis of Citations in Scientific Articles Using ChatGPT: Identifying Potential Biases and Conflicts of Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific articles play a crucial role in advancing knowledge and informing research directions. One key aspect of evaluating scientific articles is the analysis of citations, which provides insights into the impact and reception of the cited works. This article introduces the innovative use of large language models, particularly ChatGPT, for comprehensive sentiment analysis of citations within scientific articles. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, ChatGPT can discern the nuanced positivity or negativity of citations, offering insights into the reception and impact of cited works. Furthermore, ChatGPT's capabilities extend to detecting potential biases and conflicts of interest in citations, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of scientific literature evaluation. This study showcases the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools in enhancing citation analysis and promoting integrity in scholarly research.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the inter-domain vs intra-domain knowledge flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to how innovations often find success in fields other than their original domains, in this study we explore whether the same holds true for scientific discoveries. We investigate the flow of knowledge across scientific disciplines, focusing on connections between citing and cited publications. Specifically, we analyze the connections among cited publications from 2015 indexed in the Web of Science and their citing counterparts to measure rates of knowledge dissemination within and across different fields. Our study aims to address key research questions concerning the disparities between inter- and intra-domain knowledge dissemination rates, the correlation between knowledge dissemination types and scholarly impact, as well as the evolution of knowledge dissemination patterns over time. These findings deepen our understanding of knowledge flows and offer practical insights with significant implications for evaluative bibliometrics.</description>

      <title>The open access coverage of OpenAlex, Scopus and Web of Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond open access (OA) journals offer a publishing model that is free for both authors and readers, but their lack of indexing in major bibliographic databases presents challenges in assessing the uptake of these journals. Furthermore, OA characteristics such as publication language and country of publication have often been used to support the argument that OA journals are more diverse and aim to serve a local community, but there is a current lack of empirical evidence related to the geographical and linguistic characteristics of OA journals. Using OpenAlex and the Directory of Open Access Journals as a benchmark, this paper investigates the coverage of diamond and gold through authorship and journal coverage in the Web of Science and Scopus by field, country, and language. Results show their lower coverage in WoS and Scopus, and the local scope of diamond OA. The share of English-only journals is considerably higher among gold journals. High-income countries have the highest share of authorship in every domain and type of journal, except for diamond journals in the social sciences and humanities. Understanding the current landscape of diamond OA indexing can aid the scholarly communications network with advancing policy and practices towards more inclusive OA models.</description>

      <title>A proof-of-concept online metadata catalogue service of Earth observation datasets for human health research in exposomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article describes research carried out during 2023 under an International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)-funded project to develop and disseminate a metadata catalogue of Earth observation data sources/products and types that are relevant to human health research in exposomics, as a free service to interested researchers worldwide. The proof-of-concept catalogue was informed by input from existing research literature on the subject (desk research), as well as online communications with, and relevant research publications collected from, a small panel (n = 5) of select experts from the academia in three countries (China, UK and USA). It has 90 metadata records of relevant Earth observation datasets (n = 40) and associated health-focused research publications (n = 50). The project's online portal offers a searchable version of the catalogue featuring a number of search modes and filtering options. It is hoped future, more comprehensive versions of this service will enable more researchers and studies to discover and use remote sensing data about population-level exposures to disease determinants (exposomic determinants of disease) in combination with other relevant data to reveal fresh insights that could improve our understanding of relevant diseases, and hence contribute to the development of better-optimized prevention and management plans to tackle them.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the hierarchical scales of scientists'mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human behaviors, including scientific activities, are shaped by the hierarchical divisions of geography. As a result, researchers' mobility patterns vary across regions, influencing several aspects of the scientific community. These aspects encompass career trajectories, knowledge transfer, international collaborations, talent circulation, innovation diffusion, resource distribution, and policy development. However, our understanding of the relationship between the hierarchical regional scale and scientific movements is limited. This study aims to understand the subtle role of the geographical scales on scientists' mobility patterns across cities, countries, and continents. To this end, we analyzed 2.03 million scientists from 1960 to 2021, spanning institutions, cities, countries, and continents. We built a model based on hierarchical regions with different administrative levels and assessed the tendency for mobility from one region to another and the attractiveness of each region. Our findings reveal distinct nested hierarchies of regional scales and the dynamic of scientists' relocation patterns. This study sheds light on the complex dynamics of scientists' mobility and offers insights into how geographical scale and administrative divisions influence career decisions.</description>
