      <title>Plasmonic Color Filters Enable Label-Free Plasmon-Enhanced Array Tomography with sub-diffraction limited resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) imaging of the subcellular organisation and morphology of cells and tissues is essential for understanding biological function. Although staining is the most widely used approach for visualising biological samples under a microscope, the intracellular refractive index (RI) has been proposed as a potential biophysical marker that could supplement or even surpass the sensitivity of current histological methods. Hence, the development of new, highly sensitive, label-free techniques that can detect changes in the intracellular RI is extremely desirable for biomedical imaging. The recent development of plasmonic metamaterials, designed to mimic a traditional microscope slide, have made it possible to translate subtle changes in refractive index directly into color. This approach enables label-free visualization of tissue microstructure using standard histological slide preparation methods. Here we demonstrate ultramicrotome-assisted optical plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography and correlate this with electron array tomography of the same sample embedded in resin. The approach enables axially super-resolved label-free imaging of whole cells in the range of 30-200 nm and shows great potential for multimodal three-dimensional colorimetric histology at the (sub-) organelle level.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Tailoring of Shockley-Ramo Bipolar Photocurrent in Self-powered GaAs Nanodevices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipolar photoresponse - where photocurrent polarity reverses with excitation wavelength, gate voltage, or other conditions - is essential for optical logic, neuromorphic computing, and imaging. Unlike unipolar responses, bipolar behavior enables direct binary encoding and enhanced photodetection contrast. However, in conventional photoconductive or photovoltaic systems, the simultaneous and opposite-directional transport of electrons and holes often suppresses polarity switching. Recent self-powered Shockley-Ramo (SR) photoresponse in gapless materials also show only unipolar signals due to strong, irreversible electron-hole asymmetry. Here, we demonstrate for the first-time bipolar SR photoresponse in GaAs nanoconstriction devices by exploiting reversible electron-hole asymmetry. The longer carrier lifetimes in GaAs enable sub-diffusion-length control of carrier dynamics through geometry. By tuning photocarrier dynamics near the nanoconstriction for both majority electrons and minority holes, we modulate the SR response to exhibit dual polarities. At low excitation, photoelectrons dominate; as excitation increases, intervalley scattering populates higher-energy L-valleys, reducing electron contribution and leading to polarity reversal driven by the growing dominance of photoexcited holes. These results, supported by SR theory, show that nanoscale geometric engineering, together with the reversible electron-hole asymmetry, enables self-powered bipolar photocurrent responses, offering new routes toward advanced optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Trapping absorbing and non-absorbing aqueous particle using a universal 4-arm Laguerre-Gaussian mode light trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorbing aerosols, such as brown carbon (BrC) and absorbing secondary organic aerosols (SOA), has attracted broad interest due to their importance for climate and human health. The pronounced time-dependence of light absorption during aging renders the precise estimation of their impact on global warming difficult. Single particle studies of such aerosols would be very useful to better understand their aging in the atmosphere through processes such as photochemistry. However previously proposed optical traps cannot continuously trap particles whose absorption state changes from strongly absorbing to non-absorbing or vice versa. Some of the traps presented can isolate absorbing and non-absorbing particles, but require mechanical alignment of the trap depending on the strength of particle absorption. However, mechanical realignment is not compatible with continuous trapping and observation. Here, we introduce a flexible optical universal trap which does not require mechanical realignment. The versatility of the trap relies on four trapping beams - either vortex Laguerre- Gaussian (LG) or fundamental Gaussian beams - which are modulated with a spatial light modulator (SLM), The performance of the trap is demonstrated by trapping different types of absorbing and non-absorbing particles. We also show that the trap can be used to observe the photochemical reaction of aqueous droplets containing fulvic acid, a common component of BrC. Digital holography measurements demonstrate that the confinement of the particles in the trap can be controlled by changing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the LG beams. The study also shows that spectroscopy measurements, such as fluorescence and Raman scattering, are possible in all configurations of the proposed trap.</description>

      <title>Nanodomain poling unlocking backward nonlinear light generation in thin film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency conversion offers powerful capabilities for applications in telecommunications, signal processing, and computing. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising integrated photonics platform due to its strong electro-optic effect and second-order nonlinearity, which can be exploited through periodic poling. However, conventional poling techniques in x-cut TFLN are limited to minimum period sizes on the order of microns, preventing the efficient generation of interactions involving counter-propagating waves. Here we report scalable periodic poling of x-cut TFLN with periods down to 215 nm and realize devices for counter- and back-propagating phase matching. We estimate conversion efficiencies of 1474 $\%$/W/cm$^2$ and 45 $\%$/W/cm$^2$ respectively, and measuring sum frequency generation we confirm that the nonlinear generation takes place in the desired direction. We report spontaneous parametric down conversion for the counter-propagating and, for the first time, for a backward propagating device. This technological advance provides the control of domain geometry in TFLN with an unprecedented precision and leads into the generation of photon pairs with spatial and spectral properties tailored for quantum signal processing, quantum computing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Phase noise measurement of semiconductor optical amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel measurement method for the phase noise measurement of optical amplifiers, topologically similar to the Heterodyne Mach-Zehnder Interferometer but governed by different principles, and we report on the measurement of a fibered amplifier at 1.55 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength. The amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$ $\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower than the background of the setup. This sets an upper bound of the amplifier noise at $-32$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=1$ $\mathrm{Hz}$, which corresponds to a frequency stability of $5.2{\times}10^{-17}/\tau$ (Allan deviation), where $\tau$ is the integration time. Such noise level is lower than that of most Fabry-Perot cavity-stabilized lasers. These results are of interest in a wide range of applications including metrology, instrumentation, optical communications, or fiber links.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Low Index Contrast to Reduce the Polarization Anisotropy in One-Dimensional Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs) are widely used platforms for guiding, filtering, and enhancing light at the nanoscale. Traditionally, designs have favored high refractive index contrast to maximize the photonic band gap (PBG) size. Here, we demonstrate that low-index contrast systems offer a powerful and underexplored route to achieving improved optical functionalities. In particular, we show that low index contrast enables more closely aligned PBGs for transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations, allowing for broadband superposition of TE and TM Bloch Surface Waves (BSWs). As a demonstration of this functionality, we use this approach to design 1DPCs capable of generating planar superchiral fields for enhanced circular dichroism spectroscopy. To realize such structures, we use an automated design framework based on multi-objective genetic optimization. By comparing optimized designs in both high and low index contrast regimes, we find that low index contrast systems yield significantly greater overlap between the TE and TM BSW dispersion relations and exhibit a pronounced reduction in optical anisotropy - both of which contribute to enhanced optical chirality across the operational bandwidth. Furthermore, simulations reveal that these low index contrast structures offer improved robustness to fabrication tolerances and support a wider dynamic range of chiral analyte concentrations. In addition to their optical performance advantages, low-index contrast systems are naturally compatible with polymeric materials, which offer benefits such as low cost, sustainability, and mechanical flexibility. While this work focuses on mode alignment and its consequences for surface wave behavior, the underlying principles have broader implications for polarization-independent photonic technologies, including optical sensing, computing, and spectral filtering.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of the Transverse Optical Flux in Random Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the kinetic energy (or gradient norm) of an incident linearly polarised monochromatic wave propagating in correlated random media. We explore the optical flux transverse to the mean Poynting flux at the paraxial-nonparaxial (vectorial) transition along with vortex counting and identify universal features in the dynamics. The vortex number appears to increase with a cubic root for sufficiently small correlation length. Furthermore, a kink appears in nucleation rate at the position of maximum scintillation upon increasing correlation length. A driven steady state is reached due to the filtering of evanescent waves upon propagation. Finally, we present the spectrum of the incompressible kinetic energy and how it evolves from the paraxial case to that of a random field.</description>

      <title>Rapid and precise distance measurement using balanced cross-correlation of a single frequency-modulated electro-optic comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-rapid, high-precision distance metrology is critical for both advanced scientific research and practical applications. However, current light detection and ranging technologies struggle to simultaneously achieve high measurement speed, accuracy, and a large non-ambiguity range. Here, we present a time-of-flight optical ranging technique based on a repetition-frequency-modulated femtosecond electro-optic comb and balanced nonlinear cross-correlation detection. In this approach, a target distance is determined as an integer multiple of the comb repetition period. By rapidly sweeping the comb repetition frequency, we achieve absolute distance measurements within 500 ns and real-time displacement tracking at single-pulse resolution (corresponding to a refresh rate of 172 MHz). Furthermore, our system attains an ultimate ranging precision of 5 nm (with 0.3 s integration time). Our method uniquely integrates nanometer-scale precision, megahertz-level refresh rates, and a theoretically unlimited ambiguity range within a single platform, while also supporting multi-target detection. These advances pave the way for high-speed, high-precision ranging systems in emerging applications such as structural health monitoring, industrial manufacturing, and satellite formation flying.</description>

      <title>Natural Hyperbolicity of Hexagonal Boron Nitride in the Deep Ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic media enable unique optical phenomena including hyperlensing, negative refraction, enhanced photonic density of states (PDOS), and highly confined polaritons. While most hyperbolic media are artificially engineered metamaterials, certain natural materials with extreme anisotropy can exhibit hyperbolic dispersion. Here, we report the first observation of natural hyperbolic dispersion in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in the deep-ultraviolet (DUV) regime, induced by strong, anisotropic exciton resonances. Using imaging spectroscopic ellipsometry (ISE), we characterize the complex dielectric function along in-plane and out-of-plane directions down to 190 nm (6.53 eV), revealing a type-II hyperbolic window in the DUV regime. This hyperbolicity supports hyperbolic exciton polaritons (HEP) with high directionality and slow group velocity. Our findings establish hBN as a promising platform for nanophotonic applications in the technologically significant DUV spectral range.</description>

      <title>An ultra-slow optical centrifuge. I. Zero rotational acceleration by spectral focusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optical centrifuge is a laser pulse which enables controlled rotational excitation of molecules. Centrifuged molecules rotating with well-defined angular frequencies are ideal candidates to probe many-body quantum systems at the nanoscale. Because the interaction with the quantum environment increases the effective moment of inertia of the embedded molecular probes, the required rotational acceleration of the optical centrifuge must be lowered to accommodate adiabatic spinning. We demonstrate a new design of an optical centrifuge, based on the method of spectral focusing, which enables extremely low, down to zero, rotational accelerations. We discuss the potential of using such constant frequency centrifuge to investigate molecular rotation inside helium nanodroplets.</description>

      <title>Towards a fictitious magnetic field trap for both ground and Rydberg state $^{87}$Rb atoms via the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold Rydberg atoms, known for their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole interactions that lead to the Rydberg blockade phenomenon, are among the most promising platforms for quantum simulations, quantum computation and quantum networks. However, a major limitation to the performance of Rydberg atom-based platforms is dephasing, which can be caused by atomic motion within the trap. Here, we propose a trap for $^{87}$Rb cold atoms that confines both the electronic ground state and a Rydberg state, engineered to minimize the differential light shifts between the two states. This is achieved by combining a fictitious magnetic field induced by optical nanofibre guided light and an external bias magnetic field. We calculate trap potentials for the cases of one- and two-guided modes with quasi-linear and quasi-circular polarisations, and calculate trap depths and trap frequencies for different values of laser power and bias fields. Moreover, we discuss the impact of the quadrupole polarisability of the Rydberg atoms on the trap potential and demonstrate how the size of a Rydberg atom influences the ponderomotive potential generated by the nanofibre-guided light field. This work expands on the idea of light-induced fictitious magnetic field traps and presents a practical approach for creating quantum networks using Rydberg atoms integrated with optical nanofibres to generate 1D atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Equalized Hyperspin Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable simulation of spin models is of critical importance to tackle complex optimization problems that are intractable on conventional computing machines. The recently introduced hyperspin machine, which is a network of linearly and nonlinearly coupled parametric oscillators, provides a versatile simulator of general classical vector spin models in arbitrary dimension, finding the minimum of the simulated spin Hamiltonian and implementing novel annealing algorithms. In the hyperspin machine, oscillators evolve in time minimizing a cost function that must resemble the desired spin Hamiltonian in order for the system to reliably simulate the target spin model. This condition is met if the hyperspin amplitudes are equal in the steady state. Currently, no mechanism to enforce equal amplitudes exists. Here, we bridge this gap and introduce a method to simulate the hyperspin machine with equalized amplitudes in the steady state. We employ an additional network of oscillators (named equalizers) that connect to the hyperspin machine via an antisymmetric nonlinear coupling and equalize the hyperspin amplitudes. We demonstrate the performance of such an equalized hyperspin machine by large-scale numerical simulations up to $10000$ hyperspins. Compared to the hyperspin machine without equalization, we find that the equalized hyperspin machine (i) Reaches orders of magnitude lower spin energy, and (ii) Its performance is significantly less sensitive to the system parameters. The equalized hyperspin machine offers a competitive spin Hamiltonian minimizer and opens the possibility to combine amplitude equalization with complex annealing protocols to further boost the performance of spin machines.</description>

      <title>Harmonic generation of graphene quantum dots in Hartree-Fock approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots under linearly polarized optical pulses, focusing on excitonic effects. Combining the tight-binding model and the single-particle density matrix approach, we derive a semiconductor Bloch equation under a static-screened Hartree-Fock approximation. This framework characterizes the electron-electron interaction through local Hartree potentials for direct Coulomb interaction and nonlocal Fock potentials for exchange interaction. Distinct confgurations of Hartree and Fock terms yield various approximation methods, including independent-particle approximation, mean-feld approximation, random phase approximation, and excitonic effects. We thoroughly analyze how these approximation methods affect the electronic energy levels, linear optical absorption, and nonlinear harmonic generation. Within excitonic effects, we present the dependence of harmonic generation on the geometric variations of graphene quantum dots (sizes, triangular/hexagonal shapes, and armchair/zigzag edges) and the amplitude and polarization of electric fields. Our findings show that excitonic effects significantly enhance optical responses of graphene nanostructures. For a dot ensemble formed by randomly oriented graphene quantum dots,
  only odd-order harmonics exist along the polarization direction of the incident light. Crucially, harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots exhibits high tunability via geometric configuration, making them promising candidates for nonlinear optical nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Trap-to-trap free falls with an optically levitated nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform free-fall experiments with a charge-neutral, optically levitated nanoparticle. This is achieved using an optical tweezer that can be rapidly toggled on and off and vertically displaced, enabling the particle to be released and recaptured after each free fall. The particle is insensitive to electric fields due to its charge neutrality and, during free evolution, is not subject to photon recoil heating. We achieve free-fall durations of up to 0.25 ms and observe a nearly two hundred-fold increase in the particle's position uncertainty at recapture. The current limit on the free-fall time arises from the performance of the initial cooling step. By implementing linear feedback techniques and reducing the background pressure, we expect to perform millisecond-scale free-fall experiments in ultra-high vacuum, opening new opportunities for generating large delocalizations of levitated objects.</description>

      <title>Dark-state photonic entanglement filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preserving entanglement in the presence of decoherence remains a major challenge for quantum technologies. Recent proposals [M.A. Selim et al., Science 387, 1424 (2025)] have employed photonic filters based on anti-parity-time symmetry to recover certain entangled states, but these approaches require intricate, symmetry-constrained waveguide architectures and precise bath engineering. In this work, we show that such strict non-Hermitian symmetry constraints are not necessary for entanglement filtering. Instead, we identify post-selection and the emergence of dark states -- arising naturally through destructive interference in simple photonic settings -- as the essential mechanisms. By avoiding the need for special bath engineering or non-Hermitian symmetries, our approach significantly simplifies the design and architecture, enhances universality, and extends applicability beyond previously studied dimer configurations. We demonstrate this concept using minimal waveguide network designs, offering a broadly accessible route to robust entanglement filtering.</description>

      <title>Shannon Entropy Helps Optimize the Performance of a Frequency-Multiplexed Extreme Learning Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowing the dynamics of neuromorphic photonic schemes would allow their optimization for controlled data-processing capability in possibly simplified designs and minimized energy consumption levels. In nonlinear substrates such as optical fibers or semiconductors, these dynamics can widely vary depending on the encoded inputs, even for a single set of physical parameters. Thus, other approaches are required to optimize the schemes. Here, I consider a frequency-multiplexed Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) that encodes information in the line amplitudes of a frequency comb and processes this information in a single-mode fiber subject to Kerr nonlinearity. Its performance is evaluated with Iris and Breast Cancer Wisconsin classification datasets. I introduce the notions of Shannon entropy of optical power, phase, and spectrum and numerically show that the optimization of system parameters (continuous-wave laser optical power and the modulation depth of the subsequent phase modulator as well as the fiber group-velocity dispersion and length) yields the ELM performance that places this neuromorphic scheme among the top-performing state-of-the-art computer-based machine-learning models. I show that the ELM's performance is robust against initial noise, paving the way for cost-effective designs. Using Soliton Radiation Beat Analysis, I show that information encoding symmetric in frequency-comb lines yields the formation of input-power-dependent Akhmediev-breather-like structures and Peregrine solitons, whereas asymmetric encoding of the comb exhibits an additional regime of soliton crystals. Also, I discuss that asymmetric encoding supports the theory of Four-Wave Mixing as a data processing mechanism, whereas symmetric encoding underlines the theory of soliton-mediated information processing. The findings advance the toolbox and knowledge of Neuromorphic Photonics and general Nonlinear Optics.</description>

      <title>Inverse-designed dispersive time-varying nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying nanostructures allow us to control the spatial and temporal properties of light. The temporal modulation of the nanostructures constitutes an additional degree of freedom to control their scattering properties on demand and in a reconfigurable manner. However, these additional parameters create a vast design space, raising challenges in identifying optimal designs. Therefore, tools from the field of photonic inverse design must be used to optimize the degrees of freedom of the system to facilitate predefined optical responses. To further develop this field, here we introduce a differentiable transition (T-) matrix-based inverse design framework for dispersive time-varying nanostructures. The electron density of the material of the nanostructures is modulated non-adiabatically as a generic periodic function of time. Using the inverse design framework, the temporal shape of the electron density can be manipulated to reach the target functionality. Our computational framework is exploited, exemplarily, in two instances. First, the decay rate enhancement of oscillating dipoles near time-varying spheres is controlled on demand. Second, using spatiotemporal metasurfaces, a system supporting asymmetric transmission of light at visible frequencies is designed. Our work paves the way toward programmable spatiotemporal metasurfaces and space-time crystals for a future generation of reconfigurable functional photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmonic molecular nanojunctions exhibit opto-mechanical coupling at the nanoscale, enabling intertwined optical, vibrational and electronic phenomena. Here, we demonstrate plasmon-mediated phonon pumping, driven by inelastic electron hopping in conductive molecules, which results in strong Raman nonlinearity at the light intensities almost three orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional opto-mechanical systems and up to four-fold enhancement of the effective Raman polarizability due to vibrational electron-phonon coupling, as confirmed by the significant increase in anti-Stokes Raman scattering intensity, indicating enhanced vibrational occupancy. We also developed a microscopic framework of opto-mechanical electron-phonon coupling in molecular nanojunctions based on the Marcus electron hopping. Systematically varying electrical conductance of the molecules in the junction and laser intensity, we observed the transition between a photo-assisted tunneling regime and an electron hopping process. Our findings provide a microscopic description for vibrational, optical, and electronic phenomena in plasmonic nanocavities important for efficient phonon lasing, representing the first attempt to exploit conductive molecules as quantum-mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised super-spatial-resolution Brillouin frequency shift extraction based on physical enhanced spatial resolution neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial resolution (SR), a core parameter of Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) sensors, determines the minimum fiber length over which physical perturbations can be accurately detected. However, the phonon lifetime in the fiber imposes an inherent limit on the SR, making sub-meter-level SR challenging in high-SR monitoring scenarios. Conventional SR enhancement approaches, constrained by hardware limitations, often involve complex systems, or increased measurement times. Although traditional deconvolution methods can mitigate hardware constraints, they suffer from distortion due to the nonlinear nature of the BOTDA response. Supervised deep learning approaches have recently emerged as an alternative, offering faster and more accurate post-processing through data-driven models. However, the need for extensive labeled data and the lack of physical priors lead to high computational costs and limited generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose an unsupervised deep learning deconvolution framework, Physics-enhanced SR deep neural network (PSRN) guided by an approximate convolution model of the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS).</description>

      <title>From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double N\'eel ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image, underpinning diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover two universal geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. These mechanisms operate effectively even in amorphous chiral media under isotropic illumination and persist at weak spin-orbit coupling, underscoring fundamental aspects of spin-chirality interplay. We further identify an unreported phenomenon central to CISS: locking of photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. Our findings provide a unified geometric framework with broad implications, extending from CISS and asymmetric catalysis to spin textures in chiral crystals and chiral quantum materials such as Weyl semimetals.</description>

Abstract: Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum provide a highly sensitive platform for probing weak light-matter interactions. In this work, we present an interference-based method to amplify the optical force exerted by a weak field on a nanoscale particle trapped in an optical tweezer. By allowing the weak field to interfere with the strong trapping beam, we significantly enhance the optical force compared to the case without interference. This amplified optical force enables the detection of the weak field through the particle's motion, reaching picowatt-level sensitivity under moderate vacuum conditions. We further discuss the potential of this approach for developing an ultrasensitive, nondestructive detector of light fields and for exploring optomechanical interactions at the single-photon level.</description>

      <title>Electrically reconfigurable extended lasing state in an organic liquid-crystal microcavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small-footprint, low-power arrays of coupled coherent emitters with the capability of near- and far-field engineering and coherence control are highly sought after to meet modern nanophotonics evolving needs. Between existing solutions based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, phase masks in bulk traditional cavity-based systems, and lattices of exciton-polariton condensates, only the strongly light-matter coupled systems were shown to be capable of controlled on-chip interaction between the individual coherent states while often operating at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate electrically controlled in-plane interaction between optically reconfigurable spatially separated lasing states, operating at room temperature in the weak light-matter coupling regime. We show spatially extended coherent lasing state or "supermode" with wide-range micro-scale control of near-field, far-field and on-chip phase-locking tuning functionality. An extended lasing state appears due to near-field transverse coupling between distinct spatially pumped lasing states in the plane of an organic liquid crystal-filled microcavity. We realize electrical control over the interaction strength between lasing states and corresponding mutual coherence going beyond nearest neighbours through electrical tuning of the microcavity optical modes with external voltage, and a spin-selective directional coupling regime by using a photonic analogue of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical and electronic properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy conversion &amp; storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, spintronics and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum interference in integrated lithium niobate nanophotonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonics has emerged as one of the leading platforms for the implementation of real-world-applicable quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, enhanced sensing capabilities, as well as resolving previously intractable computational challenges. However, to harness the full potential of the photonics platform, several engineering feats need to be accomplished, among those is the quest for a scalable source of pure single photons. While single photon sources can be implemented in a variety of different ways, integrated lithium niobate stands out as a prime contender for a monolithic quantum photonics platform, given its second-order nonlinearity and proven classical scalability. Despite the extensive effort put into developing the platform, integrating suitable photon pair sources remains a hurdle limiting the scalability of quantum photonic systems in lithium niobate. We engineer three-wave-mixing in a nanophotonic lithium niobate device, integrating multiple near-perfect spectrally separable heralded single photon sources. By mixing photons generated via the developed sources, we show bosonic interference between indistinguishable photons, a crucial interaction for many photonic quantum computing protocols. This demonstration of the first proof-of-principle multi-source interference in integrated lithium niobate contributes to developing a truly scalable quantum photonics platform.</description>
