      <title>The Distributional Koopman Operator for Random Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Distributional Koopman Operator (DKO) is introduced as a way to perform Koopman analysis on random dynamical systems where only aggregate distribution data is available, thereby eliminating the need for particle tracking or detailed trajectory data. Our DKO generalizes the stochastic Koopman operator (SKO) to allow for observables of probability distributions, using the transfer operator to propagate these probability distributions forward in time. Like the SKO, the DKO is linear with semigroup properties, and we show that the dynamical mode decomposition (DMD) approximation can converge to the DKO in the large data limit. The DKO is particularly useful for random dynamical systems where trajectory information is unavailable.</description>

      <title>Tilings from Tops of Overlapping Iterated Function Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The top of the attractor $A$ of a hyperbolic iterated function system $\left\{ f_{i}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}|i=1,2,\dots,M\right\} $ is defined and used to extend self-similar tilings to overlapping systems. The theory interprets expressions of the form $\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}f_{j_{1}}^{-1}f_{j_{2}}^{-1}\dots f_{j_{k}} ^{-1}(\left\{ top(f_{i_{1}}f_{i_{2}}\dots f_{i_{k+1}}(A))|i_{1}i_{2}\dots i_{k+1}\in\{1,2,\dots,M\}^{k+1}\right\} )$ to yield tilings of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Examples include systems of finite type, tilings related to aperiodic monotiles, and ones where there are infinitely many distinct but related prototiles.</description>

      <title>Wandering Flows on the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11751v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study planar flows without non-wandering points and prove several properties of these flows in relation with their prolongational relation. The main results of this article are that a planar (regular) wandering flow has no generalized recurrence and has only two topological invariants: the space of its orbits and its prolongational relation (or, equivalently, its smallest stream). As a byproduct, our results show that, even in absence of any type of recurrence, the stream of a flow contains fundamental information on its behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the outer length billiard dynamics, acting on the exterior of a strictly-convex planar domain. We first show that ellipses are totally integrable. We then provide an explicit representation of first order terms for the formal Taylor expansion of the corresponding Mather's $\beta$-function. Finally, we provide explicit Lazutkin coordinates up to order 4.</description>

      <title>Mixed-feedback oscillations in the foraging dynamics of arboreal turtle ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a model for the dynamics of the flow into and out of a nest for the arboreal turtle ant $\textit{Cephalotes goniodontus}$ during foraging to investigate a possible mechanism for the emergence of oscillations. In our model, there is mixed dynamic feedback between the flow of ants between different behavioral compartments and the concentration of pheromone along trails. On one hand, the ants deposit pheromone along the trail, which provides a positive feedback by increasing rates of return to the nest. On the other hand, pheromone evaporation is a source of negative feedback, as it depletes the pheromone and inhibits the return rate. We prove that the model is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of pheromone feedback. Then we show that pheromone feedback can lead to a loss of stability of the equilibrium and onset of sustained oscillations in the flow in and out of the nest via a Hopf bifurcation. This analysis sheds light on a potential key mechanism that enables arboreal turtle ants to effectively optimize their trail networks to minimize traveled path lengths and eliminate graph cycles.</description>

      <title>Provably Safe Control for Constrained Nonlinear Systems with Bounded Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world control applications, actuator constraints and output constraints (specifically in tracking problems) are inherent and critical to ensuring safe and reliable operation. However, generally, control strategies often neglect these physical limitations, leading to potential instability, degraded performance, or even system failure when deployed on real-world systems. This paper addresses the control design problem for a class of nonlinear systems under both actuator saturation and output constraints. First, a smooth asymmetric saturation model (a more generic representative of practical scenarios) is proposed to model actuator saturation, which ensures that the control inputs always remain confined within a predefined set to ensure safety. Based on the proposed model, we develop a nonlinear control framework that guarantees output tracking while ensuring that system output remains confined to the predefined set. Later, we integrate this design with the constrained output tracking control problem, wherein we show that the system output tracks its desired trajectory by simultaneously satisfying input and output constraints. The global stabilization of the tracking error is achieved in the presence of input constraints, while semi-global stabilization is achieved in the presence of both input and output constraints. Additionally, we rigorously establish the boundedness of all closed-loop signals under the proposed design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in handling asymmetric constraints while achieving desirable tracking performance.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.</description>

      <title>Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{L}^1$ full groups of flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.09009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full group associated with a measure-preserving action of a Polish normed group on a standard probability space. These groups carry a natural Polish group topology induced by an $\mathrm{L}^1$ norm. Our construction generalizes $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups of actions of discrete groups, which have been studied recently by the first author.
  We show that under minor assumptions on the actions, topological derived subgroups of $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups are topologically simple and -- when the acting group is locally compact and amenable -- are whirly amenable and generically two-generated. $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups of actions of compactly generated locally compact Polish groups are shown to remember the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ orbit equivalence class of the action.
  For measure-preserving actions of the real line (also often called measure-preserving flows), the topological derived subgroup of an $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups is shown to coincide with the kernel of the index map, which implies that $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups of free measure-preserving flows are topologically finitely generated if and only if the flow admits finitely many ergodic components. We also prove a reconstruction-type result: the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full group completely characterizes the associated ergodic flow up to flip Kakutani equivalence.
  Finally, we study the coarse geometry of the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full groups. The $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ norm on the derived subgroup of the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full group of an aperiodic action of a locally compact amenable group is proved to be maximal in the sense of C. Rosendal. For measure-preserving flows, this holds for the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ norm on all of the $\mathrm{L}^{1}$ full group.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles has the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$, defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$, is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts, since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$, and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Appeals to randomness in various number-theoretic constructions appear regularly in modern scientific publications. Such famous names as V.I. Arnold, M. Katz, Ya.G. Sinai, and T. Tao are just a few examples. Unfortunately, all of these approaches rely on various, although often very non-trivial and elegant, heuristics. A new analytical approach is proposed to address the issue of randomness/complexity of an individual deterministic sequence. This approach demonstrates the expected high complexity of quadratic residues and the unexpectedly low complexity in the case of prime numbers. Technically, our approach is based on a new construction of the dynamical entropy of a single trajectory, which measures its complexity, in contrast to classical Kolmogorov-Sinai and topological entropies, which measure the complexity of the entire dynamical system.</description>

Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian systems provide a powerful tool for modeling physical systems. Their energy-based perspective allows for the coupling of various subsystems through energy exchange. Another important class of systems, passive systems, are characterized by their inability to generate energy internally. In this paper, we investigate the equivalence between passivity and the feasibility of port-Hamiltonian realizations in nonlinear systems, thereby elaborating upon previous results from [McLachlan et al., 1999, Ortega et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2003]. Based on our findings, we present a method to construct port-Hamiltonian representations of a passive system if the dynamics and the Hamiltonian are known.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Equilibrium and Freezing States in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with freezing phase transitions in general dynamical systems. A freezing phase transition is one in which, for a given potential $\phi$, there exists some inverse temperature $\beta_0 &gt; 0$ such that for all $\alpha, \beta &gt; \beta_0$, the collection of equilibrium states for $\alpha \phi$ and $\beta \phi$ coincide. In this sense, below the temperature $1 / \beta_0$, the system "freezes" on a fixed collection of equilibrium states.
  We show that for a given invariant measure $\mu$, it is no more restrictive that $\mu$ is the freezing state for some potential than it is for $\mu$ to be the equilibrium state for some potential. In fact, our main result applies to any collection of equilibrium states with the same entropy. In the case where the entropy map $h$ is upper semi-continuous, we show any ergodic measure $\mu$ can be obtained as a freezing state for some potential.
  In this upper semi-continuous setting, we additionally show that the collection of potentials that freeze at a single state is dense in the space of all potentials. However, in the $\Z$ action setting where the dynamical system satisfies specification, the collection of potentials that do not freeze contains a dense $G_\delta$.</description>

      <title>Independence and mean sensitivity in minimal systems under group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study the relation between regularity, independence and mean sensitivity for minimal systems. In the first part, we show that if a minimal system is incontractible, or local Bronstein with an invariant Borel probability measure, then the regularity is strictly bounded by the infinite independence. In particular, the following two types of minimal systems are applicable to our result: (1) The acting group of the minimal system is a virtually nilpotent group. (2) The minimal system is a proximal extension of its maximal equicontinuous factor and admits an invariant Borel probability measure. Items (1) and (2) correspond to Conjectures 1 and 2 from Huang, Lian, Shao, and Ye (J. Funct. Anal., 2021); item (1) verifies Conjecture 1 in the virtually nilpotent case, and item (2) gives an affirmative answer to Conjecture 2.
  In the second part, for a minimal system acting by an amenable group, under the local Bronstein condition, we establish parallel results regarding weak mean sensitivity and establish that every mean-sensitive tuple is an IT-tuple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem. Our proof reveals the natural relationships among infinite sumsets, the dynamics underpinning arithmetic progressions, and homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Artificial Potential Fields and Reciprocal Control Barrier Function-based Safety Filters</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that controllers designed by artificial potential fields (APFs) can be derived from reciprocal control barrier function quadratic program (RCBF-QP) safety filters. By integrating APFs within the RCBF-QP framework, we explicitly establish the relationship between these two approaches. Specifically, we first introduce the concepts of tightened control Lyapunov functions (T-CLFs) and tightened reciprocal control barrier functions (T-RCBFs), each of which incorporates a flexible auxiliary function. We then utilize an attractive potential field as a T-CLF to guide the nominal controller design, and a repulsive potential field as a T-RCBF to formulate an RCBF-QP safety filter. With appropriately chosen auxiliary functions, we show that controllers designed by APFs and those derived by RCBF-QP safety filters are equivalent. Based on this insight, we further generalize the APF-based controllers (equivalently, RCBF-QP safety filter-based controllers) to more general scenarios without restricting the choice of auxiliary functions. Finally, we present a collision avoidance example to clearly illustrate the connection and equivalence between the two methods.</description>

      <title>Some mathematical models for flagellar activation mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying a model for molecular motors responsible for the bending of the axoneme in the flagella of microorganisms. The model is a coupled system of partial differential equations inspired by J\"ulicher et al. or Camalet, incorporating two rows of molecular motors between microtubules filaments. Existence and uniqueness of a solution is proved, together with the presence of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Additionally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results. A brief study on the generalization to N-rows is also included.</description>

      <title>POD-Galerkin Reduced Order Modeling of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling (ROM) aims to mitigate computational complexity by reducing the size of a high-dimensional state space. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin ROM when applied to the El Nino Southern Oscillation model, which integrates coupled atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature (SST) mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific. While POD identifies the most energetic modes of a system from simulation data, the Galerkin projection maps the governing equations onto these reduced modes to derive a simplified dynamical system. Leveraging the unique coupling properties of the model, we propose a novel approach to formulate a reduced order model derived from Galerkin projection. Our approach achieves remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only four POD modes. The results provide highly stable and accurate solutions over 95% compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM), highlighting the potential of POD-Galerkin reduction for efficient and accurate climate simulations.</description>
