      <title>Stability analysis of time-periodic shear flow generated by an oscillating density interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the conceptual two-layered oscillating tank of Inoue &amp; Smyth (2009), which mimics the time-periodic parallel shear flow generated by low-frequency (e.g. semi-diurnal tides) and small-angle oscillations of the density interface. Such self-induced shear of an oscillating pycnocline may provide an alternate pathway to pycnocline turbulence and diapycnal mixing in addition to the turbulence and mixing driven by wind-induced shear of the surface mixed layer. We theoretically investigate shear instabilities arising in the inviscid two-layered oscillating tank configuration and show that the equation governing the evolution of linear perturbations on the density interface is a Schr\"odinger-type ordinary differential equation with a periodic potential. The necessary and sufficient stability condition is governed by a nondimensional parameter $\beta$ resembling the inverse Richardson number; for two layers of equal thickness, instability arises when $\beta\!&gt;\!1/4$. When this condition is satisfied, the flow is initially stable but finally tunnels into the unstable region after reaching the time marking the turning point. Once unstable, perturbations grow exponentially and reveal characteristics of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. The Modified Airy Function method, which is an improved variant of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) theory, is implemented to obtain a uniformly valid, composite approximate solution to the interface evolution. Next, we analyse the fully nonlinear stages of interface evolution by modifying the circulation evolution equation in the standard vortex blob method, which reveals that the interface rolls up into KH billows. Finally, we undertake real case studies of Lake Geneva and Chesapeake Bay to provide a physical perspective.</description>

      <title>Non-coalescence and in-plane momentum generation in sessile droplet clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intuitively, droplets in proximity merge when brought into contact. However, under certain conditions, they may not coalesce due to the entrapment of an interstitial gas film. Droplet non-coalescence has so far been observed in various scenarios, such as during interactions between droplets moving with relative bulk velocity, droplets with opposite charges and size differences, and Leidenfrost droplets due to continuous vapor generation. Although non-coalescence has been reported for droplets of various fluids and sizes, non-coalescence for water droplets has been reported only for grazing collisions of large droplets (diameter &gt;2 mm) moving with high bulk velocity. Here, we report non-coalescence between water droplets over a wide range of droplet diameters, without the presence of any charges, surfactants, fluid property gradients, any additional vapor generation, or bulk droplet velocities. Such non-coalescence manifests in sessile droplet clusters on water repellant surfaces. When any two droplets in a cluster coalesce, they do not necessarily trigger further coalescence with other neighbouring droplets in the cluster. Further, depending on the initial geometric arrangement of droplets, such non-coalescence results in significant lateral momentum generation and consequently, spontaneous in-plane self-propulsion of participating droplets. The energy conversion efficiency of this process reaches as high as 9% for most closely packed clusters of 3 droplets and increases further with increase in the number of participating droplets. Further, this phenomenon can manifest for droplets as small as 200 {\mu}m in diameter formed during condensation. The resulting self-propulsion of such small droplets reveals a new pathway for passive droplet removal and surface renewal during dropwise condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces, critical in multiple applications.</description>

      <title>A model of heat transfer from a cylinder in high-speed slip flow and determination of temperature jump coefficients using hot-wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In small-scale, low-density or high-speed flows, the mean free path of the gas and its molecular interaction with a solid interface are key properties for the analysis of heat transfer mechanisms occurring in many flow processes ranging from micro-scale to aerospace applications. Here, we specifically examine the effects of temperature jump at the gas-solid interface on the convection from a cylinder in the high-speed slip flow regime. By employing the classical Smoluchowski temperature jump condition, we derive a simple model that explicitly predicts the heat flux (Nusselt number $\text{Nu}$) from the surface of a small heated cylinder simulating a hot-wire as a function of the Knudsen number ($\text{Kn}$) and the thermal (or energy) accommodation coefficient ($\sigma_T$) of the gas molecules interacting with the surface. The model, derived analytically and verified empirically by numerical simulations, helps clarifying coupled gas rarefaction and temperature effects on the heat transfer from a cylinder in high-speed flow. In addition, we employ the model reversely to propose a novel methodology to compute gas-surface thermal accommodation or temperature jump coefficients from hot-wire measurements.</description>

      <title>Modeling flying formations as flow-mediated matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective locomotion of swimming and flying animals is fascinating in terms of individual-level fluid mechanics and group-level structure and dynamics. Here we bridge and relate these scales through a model of formation flight that views the collective as a material whose properties arise from the flow-mediated interactions among its members. We build on and revise an aerodynamic model describing how flapping flyers produce vortex wakes and how they are forced by others' wakes. While simplistic, the model faithfully reproduces a series of physical experiments carried out over the last decade on pairwise interactions of flapping foils. By studying longer in-line arrays, we show that the group behaves as a soft "crystal" with regularly spaced member "atoms" whose positioning is, however, susceptible to deformations and dynamical instabilities. Poking or wiggling a member excites longitudinal waves (flow-mediated phonons, or "flonons") that pass down the group while growing in amplitude, and indeed the internal excitation from flapping is sufficient to trigger instabilities. Linear analysis of the model explains the aerodynamic origin of the lattice spacing, the springiness of the "bonds" between flyers, and the tendency for disturbances to resonantly amplify. Other properties such as the timescales for instability growth and wave propagation seem to involve the full nonlinear behavior. These findings suggest intriguing analogies with physical materials that could be generally useful for understanding and analyzing animal groups. Several properties displayed by our system seem particularly relevant to biological collectives, namely group cohesion and organization, sensitive detection of and response to perturbations, and transmission of information through traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Bistability in radiatively heated melt ponds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melting and solidification processes, intertwined with convective flows, play a fundamental role in geophysical contexts. One of these processes is the formation of melt ponds on glaciers, ice shelves, and sea ice. It is driven by solar radiation and is of great significance for the Earth's heat balance, as it significantly lowers the albedo. Through direct numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we unveil a bistability phenomenon in the melt pond dynamics. As solar radiation intensity and the melt pond's initial depth vary, an abrupt transition occurs: This tipping point transforms the system from a stable fully frozen state to another stable equilibrium state, characterized by a distinct melt pond depth. The physics of this transition can be understood within a heat flux balance model, which exhibits excellent agreement with our numerical results. Together with the Grossmann-Lohse theory for internally heated convection, the model correctly predicts the bulk temperature and the flow strength within the melt ponds, offering insight into the coupling of phase transitions with adjacent turbulent flows and the interplay between convective melting and radiation-driven processes.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Korteweg-de Vries Equation for Internal Solitary Wave Problem: Forward Simulation and Inverse Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a transformative framework for addressing operator learning and inverse problems involving the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for internal solitary waves. By integrating physical constraints with data-driven optimization, PINNs overcome the critical challenges of parameter unmeasurability in the KdV equation for internal solitary waves in two-layer fluid systems. This work addresses two problems: (1) Operator learning constructs a mapping from parameters to solutions, enabling wave evolution predictions from unknown parameters. Comparative studies demonstrate prediction errors as low as $10^{-4}$ when using 1000 training points. (2) Inverse problem solving leverages sparse and potentially noisy observational data with physics-regularized constraints to invert nonlinear coefficients successfully. Compared to conventional approaches, this end-to-end differentiable paradigm unifies operator learning and inverse problem-solving while overcoming mesh discretization errors and high-dimensional parameter space iteration costs. The method shows effectiveness for internal wave problems in stratified fluids, providing both accurate forward modeling and robust parameter inversion capabilities, even under noise.</description>

      <title>Turbulent stretching of dumbbells with hydrodynamic interactions: an analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stretching of an elastic dumbbell in a turbulent flow, with the aim of understanding and quantifying the effect of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between the beads of the dumbbell. Adopting the Batchelor-Kraichnan model for the flow, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation and solve it analytically to obtain the probability distribution of the dumbbell's extension. Using different formulations of the HI tensor, we find that HI preferentially enhances the stretching of stiff dumbbells, i.e., those with a small Weissenberg number. We also evaluate the averaging approximations commonly used to simplify the description of HI effects; the consistently-averaged approximation shows that HI result in a less-pronounced coil-stretch transition in chaotic flows. Finally, we confirm the relevance of our analytical results by a comparison with Brownian dynamics simulations of dumbbells transported in a direct numerical simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of the flow in a coflowing device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stability of the coflow configuration. The experiments and the global stability analysis show that the emitted jet always destabilizes before the tapering conical meniscus. This implies that the parameter conditions at which polydisperse dripping arises cannot be determined from the linear stability analysis of the steady jetting mode. Transient simulations show that the linear superposition of decaying eigenmodes triggered by an initial perturbation can lead to the jet breakup. The breakup process significantly depends on the initial perturbation. These results question the validity of the linear stability analysis as applied to the coflowing and other similar configurations.</description>

      <title>A simple and efficient second-order immersed-boundary method for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An immersed-boundary method for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations is presented. It employs discrete forcing for a sharp discrimination of the solid-fluid interface, and achieves second-order accuracy, demonstrated in examples with highly complex three-dimensional geometries. The method is implicit, meaning that the point in the solid which is nearest to the interface is accounted for implicitly, which benefits stability and convergence properties; the correction is also implicit in time (without requiring a matrix inversion), although the temporal integration scheme is fully explicit. The method stands out for its simplicity and efficiency: when implemented alongside second-order finite differences, only the weight of the center point of the Laplacian stencil in the momentum equation is modified, and no corrections for the continuity equation and the pressure are required. The immersed-boundary method, its performance and its accuracy are first verified on simple problems, and then put to test on a simple laminar, two-dimensional flow and on two more complex examples: the turbulent flow in a channel with a sinusoidal wall, and the flow in a human nasal cavity, whose extreme anatomical complexity mandates an accurate treatment of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression-Enhanced Dynamic Wake Meandering: Fast and Physically Consistent Wind-Turbine Wake Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling wind turbine wakes is essential for optimizing wind farm performance but remains a persistent challenge. While the dynamic wake meandering (DWM) model captures unsteady wake behavior, it suffers from near-wake inaccuracies due to empirical closures. We propose a Symbolic Regression-enhanced DWM (SRDWM) framework that achieves equation-level closure by embedding symbolic expressions for volumetric forcing and boundary terms explicitly into governing equations. These physically consistent expressions are discovered from LES data using symbolic regression guided by a hierarchical, domain-informed decomposition strategy. A revised wake-added turbulence formulation is further introduced to enhance turbulence intensity predictions. Extensive validation across varying inflows shows that SRDWM accurately reproduces both mean wake characteristics and turbulent dynamics, achieving full spatiotemporal resolution with over three orders of magnitude speedup compared to LES. The results highlight symbolic regression as a bridge between data and physics, enabling interpretable and generalizable modeling.</description>

      <title>Versatile SPH Open Boundary Conditions for Multiphase Flows in Extreme Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method has been demonstrated as a promising numerical solver for multiphase flow problems due to its Lagrangian nature, its application to complex channel flow may encounter additional issues such as the open boundary condition and numerical instability in the extreme flow state. The present work aims to establish a general SPH algorithm for accurate and stable simulation of complex multiphase flows in configurations with open boundaries. The general scheme of weakly compressible SPH is adopted with special treatments implemented to ease the numerical oscillation in the density discontinuity scenario, and the turbulent model is implemented for interpretations of extreme flow conditions in high Reynolds numbers. Then, the conventional open boundary condition is fine-tuned by two new algorithms to guarantee the numerical stability in the inflow and the outflow regions. Firstly, a density relaxation is proposed to alleviate the pressure instability in the inflow region, which improves the smoothness of the particle pre-processing procedure. Secondly, the particle shifting technique with adaptive damper is implemented to adjust the magnitude of correction in the outflow region, which helps to suppress the velocity oscillation near the outlet. Validations of the proposed algorithms are carried out through four classic numerical examples, presenting appealing agreements with the analytical solutions and thus demonstrating the versatility in various flow conditions. Then, the robustness of the method is established through the turbulent multiphase channel flow cases and the horizontal slug channel flow with large density ratios. These results shed light on the value of the proposed algorithm as a general solver for complex multiphase flow problems with open boundaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted tracer dispersion in turbulent shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum-assisted generative algorithm for synthetic tracks of Lagrangian tracer particles in a turbulent shear flow. The parallelism and sampling properties of quantum algorithms are used to build and optimize a parametric quantum circuit, which generates a quantum state that corresponds to the joint probability density function of the classical turbulent velocity components, p(u_1^{\prime}, u_2^{\prime}, u_3^{\prime}). Velocity samples are drawn by one-shot measurements on the quantum circuit. The hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is validated with two classical methods, a standard stochastic Lagrangian model and a classical sampling scheme in the form of a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach. We consider a homogeneous turbulent shear flow with a constant shear rate S as a proof of concept for which the velocity fluctuations are Gaussian. The generation of the joint probability density function is also tested on a real quantum device, the 20-qubit IQM Resonance quantum computing platform for cases of up to 10 qubits. Our study paves the way to applications of Lagrangian small-scale parameterizations of turbulent transport in complex turbulent flows by quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Prediction of High Explosive Induced Fluid Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater explosions produce complex fluid phenomena relevant to diverse applications including maritime engineering, medical therapeutics, and inertial confinement fusion. These systems exhibit multiphase flows, chemical kinetics, and highly compressible dynamics that challenge traditional computational approaches. Current hydrodynamic solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and non-differentiable, limiting their use in design optimization and real-time applications. Here we show that deep neural networks can predict underwater explosion-induced fluid dynamics 4,025 times faster than traditional solvers while maintaining mean absolute percent errors below 0.005\% across all fluid state variables. Our approach maps from explosive material thermodynamic parameters to the temporal evolution of shock fronts and material interfaces, enabling rapid prediction of system behavior for a broad range of ideal explosive materials. Feature importance analysis reveals that exponential decay parameters of the explosive equation of state are the primary drivers of system dynamics, uncovering a previously unknown relationship between thermodynamic compatibility and energy transfer efficiency at material interfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate an inverse design framework that leverages the differentiability of our neural surrogate to perform parameter discovery, recovering unknown explosive material properties to within 1\% accuracy through gradient-based optimization. This combination of rapid inference, physical insight, and inverse design capabilities provides a route to engineering controlled fluid behavior in underwater explosive systems through material design. We anticipate our approach could enable new applications in defense systems, underwater manufacturing, and medical procedures where precise control of shock waves and bubble dynamics is essential.</description>

      <title>Triangular instability of a strained Batchelor vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the triangular instability of a Batchelor vortex subjected to a stationary triangular strain field generated by three satellite vortices, in the presence of weak axial flow. The analysis combines theoretical predictions with numerical simulations. Theoretically, the instability arises from resonant coupling between two quasi-neutral Kelvin modes with azimuthal wavenumbers $m$ and $m+3$ with the background strain. Numerically, we solve the linearized Navier-Stokes equations around a quasi-steady base flow to identify the most unstable modes, and compare their growth rates and frequencies with theoretical predictions for a Reynolds number $Re = 10^4$ and a straining strength $\epsilon = 0.008$. In the absence of axial flow, only the mode pair $(m_A, m_B) = (-1,2)$ (and its symmetric counterpart) is unstable. However, we show that additional combinations such as $(0,3)$, $(1,4)$, and $(2,5)$, which are otherwise strongly damped by the critical layer in the absence of axial flow, also become unstable once axial flow exceeds a certain threshold, as the critical layer damping is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we show that the most unstable mode in the no-axial-flow case, originating from the second branch of $m = -1$ and the first branch of $m = 2$, becomes less unstable as axial flow increases. It is eventually overtaken by a mode from the first branches of both wavenumbers, which then remains the dominant unstable mode across a wide range of axial flow strengths and Reynolds numbers. A comprehensive instability diagram as a function of the axial flow parameter is presented.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulations of inhalation in a 23-generation lung model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The air flows in the proximal and distal portions of the human lungs are interconnected: the lower Reynolds number in the deeper generations causes a progressive flow regularization, while mass conservation requires flow rate oscillations to propagate through the airway bifurcations. To explain how these two competing effects shape the flow state in the deeper generations, we have performed the first high-fidelity numerical simulations of the air flow in a lung model including 23 successive bifurcations of a single planar airway. Turbulence modelling or assumptions on flow regimes are not required. The chosen flow rate is stationary (steady on average), and representative of the peak inspiratory flow reached by adult patients breathing through therapeutical inhalers. As expected, advection becomes progressively less important after each bifurcation, until a time-dependent Stokes regime governed solely by viscous diffusion is established in the smallest generations. However, fluctuations in this regime are relatively fast and large with respect to the mean flow, which is in contrast with the commonly agreed picture that only the breathing frequency is relevant at the scale of the alveoli. We demonstrate that the characteristic frequency and amplitude of these fluctuations are linked to the flow in the upper part of the bronchial tree, as they originate from the time-dependent flow splitting in the upper bifurcations. Even though these fluctuations are observed here in an idealized, rigid lung model, our findings suggest that the assumptions usually adopted in many of the current lung models might need to be revised.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of n-Hexane Pyrolysis with an Optimized Kinetic Mechanism in a Hydrogen Plasma Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physicochemical mechanisms underlying the pyrolysis of n-hexane in a high temperature Ar-H2 environment were investigated for plasma pyrolysis process. An optimal chemical kinetics model was developed using the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), an automated tool for constructing reaction mechanisms. This model was validated through 0-D analyses, where simulation result were compared with existing kinetic models (LLNL,JetSurf) and experimental data from conventional n-hexane pyrolysis. Subsequently, 1-D analysis were conducted to identify the optimal operational flow rate in plasma pyrolysis reactor, the results of which informed detailed three-dimensional (2-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the plasma reactor. The CFD simulations reveal that fluid mixing dynamics play a dominant role in determining the extent of conversion and product selectivity, highlighting the limitations of lower-dimensional models in capturing essential transport phenomena. Notably, the simulations indicate a higher C2 monomer selectivity of approximately 50 % under plasma-based n-hexane pyrolysis, in contrast to the roughly 30 % selectivity achieved via conventional fossil-fuel-based methods. These findings underscore the potential advantages of plasma-driven pyrolysis and represent a critical step toward a comprehensive understanding of the complex thermochemical behavior governing plasma-assisted processes.</description>

      <title>Higher-Oder Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. We compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) the extension of the dual splitting method originally proposed by G.E. Karniadakis et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 97, 414-443, 1991) towards non-constant viscosity, ii) a higher-order DG method for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, iii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iv) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

      <title>Modelling two-dimensional droplet rebound off deep fluid baths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order for a droplet to rebound rather than coalesce with a liquid bath, a layer of gas must persist throughout the impact. This gas, typically an air layer acts as a lubricant to the system and permits a pressure transfer between the two liquid bodies. Through considering separately the bath, air, and drop regions of fluid, we introduce a fully coupled reduced dynamic model of two-dimensional droplets (i.e. cylindrical geometry) rebounding off liquid baths, which incorporates an evolving lubricating air layer. Numerical solutions of the lubrication-mediated model are compared to dedicated direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. The reduced model captures rebounding dynamics well in the regime where it is most relevant: for low-speed impacts of small droplets, where capillary forces are important. Numerically, the reduced model is efficient, allowing for the computation of multiple rebounds and of long time dynamics of droplets rebounding on a vibrating bath. Furthermore, the lubrication-mediated model is able to provide detailed information within the air layer such as pressure and lubrication-layer geometry, which is usually omitted from reduced models.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Second-Order Transport Models for Transition-Continuum Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling transition-continuum hypersonic flows poses significant challenges due to thermodynamic nonequilibrium and the associated breakdown of the continuum assumption. Standard continuum models such as the Navier-Stokes equations are inaccurate for these flows, and molecular models can be inefficient due to the large number of computational particles required at moderately high densities. We explore computational modeling of transition-continuum flows using a second-order constitutive theory that provides closures for the terms representing the molecular transport of momentum and energy. We optimize the second-order model parameters for one-dimensional viscous shocks using an adjoint-based optimization method, with the objective function comprising the primitive flow variables. Target data is obtained from moments of distribution functions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation. We compare results using optimized second-order models, the unoptimized second-order model, and the first-order Navier-Stokes model for Mach numbers $M\in[1.1,10]$ and observe improvements to the shock profiles and shock thickness calculations. We validate the optimized models by comparing the predicted viscous stress and heat flux, which are not included in the objective function, to those obtained by integrating the distribution function. The close match to these moments indicates that the satisfactory performance of the optimized second-order models is consistent with the nonequilibrium flow physics.</description>

      <title>How far does the influence of the free surface extend in turbulent open channel flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent open channel flow is known to feature a multi-layer structure near the free surface. In the present work we employ direct numerical simulations considering Reynolds numbers up to $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=900$ and domain sizes large enough ($L_x=12 \pi h$, $L_z=4 \pi h$) to faithfully capture the effect of very-large-scale motions in order to test the proposed scaling laws and ultimately answer the question: How far does the influence of the free surface extend? In the region near the free surface, where fluctuation intensities of velocity and vorticity become highly anisotropic, we observe the previously documented triple-layer structure, consisting of a wall-normal velocity damping layer that scales with the channel height $h$, and two sublayers that scale with the near-surface viscous length scale $\ell_V=\mathrm{Re}_b^{-1/2}h$ and with the Kolmogorov length scale $\ell_K=\mathrm{Re}_b^{-3/4}h$, respectively. The Kolmogorov sublayer measures $\delta_K \approx 20 \ell_K$ and the layer, where the wall-normal turbulence intensity decreases linearly to zero near the free surface, scales with $\ell_V$ and the corresponding near-surface viscous sublayer measures $\delta_V \approx \ell_V$. Importantly, the streamwise turbulence intensity profile for $\mathrm{Re}_\tau \ge 400$ suggests that the influence of the free-slip boundary penetrates essentially all the way down to the solid wall through the appearance of enhanced very-large-scale motions ($\delta_{SIL}\approx h$). In contrast, the layer where the surface-normal turbulence intensity is damped to zero is restricted to the free surface ($\delta_{NVD}\approx 0.3h$). As a consequence, the partitioning of the surface-influenced region has to be expanded to a four-layer structure that spans the entire channel height $h$.</description>

      <title>Dual guidance: ROM-informed field reconstruction with generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dual-guided framework for reconstructing unsteady incompressible flow fields using sparse observations. The approach combines optimized sensor placement with a physics-informed guided generative model. Sensor locations are selected using mutual information theory applied to a reduced-order model of the flow, enabling efficient identification of high-information observation points with minimal computational cost. These sensors, once selected, provide targeted observations that guide a denoising diffusion probabilistic model conditioned by physical constraints. Extensive experiments on 2D laminar cylinder wake flows demonstrate that under sparse sensing conditions, the structured sensor layouts fail to capture key flow dynamics, yielding high reconstruction errors. In contrast, our optimized sensor placement strategy achieves accurate reconstructions with L2 errors as low as 0.05, even with a limited number of sensors, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach in data-limited regimes. When the number of sensors is higher than a threshold, however, both methods perform comparably. Our dual-guided approach bridges reduced order model-based sensor position optimization with modern generative modeling, providing accurate, physics-consistent reconstruction from sparse data for scientific machine-learning problems.</description>
