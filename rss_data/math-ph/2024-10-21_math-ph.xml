      <title>Boundary conditions and violations of bulk-edge correspondence in a hydrodynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence is a wide-ranging principle that applies to topological matter, as well as a precise result established in a large and growing number of cases. According to the principle, the distinctive topological properties of matter, thought of as extending indefinitely in space, are equivalently reflected in the excitations running along its boundary, when one is present. Indices encode those properties, and their values, when differing, are witness to a violation of that correspondence. We address such violations, as they are encountered in a hydrodynamic context. The model concerns a shallow layer of fluid in a rotating frame and provides a local description of waves propagating either across the oceans or along a coastline; it becomes topological when suitably modified at short distances. The edge index is sensitive to boundary conditions, as exemplified in earlier work, hence exhibiting a violation. Here we present classification of all (local, self-adjoint) boundary conditions and a parameterization of their manifold. They come in four families, distinguished in part by the degree of their underlying differential operators. Essentially, that degree counts the degrees of freedom of the hydrodynamic field that are constrained at the boundary by way of their normal derivatives. Generally, both the correspondence and its violation are typical. Within families though, the maximally possible amount of violation is increasing with its degree. Several indices of interest are charted for all boundary conditions. A single spectral mechanism for the onset of violations is furthermore identified. The role of a symmetry is investigated.</description>

      <title>The Bogoliubov-Bose-Hubbard model: existence of minimizers and phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variational approach to the Bose-Hubbard model based on Bogoliubov theory. We introduce the grand canonical and canonical free energy functional for which we prove the existence of minimizers. By analyzing their structure we show the existence of a superfluid-Mott insulator phase transition at positive temperatures. In particular, we show that this model does not exhibit a quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>WKB Methods for Finite Difference Schrodinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14628v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we develop WKB techniques for the finite difference Schrodinger equation, following the construction of the WKB approach for the standard differential Schrodinger equation. In particular, we will develop an all-order WKB algorithm to get arbitrary hbar-corrections and construct a general quantum momentum, underlining the various properties of its coefficients and the quantities that will be used when constructing the quantization condition. In doing so, we discover the existence of additional periodic factors that need to be considered in order to obtain the most general solution to the problem at hand. We will then proceed to study the simplest non trivial example, the linear potential case and the Bessel functions, that provide a solution to the linear problem.
  After studying the resurgence properties of the Bessel functions from an analytical and numerical point of view, we will then proceed to use those results in order to build general connection formulae, allowing us to connect the local solutions defined on two sides of a turning point into a smooth solution on the whole real line. With those connection formulae, we will analyse a selection of problems, constructing the discrete spectrum of various finite difference Schrodinger problems and comparing our results with existing literature.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue systems for integer orthogonal bases of multi-matrix invariants at finite N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-matrix invariants, and in particular the scalar multi-trace operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry, can be described using permutation centraliser algebras (PCA), which are generalisations of the symmetric group algebras and independent of $N$. Free-field two-point functions define an $N$-dependent inner product on the PCA, and bases of operators have been constructed which are orthogonal at finite $N$. Two such bases are well-known, the restricted Schur and covariant bases, and both definitions involve representation-theoretic quantities such as Young diagram labels, multiplicity labels, branching and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for symmetric groups. The explicit computation of these coefficients grows rapidly in complexity as the operator length increases. We develop a new method for explicitly constructing all the operators with specified Young diagram labels, based on an $N$-independent integer eigensystem formulated in the PCA. The eigensystem construction naturally leads to orthogonal basis elements which are integer linear combinations of the multi-trace operators, and the $N$-dependence of their norms are simple known dimension factors. We provide examples and give computer codes in SageMath which efficiently implement the construction for operators of classical dimension up to 14. While the restricted Schur basis relies on the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of symmetric group algebras, the covariant basis relies on a variant which we refer to as the Kronecker decomposition. Analogous decompositions exist for any finite group algebra and the eigenvalue construction of integer orthogonal bases extends to the group algebra of any finite group with rational characters.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing from previous work on the integer quantum Hall effect, we construct the effective action for the analog of Laughlin states for the fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions. The formalism is a generalization of the parton picture used in two spatial dimensions, the crucial ingredient being the cancellation of anomalies for the gauge fields binding the partons together. Some subtleties which exist even in two dimensions are pointed out. The effective action is obtained from a combination of the Dolbeault and Dirac index theorems. We also present expressions for some transport coefficients such as Hall conductivity and Hall viscosity for the fractional states.</description>

      <title>Higher form symmetries, membranes and flux quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher Forms Symmetries (HFS) of a closed bosonic M2-brane theory formulated from the world-volume perspective on a compactified target space $\mathcal{M}_9 \times T^2$ are obtained. We show that the cancellation of the 't Hooft anomaly present in the theory is related to a 3-form flux with 1-gerbe structure associated to the world-volume flux quantization condition. A Wilson surface is naturally defined on the topological operator that characterize the holonomy of the M2-brane. The projection of the flux quantization condition onto the spatial part of the worldvolume, leads to a flux quantization on the M2-brane. The topological operators realise discrete symmetries associated with the winding and the flux/monopole condition. The algebra of operators is well defined.</description>

Abstract: The family of mappings of the plane possessing a biquadratic invaiant, which is known collectively as QRT maps, is composed of two involutions, one preserving a vertical shift and the other preserving a horizontal shift in the plane. In this paper, we extend the map by replacing each shift by the group operation on each of two families of elliptic curves, whose product forms a bielliptic surface.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics: deducing the formalism from experimental observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics from phenomenological observations only. Thus, the only assumed inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are allowed. We show that it is indeed possible to derive in such a way a complete and fully functional formalism based on the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the obtained formal description -- the bi-trajectory formalism -- turns out to be quite different from the standard state-focused formalism.</description>

      <title>The multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality and the squashed entanglement of the extreme multimode bosonic Gaussian channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality for bosonic quantum systems. This inequality determines the minimum conditional von Neumann entropy of the output of the most general linear mixing of bosonic quantum modes among all the input states of the modes with given conditional entropies. Bosonic quantum systems constitute the mathematical model for the electromagnetic radiation in the quantum regime, which provides the most promising platform for quantum communication and quantum key distribution. We apply our multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality to determine new lower bounds to the squashed entanglement of a large family of bosonic quantum Gaussian states. The squashed entanglement is one of the main entanglement measures in quantum communication theory, providing the best known upper bound to the distillable key. Exploiting this result, we determine a new lower bound to the squashed entanglement of the multimode bosonic Gaussian channels that are extreme, i.e., that cannot be decomposed as a non-trivial convex combination of quantum channels. The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel provides an upper bound to its secret-key capacity, i.e., the capacity to generate a secret key shared between the sender and the receiver. Lower bounds to the squashed entanglement are notoriously hard to prove. Our results contribute to break this barrier and will stimulate further research in the field of quantum communication with bosonic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On the moments of the mass of shrinking balls under the Critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) is a measure valued stochastic process on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that defines a non-trivial solution to the two-dimensional stochastic heat equation with multiplicative space-time noise. Its one-time marginals are a.s. singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, meaning that the mass they assign to shrinking balls decays to zero faster than their Lebesgue volume. In this work we explore the intermittency properties of the Critical 2d SHF by studying the asymptotics of the $h$-th moment of the mass that it assigns to shrinking balls of radius $\epsilon$ and we determine that its ratio to the Lebesgue volume is of order $(\log\tfrac{1}{\epsilon})^{{h\choose 2}}$ up to possible lower order corrections.</description>

Abstract: Bivariate Griffiths polynomials of Racah type are constructed from univariate Racah polynomials. The bispectral properties of the former are deduced from simple properties of the latter. A duality relation and the orthogonality of these polynomials are provided. The domain of validity for the indices and variables of these polynomials is also determined. Particular limits on the parameters entering the polynomials allow to define several Griffiths polynomials of other types. One special limit connects them to the original Griffiths polynomials (of Krawtchouk type). Finally, a connection with the $9j$ symbols is made.</description>

Abstract: A direct reformulation of the Hamiltonian formalism in terms of the intrinsic geometry of infinitely prolonged differential equations is obtained. Concepts of spatial equation and spatial-gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian system of equations are introduced. A non-covariant canonical variational principle is proposed and demonstrated using the Maxwell equations as an example. A covariant canonical variational principle is formulated. The results obtained are applicable to any variational equations, including those that do not originate in physics.</description>

      <title>On the stability of solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger's equation short of the adiabatic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an adiabatic theorem that applies at timescales short of the typical adiabatic limit. Our proof analyzes the stability of solutions to Schrodinger's equation under perturbation. We directly characterize cross-subspace effects of perturbation, which are typically significantly less than suggested by the perturbation's operator norm. This stability has numerous consequences: we can (1) find timescales where the solution of Schrodinger's equation converges to the ground state of a subspace, (2) lower bound the convergence to the global ground state by demonstrating convergence to some other known quantum state, (3) guarantee faster convergence than the standard adiabatic theorem when the ground state of the perturbed Hamiltonian is close to that of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, and (4) bound leakage effects in terms of the global spectral gap when the Hamiltonian is ``stoquastic'' (a $Z$-matrix). Our results can help explain quantum annealing protocols that exhibit faster convergence than is guaranteed by a standard adiabatic theorem. Our upper and lower bounds demonstrate that at timescales short of the adiabatic limit, subspace dynamics can dominate over global dynamics. Thus, we see that, when our results apply, convergence to particular global target states can be understood as the result of local dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large deformations in terms of stretch and rotation and global solution to the quasi-stationary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new model for visco-elasticity with large deformations where the independent variables are the stretch and the rotation tensors which intervene with second gradients terms accounting for physical properties in the principle of virtual power. Another basic feature of our model is that there is conditional compatibility, entering the model as kinematic constraints and depending on the magnitude of an internal force associated to dislocations. Moreover, due to the kinematic constraints, the virtual velocities depend on the solutions of the problem. As a consequence, the variational formulation of the problem and the related mathematical analysis are neither standard nor straightforward. We adopt the strategy to invert the kinematic constraints through Green propagators, obtaining a system of integro-differential coupled equations. As a first mathematical step, we develop the analysis of the model in a simplified setting, i.e. considering the quasi-stationary version of the full system where we neglect inertia. In this context, we prove the existence of a global in time strong solution in three space dimensions for the system, employing techniques from PDEs and convex analysis, thus obtaining a novel breakthrough in the field of three-dimensional finite visco-elasticity described in terms of the stretch and rotation variables. We also study a limit problem, letting the magnitude of the internal force associated to dislocations tend to zero, in which case the deformation becomes incompatible and the equations takes the form of a coupled system of PDEs. For the limit problem we obtain global existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence from data in three space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Yangian for cotangent Lie algebras and spectral $R$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a canonical quantization of Lie bialgebra structures on the formal power series $\mathfrak{d}[\![t]\!]$ with coefficients in the cotangent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d} = T^*\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g} \ltimes \mathfrak{g}^*$ to a simple complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that these quantizations produce twists to the natural analog of the Yangian for $\mathfrak{d}$. Moreover, we construct spectral $R$-matrices for these twisted Yangians as compositions of twisting matrices.
  The motivation for the construction of these twisted Yangians over $\mathfrak{d}$ comes from certain 4d holomorphic-topological gauge theory. More precisely, we show that pertubative line operators in this theory can be realized as representations of these Yangians. Moreover, the comultiplications of these Yangians correspond to the monodial structure of the category of line operators.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry of the Robinson-Trautman solution</title>

Abstract: The Robinson-Trautman solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ system admits a shear-free and twist-free null geodesic congruence with a nonvanishing expansion. Restricting to the case where the Maxwell field is aligned, i.e., the spacetime is algebraically special, we provide an exhaustive classification of supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman spacetimes in the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity. The differential constraints that arise from the integrability conditions of the Killing spinor equation enable us to systematically reconstruct the metric. We derive the explicit form of the Killing spinor either by directly integrating the Killing spinor equation or by casting the solution into the canonical form of supersymmetric solutions given in hep-th/0307022. In any case, the supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman solution generically exhibits a naked singularity.</description>
