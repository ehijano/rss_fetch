      <title>Data inaccuracy quantification and uncertainty propagation for bibliometric indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces an approach to estimate the uncertainty in bibliometric indicator values that is caused by data errors. This approach utilizes Bayesian regression models, estimated from empirical data samples, which are used to predict error-free data. Through direct Monte Carlo simulation - drawing many replicates of predicted data from the estimated regression models for the same input data - probability distributions for indicator values can be obtained, which provide the information on their uncertainty due to data errors. It is demonstrated how uncertainty in base quantities, such as the number of publications of a unit of certain document types and the number of citations of a publication, can be propagated along a measurement model into final indicator values. Synthetic examples are used to illustrate the method and real bibliometric research evaluation data is used to show its application in practice. Though in this contribution we just use two out of a larger number of known bibliometric error categories and therefore can account for only some part of the total uncertainty due to inaccuracies, the latter example reveals that average values of citation impact scores of publications of research groups need to be used very cautiously as they often have large margins of error resulting from data inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Data Science from 1963 to 2012</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03292v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consensus on the definition of data science remains low despite the widespread establishment of academic programs in the field and continued demand for data scientists in industry. Definitions range from rebranded statistics to data-driven science to the science of data to simply the application of machine learning to so-called big data to solve real-world problems. Current efforts to trace the history of the field in order to clarify its definition, such as Donoho's "50 Years of Data Science" (Donoho 2017), tend to focus on a short period when a small group of statisticians adopted the term in an unsuccessful attempt to rebrand their field in the face of the overshadowing effects of computational statistics and data mining. Using textual evidence from primary sources, this essay traces the history of the term to the 1960s, when it was first used by the US Air Force in a surprisingly similar way to its current usage, to 2012, the year that Harvard Business Review published the enormously influential article "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century" (Davenport and Patil 2012) and the American Statistical Association acknowledged a profound disconnect between statistics and data science (Rodriguez 2012). Among the themes that emerge from this review are (1) the long-standing opposition between data analysts and data miners that continues to animate the field, (2) an established definition of the term as the practice of managing and processing scientific data that has been occluded by recent usage, and (3) the phenomenon of data impedance -- the disproportion between surplus data, indexed by phrases like data deluge and big data, and the limitations of computational machinery and methods to process them. This persistent condition appears to have motivated the use of the term and the field itself since its beginnings.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Large Language Models in Academia: from Writing to Speaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly impacting human society, particularly in textual information. Based on more than 30,000 papers and 1,000 presentations from machine learning conferences, we examined and compared the words used in writing and speaking, representing the first large-scale study of how LLMs influence the two main modes of verbal communication and expression within the same group of people. Our empirical results show that LLM-style words such as "significant" have been used more frequently in abstracts and oral presentations. The impact on speaking is beginning to emerge and is likely to grow in the future, calling attention to the implicit influence and ripple effect of LLMs on human society.</description>

      <title>Automatic Search of Multiword Place Names on Historical Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historical maps are invaluable sources of information about the past, and scanned historical maps are increasingly accessible in online libraries. To retrieve maps from these large libraries that contain specific places of interest, previous work has applied computer vision techniques to recognize words on historical maps, enabling searches for maps that contain specific place names. However, searching for multiword place names is challenging due to complex layouts of text labels on historical maps. This paper proposes an efficient query method for searching a given multiword place name on historical maps. Using existing methods to recognize words on historical maps, we link single-word text labels into potential multiword phrases by constructing minimum spanning trees. These trees aim to link pairs of text labels that are spatially close and have similar height, angle, and capitalization. We then query these trees for the given multiword place name. We evaluate the proposed method in two experiments: 1) to evaluate the accuracy of the minimum spanning tree approach at linking multiword place names and 2) to evaluate the number and time range of maps retrieved by the query approach. The resulting maps reveal how places using multiword names have changed on a large number of maps from across history.</description>
