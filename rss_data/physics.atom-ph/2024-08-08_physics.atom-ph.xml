      <title>Feasibility of a directional solar neutrino measurement with the CYGNO/INITIUM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past five decades, solar neutrino research has been pivotal in driving significant scientific advancements, enriching our comprehension of both neutrino characteristics and solar processes. Despite numerous experiments dedicated to solar neutrino detection, a segment of the lower pp spectrum remains unexplored, while the precision of measurements from the CNO cycle remains insufficient to resolve the solar abundance problem determined by the discrepancy between the data gathered from helioseismology and the forecasts generated by stellar interior models for the Sun. The CYGNO/INITIUM experiment aims to deploy a large 30 m3 directional detector for rare event searches focusing on Dark Matter. Recently, in the CYGNUS collaboration, there has been consideration for employing these time projection chamber technology in solar neutrino directional detection trough neutrino-electron elastic scattering. This is due to their potential to conduct low-threshold, high-precision measurements with spectroscopic neutrino energy reconstruction on an event-by-event basis driven by the kinematic. However, so far, no experiments have been investigated on the feasibility of this measurement using actual detector performances and background levels. Such a detector already with a volume of O(10) m3 could perform an observation of solar neutrino from the pp chain with an unprecedented low threshold, while with larger volumes it could measure the CNO cycle eventually solving the solar metallicity problem.</description>

      <title>Capturing Nonlinear Electron Dynamics with Fully Characterised Attosecond X-ray Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are the key to studying electron dynamics at their natural time scale involving specific electronic states. They are promising to build the conceptual bridge between physical and chemical photo-reaction processes. Free-electron lasers have demonstrated their capability of generating intense attosecond X-ray pulses. However, harnessing them for time-resolving experiments and investigations of nonlinear X-ray absorption mechanisms remains a cutting-edge challenge. We have characterised X-ray pulses with durations of down to 700$\,$attoseconds and peak powers up to 200$\,$GW at $\sim$ 1$\,$keV photon energy via angular streaking at the SQS instrument of the European XFEL. As direct application, we present results of nonlinear X-ray-matter interaction via state-specific spectroscopy on a transient system. Using the derived spectral and temporal information of each pulse, we deliberately steer the probability for formation of double-core vacancies in neon gas atoms through excitation or ionisation of the second inner-shell electron after K-shell ionisation. Our results advance the field of attosecond science with highly intense and fully characterised X-ray pulses to the site-specific investigation of electronic motion in transient media.</description>

      <title>Additively manufactured ceramics for compact quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are advancing from fundamental research in specialized laboratories to practical applications in the field, driving the demand for robust, scalable, and reproducible system integration techniques. Ceramic components can be pivotal thanks to high stiffness, low thermal expansion, and excellent dimensional stability under thermal stress. We explore lithography-based additive manufacturing of technical ceramics especially for miniaturized physics packages and electro-optical systems. This approach enables functional systems with precisely manufactured, intricate structures and high mechanical stability while minimizing size and weight. It facilitates rapid prototyping, simplifies fabrication and leads to highly integrated, reliable devices. As an electrical insulator with low outgassing and high temperature stability, printed technical ceramics such as Al2O3 and AlN bridge a technology gap in quantum technology and offer advantages over other printable materials. We demonstrate this potential with CerAMRef, a micro-integrated rubidium D2 line optical frequency reference on a printed Al2O3 micro-optical bench and housing. The frequency instability of the reference is comparable to laboratory setups while the volume of the integrated spectroscopy setup is only 6 ml. We identify potential for future applications in compact atomic magnetometers, miniaturized optical atom traps, and vacuum system integration.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in molecules II: higher order corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline a general formalism for treating vacuum polarization phenomena within an effective field expansion. The coupling between source charges and virtual fields is examined from the perspectives of electrostatic potentials, induced charge densities and form factors in momentum space. A strategy for the efficient calculation of vacuum polarization potentials is outlined, implemented, and applied towards the construction of fitting potentials that are suitable for molecular electronic structure calculations, which enclose no overall charge by construction. The order $\alpha(Z \alpha)$, $\alpha (Z \alpha)^{3}$ and $\alpha^{2}(Z\alpha)$ effects of a Gaussian nuclear charge on the electron-positron field are applied variationally towards the E119F molecule, as well as the order $\alpha(Z \alpha)$ effects arising from the virtual muon and charged pion fields.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in molecules I: Uehling interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative corrections to electronic structure are characterized by perturbative expansions in $\alpha$ and $Z\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant and $Z$ is the nuclear charge. A formulation of the leading-order $\alpha(Z\alpha)$ Uehling contribution to the renormalized vacuum polarization is reported in a form that is convenient for implementation in computational studies of the relativistic electronic structures of molecules. Benchmark calculations based on these methods are reported that include the leading-order vacuum polarization effects within relativistic mean-field methods for the E119$^+$ ion and the closed-shell diatomic species E119F.</description>
