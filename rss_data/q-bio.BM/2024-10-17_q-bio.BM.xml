      <title>SynFlowNet: Design of Diverse and Novel Molecules with Synthesis Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models see increasing use in computer-aided drug design. However, while performing well at capturing distributions of molecular motifs, they often produce synthetically inaccessible molecules. To address this, we introduce SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet model whose action space uses chemical reactions and buyable reactants to sequentially build new molecules. By incorporating forward synthesis as an explicit constraint of the generative mechanism, we aim at bridging the gap between in silico molecular generation and real world synthesis capabilities. We evaluate our approach using synthetic accessibility scores and an independent retrosynthesis tool to assess the synthesizability of our compounds, and motivate the choice of GFlowNets through considerable improvement in sample diversity compared to baselines. Additionally, we identify challenges with reaction encodings that can complicate traversal of the MDP in the backward direction. To address this, we introduce various strategies for learning the GFlowNet backward policy and thus demonstrate how additional constraints can be integrated into the GFlowNet MDP framework. This approach enables our model to successfully identify synthesis pathways for previously unseen molecules.</description>

      <title>Guided Multi-objective Generative AI to Enhance Structure-based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. Yet, despite recent advances in deep learning, existing models cannot generate molecules that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a generative chemistry AI combining diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. Differentiable scoring functions guide the latent variables of the diffusion model to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate our platform's effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10%-20% better than the next best state-of-the-art method on each test set, producing more drug-like molecules with generally better synthetic accessibility scores than other methods. We do a head-to-head comparison of IDOLpro against a classic virtual screen of a large database of drug-like molecules. We show that IDOLpro can generate molecules for a range of important disease-related targets with better binding affinity and synthetic accessibility than any molecule found in the virtual screen while being over 100x faster and less expensive to run. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to produce molecules with better binding affinities than experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.</description>
