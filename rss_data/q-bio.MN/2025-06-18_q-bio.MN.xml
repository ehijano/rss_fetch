      <title>Attractor Stability of Boolean networks under noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of noise on attractor dynamics in Boolean networks, focusing on their stability and transition behaviors. By constructing attractor matrices based on single-node perturbations, we propose a framework to quantify attractor stability and identify dominant attractors. We find that attractors are more stable than predicted by basin sizes, showing the importance of dynamical structure in noisy environments. In addition, under global perturbations, basin sizes dictate long-term behavior; under local noise, however, attractor dominance is determined by noise-induced transition patterns rather than basin sizes. Our results show that transition dynamics induced by stochastic perturbations provide an efficient and quantitative description for the attractor stability and dynamics in Boolean networks under noise.</description>

      <title>Duplication-divergence growing graph models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired algorithm for simulating viral response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of biological systems is an exciting avenue for applying advanced approaches to solving corresponding computational tasks. A specific class of problems that arises in the resolution of biological challenges is optimization. In this work, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study that applies a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to simulate a viral response. We formulate an Ising-type model to describe the patterns of gene activity in host responses. Reducing the problem to the Ising form allows the use of available quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools. We demonstrate the application of a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to this problem. Our study paves the way for exploring the full potential of quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools in biological applications.</description>
