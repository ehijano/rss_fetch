      <title>Mass-gap description of heavy impurities in Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.</description>

      <title>Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and sub-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</description>

      <title>The Solid-state Physics of Rydberg-dressed Bosonic Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore phases of two-component Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates in three spatial dimensions. The competition between the effective ranges of inter- and intra-component soft-core interactions leads to a rich variety of ground states. These include states resembling ionic compounds with face-centered cubic or simple cubic lattice structure. Upon increasing the scattering length, the dimensionality of the symmetry-breaking is lower due to the suppression of large densities, leading to segregated planar or tubular density profiles. We also show that these states are not only stable ground states, but can also emerge dynamically upon time evolution.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing dual lattice by strong-pulse matter-wave diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual lattices such as honeycomb and hexagonal lattices typically obey Babinet's principle in optics, which states that the expected interference patterns of two complementary diffracting objects are identical and indistinguishable, except for their overall intensity. Here, we study Kapitza--Dirac diffraction of Bose--Einstein condensates in optical lattices and find that matter waves in dual lattices obey Babinet's principle only under the condition of weak-pulse Raman--Nath regimes. In contrast, the Kapitza--Dirac matter-wave diffraction in the strong-pulse Raman--Nath regime (corresponding to the phase wrapping method we developed to generate sub-wavelength phase structures in Sci. Rep. 10, 5870 (2020)) can break Babinet's principle and clearly resolve the distinct interference patterns of the dual honeycomb and hexagonal lattices. This method offers exceptional precision in characterizing lattice configurations and advance the study of symmetry-related phenomena, overcoming the limitations of real-space imaging.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Physics from Spin-Phonon Coupling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$ symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit, as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.</description>

      <title>Ultracold high-spin $\Sigma$-state polar molecules for new physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose high-spin $\Sigma$-state polar molecules assembled from ultracold atoms to probe charge-parity violating physics beyond the Standard Model. We identify YbCr as a prime candidate to search for the electric dipole moment of the electron. We show that the combination of relativistic ytterbium and high-spin chromium, amenable to magneto-association, leads to molecules with easy-to-polarize parity doublets and large intramolecular electric fields. Based on \textit{ab initio} results for molecular constants, we predict a sensitivity of $\delta d_{\textrm{e}}= ( 6 \times 10^{-31} / \sqrt{n_{\mathrm{day}}})\,e\,\mathrm{cm}$ via standard spin-precession measurements, we assess the experimental feasibility, and discuss potential extensions to more advanced quantum control as well as searches of the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment. This work paves the way to next-generation searches for new physics with ultracold molecules in both the leptonic and hadronic sectors.</description>

      <title>Trimer superfluidity of antiparallel dipolar excitons in a bilayer heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a bilayer of antiparallel dipolar excitons with a 1:2 density ratio between the layers, as a function of temperature and density. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that such a system supports the formation of trimers, namely, three-exciton bound states consisting of a single dipole in one layer and two dipoles in the second layer. At sufficiently low temperatures and densities, these trimers condense into a trimer superfluid phase. Increasing the excitonic density induces a quantum phase transition into a phase in which condensates of independent dipoles exist in both layers, in parallel to the trimers. We also study the thermal transitions out of these phases, and find that while the normal state is reached directly from the trimer superfluid, the thermal disordering of the two-superfluid phase involves an intermediate state which is either a trimer superfluid or a single excitonic condensate in the denser layer. A potential experimental realization using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures is discussed.</description>

      <title>Relaxation control of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in experiments with open quantum systems is to ensure steady-state convergence within a given operational time window. Here, we devise a general state preparation recipe to control relaxation timescales and achieve steady-state convergence within experimental run times. We do so by constructing a unitary operation that cancels the desired relaxation modes. We provide an example in a few-body interacting system (long-range qubit chain), taking into account limitations of experimentally accessible unitary operations in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic localized modes for DNLS equation with competing nonlinearities: bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonlinear excitations described by DNLS-type equations with so-called competing nonlinearities. These are the nonlinearities that consist of two power terms with coefficients of different sign. A key feature of these models is the presence of two governing parameters: $\alpha$, which characterizes the coupling between lattice sites, and $\gamma$, which quantifies the balance between competing nonlinearities. Our study focuses on intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) -- solutions that exhibit spatial localization over a few lattice sites. The basic example for our study is the cubic-quartic equation that recently has been used to describe 3D BEC cloud in the mean field approximation with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. We employ numerical continuation from the anti-continuum limit (ACL) where the coupling between the lattice sites is neglected (the case $\alpha=0$). We analyze $\alpha$-dependent branches of the basic ILMs and their bifurcations when $\gamma$ varies. Our study shows that all branches of ILMs originated at anti-continuum limit, except a finite number, bifurcate and do not exist for large values of $\alpha$. We present tables of bifurcations for the ILMs that involve not more than 3 excited lattice sites. It is shown that the model supports nonsymmetric ILMs that have no counterparts in ACL. Also we study the branches of ILMs that can be continued unlimitedly when $\alpha\to \infty$ (called here $\infty$-branches). It was found that for any $\gamma$ there are exactly two (up to symmetries) $\infty$-branches. When $\gamma$ grows these branches undergo a sequence of bifurcations. Finally, we compare our results with the results for the quadratic-cubic equation and the cubic-quintic equation and found no qualitative difference in (a) tables of bifurcations, (b) presence of solutions without ACL counterpart and (c) scenario of switching of $\infty$-branches.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in continuous waves, dark solitons, and vortices in linearly coupled bimodal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model governing the copropagation of two components which represent circular polarizations of light in the optical fiber with relative strength g = 2 of the nonlinear repulsion between the components, and linear coupling between them. A more general system of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations, with g =/= 2 and the linear mixing between the components, is considered too. The latter system is introduced in its one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) forms. A new finding is the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of bimodal CW (continuous-wave) states in the case of g &gt; 1 (in the absence of the linear coupling, it corresponds to the immiscibility of the nonlinearly interacting components). The SSB is represented by an exact asymmetric CW solution. An exact solution is also found, in the case of g = 3, for stable dark solitons (DSs) supported by the asymmetric CW background. For g =/= 3, numerical solutions are produced for stable DSs supported by the same background. Moreover, we identify a parameter domain where the fully miscible (symmetric) CW background maintains stable DSs with the inner SSB (separation between the components) in its core. In 2D, the GP system produces stable vortex states with a shift between the components and broken isotropy. The vortices include ones with the inter-component shift imposed by the asymmetric CW background, and states supported by the symmetric background, in which the intrinsic shift (splitting) is exhibited by vortical cores of the two components.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Hartree dynamics for a N-particles fermionic 2D system interacting via long-range electric and magnetic two-body singular potentials in a dilute regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a 2-dimensional system of N fermions interacting through a pairwise electric and magnetic singular interactions with Slater initial data preserves its Slater structure over time when N gets large. In other words, the wave function of the system can be approximated by a Slater determinant whose orbitals evolves according to a coupled system of N Chern-Simons- Schr\"odinger type effective equations. The result holds in a dilute regime where the density is of order one on a large volume proportional to the number of particles. The pairwise magnetic feature of the system implies to deal with the diagonalization of three-body potentials which is the main mathematical innovation of the paper.</description>

      <title>A sublattice Stokes polarimeter for bipartite photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of pseudo-spin provides a general framework for describing physical systems featuring two-component spinors, including light polarization, sublattice degrees of freedom in bipartite lattices, and valley polarization in 2D materials. In all cases, the pseudo-spin can be mapped to a Stokes vector on the Poincar\'e sphere. Stokes polarimeters for measuring the polarization of light are a powerful tool with a wide range of applications both in classical and quantum science. Generalizing Stokes polarimetry to other spinor degrees of freedom is thus a challenge of prime importance. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a Stokes polarimeter for the sublattice polarization in a bipartite photonic lattice. Our method relies on k-space photoluminescence intensity measurements under controlled phase shifts and attenuations applied independently to each sublattice. We implement our method using honeycomb arrays of coupled microcavities realizing photonic analogs of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. Using our sublattice polarimeter, we reconstruct the Bloch modes in amplitude and phase across the Brillouin zone, achieving sub-linewidth precision in the determination of their eigenenergies, including near band touching points. This enables full access to the system Bloch Hamiltonian and quantum geometric tensor. Our approach can readily be extended to more complex systems with additional internal degrees of freedom, enabling experimental investigations of trigonal warping, Chern insulating phases, and Euler-class topology in multigap systems.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we report on the time- and space-resolved measurement of subradiant excited state population in an ultra-cold atomic cloud of 174Yb atoms. We use a depletion imaging technique that exploits the V-type internal energy structure of alkaline-earth-like atoms to directly observe the time-resolved spatial distribution of excited state population. We characterize the decay dynamics of the subradiant modes using both the excited state population and scattered light intensity, finding good quantitative agreement with numerical predictions from simulations of two-level atomic ensembles.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton spectroscopy serves as a sensitive probe of electronic states in two-dimensional semiconductors. A prominent feature in optical spectra is the trion peak arising from the binding of a charge carrier to an exciton. The splitting between the exciton and trion peaks is usually interpreted as the trion binding energy, but we theoretically show that this view is incomplete. Since dark excitons are more strongly bound than the bright exciton, the trion wave function is asymmetric and a large contribution to the measured splitting is the difference between the bright and dark exciton binding energies. Our model quantitatively explains the measured trion energies in MoSe2 and WSe2, demonstrating the importance of the internal structure of the exciton for the interpretation of the optical response of transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

Abstract: The Haldane phase with local SU(3) adjoint representation constitutes the simplest non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phases in the SU($N&gt;2$) Heisenberg spin chains. In this paper, we propose a quantum simulation of this phase using a two-species spinor Bose gas. The system consists of two interlaced, species-dependent zigzag optical lattices, where the two species label the quark and antiquark states of SU(3) symmetry. In the strong-coupling limit, we determine the ground-state phase diagram, and identify a quantum phase transition from the Haldane phase to a dimer phase. We characterize the Haldane phase through its experimental signatures, including edge modes, nonlocal string order, and entanglement spectra. To further understand these observations at the dimer phase, we construct an explicit ground-state ansatz at the dimer point.</description>

      <title>Mitigating higher-band heating in Floquet-Hubbard lattices via two-tone driving</title>

Abstract: Multi-photon resonances to high-lying energy levels represent an unavoidable source of Floquet heating in strongly driven quantum systems. In this work, we extend the recently developed two-tone approach of 'cancelling' multi-photon resonances to shaken lattices in the Hubbard regime. Our experiments show that even for strong lattice shaking the inclusion of a weak second drive leads to cancellation of multi-photon heating resonances. Surprisingly, the optimal cancelling amplitude depends on the Hubbard interaction strength $U$, in qualitative agreement with exact diagonalisation calculations. Our results call for novel analytical approaches to capture the physics of strongly-driven-strongly-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Genuine quantum scars in many-body spin systems</title>

Abstract: Chaos makes isolated systems of many interacting particles quickly thermalize and forget about their past. Here, we show that quantum mechanics hinders chaos in many-body systems: although the quantum eigenstates are thermal and strongly entangled, exponentially many of them are scarred, that is, have an enlarged weight along underlying classical unstable periodic orbits. Scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past and thus weakly breaking ergodicity, even at long times and despite the system being fully thermal and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis fulfilled. We demonstrate the ubiquity of quantum scarring in many-body systems by considering a large family of spin models, including some of the most popular ones from condensed matter physics. Our findings, at hand for modern quantum simulators, prove structure in spite of chaos in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Constructing Quantum Many-Body Scars from Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS with nontrivial spatial connectivity. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.</description>
