      <title>Evolutionary Algorithms for Computing Nash Equilibria in Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic nonzero sum games are widely used to model multi agent decision making in control, economics, and related fields. Classical methods for computing Nash equilibria, especially in linear quadratic settings, rely on strong structural assumptions and become impractical for nonlinear dynamics, many players, or long horizons, where multiple local equilibria may exist. We show through examples that such methods can fail to reach the true global Nash equilibrium even in relatively small games. To address this, we propose two population based evolutionary algorithms for general dynamic games with linear or nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary objective functions: a co evolutionary genetic algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization scheme. Both approaches search directly over joint strategy spaces without restrictive assumptions and are less prone to getting trapped in local Nash equilibria, providing more reliable approximations to global Nash solutions.</description>

      <title>Evolving Personalities in Chaos: An LLM-Augmented Framework for Character Discovery in the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma under Environmental Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard simulations of the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma (IPD) operate in deterministic, noise-free environments, producing strategies that may be theoretically optimal but fragile when confronted with real-world uncertainty. This paper addresses two critical gaps in evolutionary game theory research: (1) the absence of realistic environmental stressors during strategy evolution, and (2) the Interpretability Gap, where evolved genetic strategies remain opaque binary sequences devoid of semantic meaning. We introduce a novel framework combining stochastic environmental perturbations (God Mode) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based behavioral profiling to transform evolved genotypes into interpretable character archetypes. Our experiments demonstrate that strategies evolved under chaotic conditions exhibit superior resilience and present distinct behavioral phenotypes, ranging from Ruthless Capitalists to Diplomatic Enforcers. These phenotypes are readily classified by LLMs but remain nearly impossible to interpret through manual genome inspection alone. This work bridges evolutionary computation with explainable AI and provides a template for automated agent characterization in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Auditing for Core Stability in Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the participatory budgeting problem where each of $n$ voters specifies additive utilities over $m$ candidate projects with given sizes, and the goal is to choose a subset of projects (i.e., a committee) with total size at most $k$. Participatory budgeting mathematically generalizes multiwinner elections, and both have received great attention in computational social choice recently. A well-studied notion of group fairness in this setting is core stability: Each voter is assigned an "entitlement" of $\frac{k}{n}$, so that a subset $S$ of voters can pay for a committee of size at most $|S| \cdot \frac{k}{n}$. A given committee is in the core if no subset of voters can pay for another committee that provides each of them strictly larger utility. This provides proportional representation to all voters in a strong sense.
  In this paper, we study the following auditing question: Given a committee computed by some preference aggregation method, how close is it to the core? Concretely, how much does the entitlement of each voter need to be scaled down by, so that the core property subsequently holds? As our main contribution, we present computational hardness results for this problem, as well as a logarithmic approximation algorithm via linear program rounding. We show that our analysis is tight against the linear programming bound. Additionally, we consider two related notions of group fairness that have similar audit properties. The first is Lindahl priceability, which audits the closeness of a committee to a market clearing solution. We show that this is related to the linear programming relaxation of auditing the core, leading to efficient exact and approximation algorithms for auditing. The second is a novel weakening of the core that we term the sub-core, and we present computational results for auditing this notion as well.</description>

      <title>It's Not All Black and White: Degree of Truthfulness for Risk-Avoiding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic notion of \emph{truthfulness} requires that no agent has a profitable manipulation -- an untruthful report that, for \emph{some} combination of reports of the other agents, increases her utility. This strong notion implicitly assumes that the manipulating agent either knows what all other agents are going to report, or is willing to take the risk and act as-if she knows their reports.
  Without knowledge of the others' reports, most manipulations are \emph{risky} -- they might decrease the manipulator's utility for some other combinations of reports by the other agents. Accordingly, a recent paper (Bu, Song and Tao, ``On the existence of truthful fair cake cutting mechanisms'', Artificial Intelligence 319 (2023), 103904) suggests a relaxed notion, which we refer to as \emph{risk-avoiding truthfulness (RAT)}, which requires only that no agent can gain from a \emph{safe} manipulation -- one that is sometimes beneficial and never harmful.
  Truthfulness and RAT are two extremes: the former considers manipulators with complete knowledge of others, whereas the latter considers manipulators with no knowledge at all. In reality, agents often know about some -- but not all -- of the other agents. This paper introduces the \emph{RAT-degree} of a mechanism, defined as the smallest number of agents whose reports, if known, may allow another agent to safely manipulate, or $n$ if there is no such number. This notion interpolates between classic truthfulness (degree $n$) and RAT (degree at least $1$): a mechanism with a higher RAT-degree is harder to manipulate safely.
  To illustrate the generality and applicability of this concept, we analyze the RAT-degree of prominent mechanisms across various social choice settings, including auctions, indivisible goods allocations, cake-cutting, voting, and two-sided matching.</description>

      <title>Optimal Boost Design for Auto-bidding Mechanism with Publisher Quality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online bidding serves as a fundamental information system in mobile ecosystems, facilitating real-time ad allocation across billions of devices while optimizing both platform performance and user experience through data-driven decision making. Improving ad allocation efficiency is a long-standing research problem, as it directly enhances the economic outcomes for all participants in advertising platforms. This paper investigates the design of optimal boost factors in online bidding while incorporating quality value (the impact of displayed ads on publishers' long-term benefits). To address the divergent interests on quality, we establish a three-party auction framework with a unified welfare metric of advertiser and publisher. Within this framework, we derive the theoretical efficiency lower bound for C-competitive boost in second-price single-slot auctions, then design a novel quality-involved Boosting (q-Boost) algorithm for computing the optimal boost factor. Experimental validation on Alibaba's public dataset (AuctionNet) demonstrates 2%-6% welfare improvements over conventional approaches, proving our method's effectiveness in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal Allocations under Strongly Pigou-Dalton Criteria: Hidden Layer Structure &amp; Efficient Combinatorial Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate optimal social welfare allocations of $m$ items to $n$ agents with binary additive or submodular valuations. For binary additive valuations, we prove that the set of optimal allocations coincides with the set of so-called \emph{stable allocations}, as long as the employed criterion for evaluating social welfare is strongly Pigou-Dalton (SPD) and symmetric. Many common criteria are SPD and symmetric, such as Nash social welfare, leximax, leximin, Gini index, entropy, and envy sum. We also design efficient algorithms for finding a stable allocation, including an $O(m^2n)$ time algorithm for the case of indivisible items, and an $O(m^2n^5)$ time one for the case of divisible items. The first is faster than the existing algorithms or has a simpler analysis. The latter is the first combinatorial algorithm for that problem. It utilizes a hidden layer partition of items and agents admitted by all stable allocations, and cleverly reduces the case of divisible items to the case of indivisible items.In addition, we show that the profiles of different optimal allocations have a small Chebyshev distance, which is 0 for the case of divisible items under binary additive valuations, and is at most 1 for the case of indivisible items under binary submodular valuations.</description>
