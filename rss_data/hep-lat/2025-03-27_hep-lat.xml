      <title>The Scalar Size of the Pion from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the pion scalar form factor and associated radii with fully controlled systematics. Lattice results are computed on a large set of 17 gauge ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ Wilson Clover-improved sea quarks. These ensembles cover four values of the lattice spacing between $a=0.049\mathrm{fm}$ and $a=0.086\mathrm{fm}$, a pion mass range of $130 - 350\mathrm{MeV}$ and various physical volumes. A precise determination of the notorious quark-disconnected contributions facilitates an unprecedented momentum resolution for the form factor, particularly on large and fine ensembles in the vicinity of physical quark mass. A large range of source-sink separations $1.0\mathrm{fm} \lesssim t_\mathrm{sep} \lesssim 3.25\mathrm{fm}$ is used to reliably extract the relevant ground state matrix elements at vanishing and non-vanishing momentum transfer. This allows us for the first time to obtain the scalar radii from a $z$-expansion parametrization of the $Q^2$-dependence of the resulting form factors rather than a simple, linear approximation at small momentum transfer. The physical extrapolation for the radii is carried out using three-flavor NLO chiral perturbation theory to parametrize the quark mass dependence in terms of three low-energy constants, including the first lattice determination of $L_4^r$. Systematic uncertainties on the final results related to the ground state extraction, form factor parametrization as well as the physical extrapolation are accounted for via model averages based on the Akaike Information Criterion.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Constants of Chiral Perturbation Theory from Pion Scalar Form Factors in $N_f=2+1$-Flavor Lattice QCD with Controlled Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the low-energy constants (LECs) $f_0$, $L_4^r$ and $L_5^r$ of SU(3) Chiral Perturbation Theory ($\chi$PT) from a lattice QCD calculation of the scalar form factors of the pion with fully controlled systematics. Lattice results are computed on a large set of $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensembles covering four lattice spacings $a\in[0.049,0.086]\mathrm{fm}$, pion masses $M_\pi\in[130,350]\mathrm{MeV}$, and various large physical volumes. By determining the notorious quark-disconnected contributions with unprecedented precision and using a large range of source-sink separations $t_\mathrm{sep}\in[1.0,3.25]\mathrm{fm}$, we are able for the first time to obtain the scalar radii from a $z$-expansion parameterization of the form factors rather than a simple linear approximation at small momentum transfer. The LECs are obtained from the physical extrapolation of the radii using NLO SU(3) NLO $\chi$PT to parameterize the quark mass dependence. Systematic uncertainties are estimated via model averages based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Our determination of $L_4^r$ is the first lattice determination to obtain a result not compatible with zero.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.</description>

      <title>Model Independent Tests of the Hadronic Vacuum Polarization Contribution to the Muon $g$$-$$2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contributions to the muon $g$$-$$2$ are the crucial quantity to resolve whether new physics is present or not in the comparison between the Standard Model (SM) prediction and experimental measurements at Fermilab. They are commonly and historically determined via dispersion relations using a vast catalogue of experimentally measured, low-energy $e^+e^-\to \,\rm{hadrons}$ cross section data as input. These dispersive estimates result in a SM prediction that exhibits a muon $g$$-$$2$ discrepancy of more than $5\sigma$ when compared to experiment. However, recent lattice QCD evaluations of the HVP and a new hadronic cross section measurement from the CMD-3 experiment favor a no-new-physics scenario and, therefore, exhibit a common tension with the previous $e^+e^-\to \,\rm{hadrons}$ data. This study explores the current and future implications of these two scenarios on other observables that are also sensitive to the HVP contributions in the hope that they may provide independent tests of the current tensions observed in the muon $g$$-$$2$.</description>
