      <title>Coherent Modulation of Two-Dimensional Moir\'e States with On-Chip THz Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) structures of two-dimensional materials host a broad range of physical phenomena. New opportunities arise if different functional layers may be remotely modulated or coupled in a device structure. Here we demonstrate the in-situ coherent modulation of moir\'e excitons and correlated Mott insulators in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homo- or hetero-bilayers with on-chip terahertz (THz) waves. Using common dual-gated device structures, each consisting of a TMD moir\'e bilayer sandwiched between two few-layer graphene (fl-Gr) gates with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) spacers, we launch coherent phonon wavepackets at ~0.4-1 THz from the fl-Gr gates by femtosecond laser excitation. The waves travel through the h-BN spacer, arrive at the TMD bilayer with precise timing, and coherently modulate the moir\'e excitons or the Mott states. These results demonstrate that the fl-Gr gates, often used for electrical control of the material properties, can serve as effective on-chip opto-elastic transducers to generate THz waves for the coherent control and vibrational entanglement of functional layers in commonly used moir\'e devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse spin Hall effect used for detection of spin currents was observed by voltage measurements in bilayers of normal metal (NM)/ferromagnetic metal (FM), using Nb, Mo and Bi as normal metal and Permalloy (Py, Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$) as ferromagnetic metal. The spin current was generated by the spin pumping effect with ferromagnetic resonance. The samples were deposited by dc magnetron sputtering at room temperature on Si (001) substrates. The three bilayers of Nb/Py, Mo/Py and Bi/Py had a spin-orbit coupling large enough to observe the voltage generation by spin Hall effect</description>

      <title>Interfacial magnetic spin Hall effect in van der Waals Fe3GeTe2/MoTe2 heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Hall effect (SHE) allows efficient generation of spin polarization or spin current through charge current and plays a crucial role in the development of spintronics. While SHE typically occurs in non-magnetic materials and is time-reversal even, exploring time-reversal-odd (T-odd) SHE, which couples SHE to magnetization in ferromagnetic materials, offers a new charge-spin conversion mechanism with new functionalities. Here, we report the observation of giant T-odd SHE in Fe3GeTe2/MoTe2 van der Waals heterostructure, representing a previously unidentified interfacial magnetic spin Hall effect (interfacial-MSHE). Through rigorous symmetry analysis and theoretical calculations, we attribute the interfacial-MSHE to a symmetry-breaking induced spin current dipole at the vdW interface. Furthermore, we show that this linear effect can be used for implementing multiply-accumulate operations and binary convolutional neural networks with cascaded multi-terminal devices. Our findings uncover an interfacial T-odd charge-spin conversion mechanism with promising potential for energy-efficient in-memory computing.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Topology with Generalized Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of chiral symmetry applicable to non-Hermitian systems and its topological consequences on one-dimensional chains. We uncover a rich family of topological phases hosting several chiral flavors characterized not by a single winding number, but a vector of of them. This, in turn, leads to a novel type of bulk-boundary correspondence, where -- in contrast with conventional chiral chains -- some flavors can have topologically stable non-zero charges on both ends. Moreover, we find that the total charge of each flavor can in some cases exceed the magnitude of the highest winding number in the vector invariant. Our work extends the topological classification of the non-Hermitian AIII class along a new axis.</description>

      <title>Classical dynamics and semiclassical analysis of excitons in cuprous oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, as bound states of electrons and holes, embody the solid state analogue of the hydrogen atom, whose quantum spectrum is explained within a classical framework by the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model. In a first hydrogenlike approximation the spectra of excitons are also well described by a Rydberg series, however, due to the surrounding crystal environment deviations from this series can be observed. A theoretical treatment of excitons in cuprous oxide needs to include the band structure of the crystal, leading to a prominent fine-structure splitting in the quantum spectra. This is achieved by introducing additional spin degrees of freedom into the system, making the existence and meaningfulness of classical exciton orbits in the physical system a non-trivial question. Recently, we have uncovered the contributions of periodic exciton orbits directly in the quantum mechanical recurrence spectra of cuprous oxide [J. Ertl et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067401 (2022)] by application of a scaling technique and fixing the energy of the classical dynamics to a value corresponding to a principle quantum number $n=5$ in the hydrogenlike case. Here, we present a comprehensive derivation of the classical and semiclassical theory of excitons in cuprous oxide. In particular, we investigate the energy dependence of the exciton dynamics. Both the semiclassical and quantum mechanical recurrence spectra exhibit stronger deviations from the hydrogenlike behavior with decreasing energy, which is related to a growing influence of the spin-orbit coupling and thus a higher velocity of the secular motion of the exciton orbits. The excellent agreement between semiclassical and quantum mechanical exciton recurrence spectra demonstrates the validity of the classical and semiclassical approach to excitons in cuprous oxide.</description>

      <title>Bulk-entanglement-spectrum correspondence in $PT$- and $PC$-symmetric topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss a new type of bulk-boundary correspondence which holds for topological insulators when the parity-time ($PT$) and/or parity-particle-hole ($PC$) symmetry are present. In these systems, even when the bulk topology is nontrivial, the edge spectrum is generally gapped, and thus the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold. We find that, instead of the edge spectrum, the single-particle entanglement spectrum becomes gapless when the bulk topology is nontrivial: i.e., the {\it bulk-entanglement-spectrum correspondence} holds in $PT$- and/or $PC$-symmetric topological insulators. After showing the correspondence using $K$-theoretic approach, we provide concrete models for each symmetry class up to three dimensions where nontrivial topology due to $PT$ and/or $PC$ is expected. An implication of our results is that, when the bulk topology under $PT$ and/or $PC$ symmetry is nontrivial, the many-body entanglement spectrum is multiply degenerate in one dimension and is gapless in two or higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generalized bulk-boundary correspondence in periodically driven non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of the periodically driven non-Hermitian systems, particularly on the rich interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and the topology. We start by reviewing the non-Bloch band theory of the static non-Hermitian systems and discuss the establishment of its generalized bulk-boundary correspondence. Ultimately, we focus on the non-Bloch band theory of two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems: harmonically driven non-Hermitian system and periodically quenched non-Hermitian system. The non-Bloch topological invariants were defined on the generalized Brillouin zone and the real space wave functions to characterize the Floquet non-Hermtian topological phases. Then, the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence was established for the two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, we review novel phenomena in the higher-dimensional periodically driven non-Hermitian systems, including Floquet non-Hermitian higher-order topological phases and Floquet hybrid skin-topological modes. The experimental realizations and recent advances have also been surveyed. Finally, we end with a summarization and hope this pedagogical review can motivate further research on Floquet non-Hermtian topological physics.</description>

      <title>Rashba spin splitting-induced topological Hall effect in a Dirac semimetal-ferromagnetic semiconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a concerted theory-experiment effort to investigate the formation of chiral real space spin texture when the archetypal Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ is interfaced with In$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As, a ferromagnetic semiconductor with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our calculations reveal a nonzero off-diagonal spin susceptibility in the Cd$_3$As$_2$ layer due to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling from broken inversion symmetry. This implies the presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between local moments in the In$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As layer, mediated by Dirac electrons in the vicinal Cd$_3$As$_2$ layer, potentially creating the conditions for a real space chiral spin texture. Using electrical magnetoresistance measurements at low temperature, we observe an emergent excess contribution to the transverse magneto-resistance whose behavior is consistent with a topological Hall effect arising from the formation of an interfacial chiral spin texture. This excess Hall voltage varies with gate voltage, indicating a promising electrostatically-tunable platform for understanding the interplay between the helical momentum space states of a Dirac semimetal and chiral real space spin textures in a ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Anomalous terahertz photoconductivity caused by the superballistic flow of hydrodynamic electrons in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light incident upon materials can induce changes in their electrical conductivity, a phenomenon referred to as photoresistance. In semiconductors, the photoresistance is negative, as light-induced promotion of electrons across the band gap enhances the number of charge carriers participating in transport. In superconductors, the photoresistance is positive because of the destruction of the superconducting state, whereas in normal metals it is vanishing. Here we report a qualitative deviation from the standard behavior in metallic graphene. We show that Dirac electrons exposed to continuous wave (CW) terahertz (THz) radiation can be thermally decoupled from the lattice by 50~K which activates hydrodynamic electron transport. In this regime, the resistance of graphene constrictions experiences a decrease caused by the THz-driven superballistic flow of correlated electrons. We analyze the dependencies of the negative photoresistance on the carrier density, and the radiation power and show that our superballistic devices operate as sensitive phonon-cooled bolometers and can thus offer a picosecond-scale response time. Beyond their fundamental implications, our findings underscore the practicality of electron hydrodynamics in designing ultra-fast THz sensors and electron thermometers.</description>

      <title>Electro-optic properties from ab initio calculations in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optic (EO) effects relate the change of optical constants by low-frequency electric fields. Thanks to the advent of Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT), the EO properties of bulk three-dimensional (3D) materials can now be calculated in an ab initio way. However, the use of periodic boundary conditions in most Density Functional Theory codes imposes to simulate two-dimensional (2D) materials using slabs surrounded by a large layer of vacuum. The EO coefficients predicted from such calculations, if not rescaled properly, can severely deviate from the real EO properties of 2D materials. The present work discusses the issue and introduces the rescaling relationships allowing to recover the true EO properties.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticles of NbC produced by laser ablation in liquid: a study of structural, magnetic and superconductivity properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Niobium carbide (NbC) is a high-field Type II superconductor with a critical temperature ($T_C$) of 11.1 K, just above that of pure Nb ($T_C = 9$ K). Downsizing NbC to the nanoparticle scale introduces significant alterations in its critical field and/or the superconducting temperature. Here we report on superconducting NbC nanoparticles with $T_C \approx$ 10 K synthesized by laser ablation in acetone, using the lens-target distance (laser fluence) and centrifugation as control parameters of the particle size. X-ray diffraction analyses certified the cubic NbC phase and electron microscopy images revealed spherical particles with average size near 8 nm, with no apparent size dependence on fluence. Besides, magnetization curves exhibited magnetic loops featuring a saturation magnetization around $10^{-3} \mu_B$/molecule along with a small and typical superconducting loop for all investigated samples. We also observed a suppression of the diamagnetic behavior below $T_C$ upon decreasing laser fluence. Moreover, all samples exhibited a weak electron spin resonance (ESR) Curie-like signal at $g\approx2.0$ probably associated with localized defects in the particle's surface. The intriguing coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in nanoparticles has recently garnered significant research attention. This complex scenario and unique properties are due to the substantial increase of surface-to-volume ratio in these superconducting NbC nanoparticles and further investigation would be crucial to unveil novel material properties and shed new light on our understanding of the superconducting phenomenon in this new morphology.</description>

      <title>Band engineering and study of disorder using topology in compact high kinetic inductance cavity arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting microwave metamaterials offer enormous potential for quantum optics and information science, enabling the development of advanced quantum technologies for sensing and amplification. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, such metamaterials can be implemented as coupled cavity arrays (CCAs). In the continuous effort to miniaturize quantum devices for increasing scalability, minimizing the footprint of CCAs while preserving low disorder becomes paramount. In this work, we present a compact CCA architecture leveraging superconducting NbN thin films presenting high kinetic inductance, which enables high-impedance CCA ($\sim1.5$ k$\Omega$), while reducing the resonator footprint. We demonstrate its versatility and scalability by engineering one-dimensional CCAs with up to 100 resonators and exhibiting multiple bandgaps. Additionally, we quantitatively investigate disorder in the CCAs using symmetry-protected topological SSH modes, from which we extract a resonator frequency scattering of $0.22^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\%$. Our platform opens up exciting new prospects for analog quantum simulations of many-body physics with ultrastrongly coupled emitters.</description>

      <title>Scaling Enhancement of Photon Blockade in Output Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade enhancement is an exciting and promising subject that has been well studied for photons in cavities. However, whether photon blockade can be enhanced in the output fields remains largely unexplored. We show that photon blockade can be greatly enhanced in the mixing output field of a nonlinear cavity and an auxiliary (linear) cavity, where no direct coupling between the nonlinear and auxiliary cavities is needed. We uncover a biquadratic scaling relation between the second-order correlation of the photons in the output field and intracavity nonlinear interaction strength, in contrast to a quadratic scaling relation for the photons in a nonlinear cavity. We identify that this scaling enhancement of photon blockade in the output field is induced by the destructive interference between two of the paths for two photons passing through the two cavities. We then extend the theory to the experimentally feasible Jaynes-Cummings model consisting of a two-level system strongly coupled to one of the two uncoupled cavities, and also predict a biquadratic scaling law in the mixing output field. Our proposed scheme is universal and can be extended to enhance blockade in other bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to conductivity in the Holstein model: A numerical-analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble) approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections. Their importance remains elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the values of model parameters.</description>

Abstract: Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Full quantitative near-field characterization of strongly coupled exciton-plasmon polaritons in thin-layered WSe2 on a monocrystalline gold platelet</title>

Abstract: Exciton-plasmon polaritons (EPPs) are attractive both for the exploration of fundamental phenomena and applications in nanophotonics. Previous studies of EPPs mainly relied on far-field characterization. Here, using near-field optical microscopy, we quantitatively characterize the dispersion of EPPs existing in 13-nm-thick tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) deposited on a monocrystalline gold platelet. We extract from our experimental data a Rabi splitting of 81 meV, and an experimental effective polariton loss of 55 meV, demonstrating that our system is in the strong-coupling regime. Furthermore, we measure for the first time at visible wavelengths the propagation length of these EPPs for each excitation energy of the dispersion relation. To demonstrate the quantitative nature of our near-field method to obtain the full complex-valued wavevector of EPPs, we use our near-field measurements to predict, via the transfer matrix method, the far-field reflectivities across the exciton resonance. These predictions are in excellent agreement with our experimental far-field measurements. Our findings open the door towards the full near-field study of light-manipulating devices at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Ray Polaritons in Twisted Asymmetric Stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons - light coupled to matter excitations - offers a plethora of different possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the subwavelength-scale. In particular, the development of twistoptics - the study of the optical properties of twisted stacks of vdW materials - allows the directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, which has been coined as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of nanoscale unidirectional propagation that naturally emerges thanks to twistoptics: unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). This natural phenomenon arises in two types of twisted hyperbolic stacks: homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, each with very different thicknesses of its constituents. URPs are characterized by the absence of diffraction and the presence of a single phase of the propagating field. Importantly, we demonstrate that this ray behavior can be tuned by means of both relative twist angle and illumination frequency variations. Additionally, an unprecedented "pinwheel-like" propagation emerges at specific twist angles of the homostructure. We show that URPs emerge due to the twist between asymmetrically stacked biaxial slabs, while the shear effect in monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is of minor importance. Our findings demonstrate a natural way to excite unidirectional ray-like PhPs and offer a unique platform for controlling the propagation of PhPs at the nanoscale with many potential applications like nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.</description>

      <title>IR Spectroscopy of Carboxylate-Passivated Semiconducting Nanocrystals: Simulation and Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surfaces of colloidal nanocrystals are frequently passivated with carboxylate ligands which exert significant effects on their optoelectronic properties and chemical stability. Experimentally, binding geometries of such ligands are typically investigated using vibrational spectroscopy, but the interpretation of the IR signal is usually not trivial. Here, using machine-learning (ML) algorithms trained on DFT data, we simulate an IR spectrum of a lead-rich PbS nanocrystal passivated with butyrate ligands. We obtain a good agreement with the experimental signal and demonstrate that the observed line shape stems from a very wide range of `tilted-bridge'-type geometries and does not indicate a coexistence of `bridging' and `chelating' binding modes as has been previously assumed. This work illustrates limitations of empirical spectrum assignment and demonstrates the effectiveness of ML-driven molecular dynamics simulations in reproducing IR spectra of nanoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Structure and thermodynamics of supported lipid membranes on hydrophobic van der Waals surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the adsorption and physical characteristics of supported lipid membranes is crucial for their effective use as model cell membranes. Their morphological and thermodynamic properties at the nanoscale have traditionally been studied on hydrophilic substrates, such as mica and silicon oxide, which have proved to facilitate the reconstruction of biomembranes. However, in more recent years, with the advent of the van der Waals crystals technology, two-dimensional crystals such as graphene have been proposed as potential substrates in biosensing devices. Membranes formed on these crystals are expected to behave differently owing to their intrinsic hydrophobicity, however thus far knowledge of their morphological and thermodynamic properties is lacking. Here we present a comprehensive nanoscale analysis of the adsorption of phosphatidylcholine lipid monolayers on two of the most commonly used van der Waals crystals, graphite and hexagonal boron nitride. Both morphological and thermodynamic properties of the lipid membranes were investigated using temperature-controlled atomic force microscopy. Our experiments show that the lipids adsorb onto the crystals, forming monolayers with their orientation dependent upon their concentration. Furthermore, we found that the hydrophobicity of van der Waals crystals determines a strong increase in the transition temperature of the lipid monolayer compared to that observed on hydrophilic substrates. These results are important for understanding the properties of lipid membranes at solid surfaces and extending their use to novel drug delivery and biosensing devices made of van der Waals crystals.</description>

      <title>Signatures of electronic ordering in transport in graphene flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a wide family of electronic orders was unveiled in graphene flat bands, such as spin- and valley-polarized phases as well as nematic momentum-polarized phases, stabilized by exchange interactions via a generalized Stoner mechanism. Momentum polarization involves orbital degrees of freedom and is therefore expected to impact resistivity in a way which is uniquely sensitive to the ordering type. Under pocket polarization, carrier distribution shifts in k space and samples the band mass in regions defined by the displaced momentum distribution. This makes transport coefficients sensitive to pocket polarization, resulting in the ohmic resistivity decreasing with temperature. In addition, it leads to current switching and hysteresis under strong E field. This behavior remains robust in the presence of electron-phonon scattering and is therefore expected to be generic.</description>

      <title>Role of the Berry curvature on BCS-type superconductivity in two-dimensional materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate how the Berry curvature, which arises in multi-band structures when the electrons can be described by an effective single-band Hamiltonian, affects the superconducting properties of two-dimensional electronic systems. Generically the Berry curvature is coupled to electric fields beyond those created by the periodic crystal potential. A potential source of such electric fields, which vary slowly on the lattice scale, is the mutual interaction between the electrons. We show that the Berry curvature provides additional terms in the Hamiltonian describing interacting electrons within a single band. When these terms are taken into account in the framework of the usual BCS weak-coupling treatment of a generic attractive interaction that allows for the formation of Cooper pairs, the coupling constant is modified. In pure singlet and triplet superconductors, we find that the Berry curvature generally lowers the coupling constant and thus the superconducting gap and the critical temperature as a function of doping. From an experimental point of view, a measured deviation from the expected BCS critical temperature upon doping, e.g. in doped two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, may unveil the strength of the Berry curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, aging effects occurring in multilayer systems attract much attention from researchers. In our research we looked at the behavior of multilayer systems that depend on anisotropy, magnetoresistance and susceptibility.All these parameters are interrelated and have varying degrees of influence on the effects of aging. We researched our Co-layers magnetic system from high-temperature and low-temperature initial states, as well as not only in the critical temperature region, but in a wide low-temperature range. The study was carried out with different types of magnetic anisotropy, which made it possible to identify differences in the behavior of the system depending on the type of anisotropy. We found that in systems exhibiting a dimensional transition, aging effects manifest to gain and themselves in a wide low-temperature range, and not only in a narrow near-critical region, which ultimately leads us to a wide range of applications of these materials for practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Topological bandstructures interfering with moir\'e superstructures give rise to a plethora of emergent phenomena, which are pivotal for correlated insulating and superconducting states of twisttronics materials. While quasiperiodicity was up to now a notion mostly reserved for solid-state materials and cold atoms, we here demonstrate the capacity of conventional superconducting circuits to emulate moir\'e physics in charge space. With two examples, we show that Hofstadter's butterfly and the magic-angle effect, are directly visible in spectroscopic transport measurements. Importantly, these features survive in the presence of harmonic trapping potentials due to parasitic linear capacitances. Our proposed platform benefits from unprecedented tuning capabilities, and opens the door to probe incommensurate physics in virtually any spatial dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular, their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological orders with distance-dependent interacting anyons. As we illustrate, in some instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by performing dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders. Our approach enables a general method for mapping generic Landau-type theories to dual models with topological order of the same spatial dimension. The low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal effects than those of surface codes.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio transport theory for the intrinsic spin Hall effect applied to 5$d$ metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how the spin Hall effect (SHE) can be studied from ab-initio by combining density functional theory with the non-equilibrium Green's functions technique for quantum transport into the so-called DFT+NEGF method. After laying down our theoretical approach in particular discussing how to compute charge and spin bond currents, DFT+NEGF calculations are carried out for ideal clean systems. In these the transport is ballistic and the linear response limit is met. The SHE emerges in a central region attached to two leads when we apply a bias voltage so that electrons are accelerated by a uniform electric field. As a result, we obtain a finite spin-Hall current and, by performing a scaling analysis with respect to the system size, we estimate the ballistic spin Hall conductivity (SHC). We consider 5d metals with fcc and bcc crystal structures, finding that the SHC exhibits a rough qualitative dependence on the d-band filling, and comment on these results in relation to existing literature. Finally, within the same DFT+NEGF approach, we also predict the appearance of a current-induced spin dipole moment inside the materials' unit cell and estimate its magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Integration of 2D semiconductors with photonic crystal slabs provides an attractive approach to achieve strong light--matter coupling and exciton-polariton formation in a planar chip-compatible geometry. However, for the development of practical devices, it is crucial that the polariton excitations in the structure are easily tunable and exhibit strong nonlinear response. Here we study neutral and charged exciton-polaritons in an electrostatically gated planar photonic crystal slab with an embedded monolayer semiconductor MoSe$_2$ and experimentally demonstrate strong polariton nonlinearity, which can be tuned via gate voltage. We find that modulation of dielectric environment within the photonic crystal results in the formation of two distinct resonances with significantly different nonlinear response, which enables optical switching with ultrashort laser pulses. Our results open new avenues towards development of active polaritonic devices in a compact chip-compatible implementation.</description>

Abstract: The electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces plays a key role in the properties of quantum devices. Here, we study the electronic structure of realistic Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and state-of-the-art quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) calculations. We find a good agreement between QS$GW$ calculations and hybrid functional calculations which themselves compare favourably well with ARPES experiments. Our study confirm the need of well controlled quality of the interfaces to obtain the needed properties of InAs/Al heterojunctions. A detailed analysis of the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the spin-splitting of the electronic states show a linear scaling in $k$-space, related to the two-dimensional nature of some interface states. The good agreement by QS$GW$ and hybrid functional calculations open the door towards trust-able use of an effective approximation to QS$GW$ for studying very large heterojunctions.</description>

Abstract: Topological superconductors support Majorana modes, which are quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles and which obey non-Abelian statistics in which successive exchanges of particles do not always commute. Here we investigate whether a two-dimensional superconductor with ordinary s-wave pairing can be rendered topological by the application of a strong magnetic field. To address this, we obtain the self-consistent solutions to the mean field Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which are a large set of nonlinearly coupled equations, for electrons moving on a lattice. We find that the topological "quantum Hall superconductivity" is facilitated by a combination of spin-orbit coupling, which locks an electron's spin to its momentum as it moves through a material, and a coupling to an external periodic potential which gives a dispersion to the Landau levels and also distorts the Abrikosov lattice. We find that, for a range of parameters, the Landau levels broadened by the external periodic potential support topological superconductivity, which is typically accompanied by a lattice of "giant" $h/e$ vortices as opposed to the familiar lattice of $h/2e$ Abrikosov vortices. In the presence of a periodic potential, we find it necessary to use an ansatz for the pairing potential of the form $\Delta(\vec{r})e^{i2\vec{Q}\cdot\vec{r}}$ where $\Delta(\vec{r})$ has a periodicity commensurate with the periodic potential. However, despite this form of the pairing potential, the current in the ground state is zero. In the region of ordinary superconductivity, we typically find a lattice of dimers of $h/2e$ vortices. Our work suggests a realistic proposal for achieving topological superconductivity, as well as a helical order parameter and unusual Abrikosov lattices.</description>

Abstract: The recently introduced topological heavy fermion model (THFM) provides a means for interpreting the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom of the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene as hybridization amidst highly dispersing topological conduction and weakly dispersing localized heavy fermions. In order to understand the Landau quantization of the ensuing electronic spectrum, a generalization of THFM to include the magnetic field B is desired, but currently missing. Here we provide a systematic derivation of the THFM in B and solve the resulting model to obtain the interacting Hofstadter spectra for single particle charged excitations. While naive minimal substitution within THFM fails to correctly account for the total number of magnetic subbands within the narrow band i.e. its total Chern number, our method -- based on projecting the light and heavy fermions onto the irreducible representations of the magnetic translation group -- reproduces the correct total Chern number. Analytical results presented here offer an intuitive understanding of the nature of the (strongly interacting) Hofstadter bands.</description>

Abstract: Parafermion zero modes can arise in hybrid structures composed of $\nu=1/m$ fractional quantum Hall edges proximitized with an s-wave superconductor. Here we consider parafermion and Cooper pair tunneling, and backscattering in a junction formed in such hybrid structures. We find that the $4\pi m$ periodicity due to parafermion-only tunneling reduces, in the presence of backscattering, to $4\pi$-periodic at zero temperature and $2\pi$-periodic at finite temperature unless the fermion parity is fixed. Nevertheless, a clear signature of parafermion tunneling remains in the shape of the current-phase relation.</description>

      <title>On the Adequacy of the Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Low Density and Dirac Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11693</link>

Abstract: The qualitative reliability of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) is investigated for systems in which either the actual carrier density or the effective carrier density is low, by comparing the exact perturbative and dynamical mean field expressions of electron scattering rates and optical conductivities. We study two interacting systems: tight binding models in which the chemical potential is near a band edge and Dirac systems in which the chemical potential is near the Dirac point. In both systems it is found that DMFT underestimates the low frequency, near-Fermi surface single particle scattering rate by a factor proportional to the particle density. The quasiparticle effective mass is qualitatively incorrect for the low density tight binding model but not necessarily for Dirac systems. The dissipative part of the optical conductivity is more subtle: in the exact calculation vertex corrections, typically neglected in DMFT calculations, suppress the low frequency optical absorption, compensating for some of the DMFT underestimate of the scattering rate. The role of vertex corrections in calculating the conductivity for Dirac systems is clarified and a systematic discussion is given of the approach to the Galilean/Lorentz invariant low density limit. Relevance to recent calculations related to Weyl metals is discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear behavior of memristive devices for hardware security primitives and neuromorphic computing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04848</link>

Abstract: Nonlinearity is a crucial characteristic for implementing hardware security primitives or neuromorphic computing systems. The main feature of all memristive devices is this nonlinear behavior observed in their current-voltage characteristics. To comprehend the nonlinear behavior, we have to understand the coexistence of resistive, capacitive, and inertia (virtual inductive) effects in these devices. These effects originate from corresponding physical and chemical processes in memristive devices. A physics-inspired compact model is employed to model and simulate interface-type RRAMs such as Au/BiFeO$_{3}$/Pt/Ti, Au/Nb$_{\rm x}$O$_{\rm y}$/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Nb, while accounting for the modeling of capacitive and inertia effects. The simulated current-voltage characteristics align well with experimental data and accurately capture the non-zero crossing hysteresis generated by capacitive and inductive effects. This study examines the response of two devices to increasing frequencies, revealing a shift in their nonlinear behavior characterized by a reduced hysteresis range and increased chaotic behavior, as observed through internal state attractors. Fourier series analysis utilizing a sinusoidal input voltage of varying amplitudes and frequencies indicates harmonics or frequency components that considerably influence the functioning of RRAMs. Moreover, we propose and demonstrate the use of the frequency spectra as one of the fingerprints for memristive devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Boundary Modes in Nonlinear Dynamics with Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry play a pivotal role in multiple areas of physics, yet they remain unstudied in systems with nonlinear interactions whose nonlinear normal modes do not exhibit $\textbf{U}(1)$-gauge symmetry. In this work, we establish particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry in such systems. Chiral symmetry ensures the quantization of the Berry phase of nonlinear normal modes and categorizes the topological phases of nonlinear dynamics. We show topologically protected static boundary modes in chiral-symmetric nonlinear systems. Our theoretical framework extends particle-hole and chiral symmetries to nonlinear dynamics, whose nonlinear modes do not necessarily yield $\textbf{U}(1)$-gauge symmetry.</description>
