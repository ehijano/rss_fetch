      <title>Higgs Branches in the Omega-background via the Category of Line Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vacuum manifold $\mathcal{M}$ of a topological twist of a 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory is a hyper-K\"ahler variety; deformations and quantizations of $\mathcal{M}$ can be constructed in the framework of 3 dimensional topological quantum field theories. In particular, based on physics arguments, turning on an omega-background results in the quantization of $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{M}]$ as a Poisson algebra. In this paper, we implement this idea mathematically, in the context of the B-twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, namely for Higgs branches. Our strategy is to implement omega-background in the category of line operators via the choice of a ribbon twist, and obtain the quantum Hamiltonian reduction as derived endomorphisms in the equivariant category, the category where the ribbon twist acts trivially. We apply quadratic Koszul duality to perform this computation.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous SSH models and the doubling of orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.</description>

      <title>Exponential Suppression of Transport in Electric Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish exact scalings for the maximal group velocity of translation-invariant quantum walks in periodic electric fields. Our main result shows that the maximal group velocity decays exponentially with the period of the field in the whole parameter range, thus affirming a conjecture of arXiv:2302.01869 and at the same time augmenting it to an exact equality. We further demonstrate explicit revival relations and characterize the absolutely continuous spectrum in these models. Our results apply directly also to generalized CMV matrices.</description>

      <title>An Error Correctable Implication Algebra for a System of Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Lukasiewicz logic as a viable system for an implication algebra on a system of qubits. Our results show that the three valued Lukasiewicz logic can be embedded in the stabilized space of an arbitrary quantum error correcting stabilizer code. We then fully characterize the non trivial errors that may occur up to group isomorphism. Lastly, we demonstrate by explicit algorithmic example, how any algorithm consistent with the Lukasiewicz logic can immediately run on a quantum system and utilize the indeterminate state.</description>

      <title>Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman geometry and quasinonexpansive operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain an array of new results in the theory of Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman relative entropies and quasinonexpansive operators on reflexive Banach spaces, and we also develop an extension of this theory to nonreflexive Banach spaces, providing a joint generalisation of the reflexive approach with the finite-dimensional information geometric approach. In the reflexive case, we study generalised pythagorean inequality, as well as norm-to-norm, uniform, and Lipschitz--H\"{o}lder continuity of entropic projections, proximal maps, and resolvents. We also provide a detailed account of the family of Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman geometries that are naturally encoding the geometric properties of the underlying Banach space norm. The extended theory belongs to the intersection of convex theoretic and homeomorphic approaches to nonlinear analysis. Its models are constructed using integration theory on order unit spaces. Our main focus is on geometry of, and nonlinear quasinonexpansive operators on, normal state spaces of JBW- and W*-algebras, modelled via nonlinear embeddings into reflexive rearrangement invariant spaces. For example, we analyse the extended Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman geometries induced by norm geometry of noncommutative and nonassociative L$_p$ spaces via Mazur embeddings, providing sufficient conditions for monoidal composability of extended quasinonexpansive operators, and computing the exponent parameters of Lipschitz--H\"{o}lder continuity of the corresponding extended entropic projections and resolvents. Other models feature the (commutative and noncommutative) Lozanovski\u{i} factorisation map, generalised spin factors, finite dimensional base normed spaces, and convex spectral functions on unitarily invariant ideals of compact operators. We also discuss several categories of entropic projections and quasinonexpansive operators naturally appearing in this framework.</description>

      <title>Sampling Polynomial Rational Remainders with SP$\mathbb{Q}$R: A new Package for Polynomial Division and Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SP$\mathbb{Q}$R, a new Mathematica package for the division and elimination of variables from polynomial systems. SP$\mathbb{Q}$R works by sampling and reconstructing results over finite fields, in an analogous manner to many state of the art Integration by Parts algorithms for Feynman integrals. This allows SP$\mathbb{Q}$R to effectively overcome expression swell during the construction of Gr\"obner bases, which in many cases is the major bottleneck in such computations. Benchmarks on state of the art Macaulay resultants show that SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can deliver substantial gains over symbolic computer algebra workflows -- reducing both runtime and memory footprint by multiple orders of magnitude. Likewise when applied to study Feynman integrals, we show how SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can be used to find previously unknown Landau singularities.</description>

      <title>Information Criteria Fail for Dynamical Systems: Sampling Rate and Dimension Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information criteria such as Akaike's (AIC) and Bayes' (BIC) are widely used for model selection in physics and beyond, quantifying the tradeoff between model complexity and goodness-of-fit to enforce parsimony. However, their derivation assumes uncorrelated samples, an assumption systematically violated by dynamical systems data. Here, through analysis of simple but representative dynamical models -- exponential decay, harmonic oscillation, and chaos -- we demonstrate that model selection depends sensitively on sampling rate and system dimensionality. We derive explicit formulas predicting when standard information criteria fail that should be adaptable to many real-world scenarios, enabling experimentalists to design sampling protocols that avoid pathological regimes.</description>

      <title>Unitary SUSY for the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that a unitary supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) involving graviton and gravitino fields on fixed 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_4$) cannot exist due to known challenges associated with supersymmetry (SUSY) on spaces with positive cosmological constant. In this talk, we contradict this expectation by presenting a new unitary supersymmetric QFT on fixed $dS_4$ : the free supersymmetric theory of the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino fields. The theory overcomes the known obstacles to unitary global SUSY on de Sitter because the commutator between two SUSY transformations closes on the conformal algebra $so(4,2)$ rather than the de Sitter algebra $so(4,1)$. Crucially, the $so(4,2)$ symmetry is realised through unconventional conformal-like transformations. Based on arxiv:2503.04515.</description>

      <title>A note on the minimal pairwise distance in optimal Lennard-Jones $N$-body clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Good a-priori bounds on the smallest pairwise distance $r_{\rm{{min}}}(\mbox{LJ}_N^{\rm{gmin}})$ for a three-dimensional (3D) Lennard-Jones $N$-body cluster of globally minimal energy can significantly reduce the computational search space in the NP-hard problem to find this configuration. In this contribution the virial theorem is exploited for this purpose. We prove that if a configuration ${C}^{(N)}$ is a member of $\mbox{LJ}_N^{\rm{equ}}$ (the stationary points), then $r_{\rm{{min}}}({C}^{(N)}) \leq r_{\rm{{min}}}(\mbox{LJ}_2^{\rm{gmin}})$. It is also shown that if ${C}^{(N)}\in$ LJ$_N^{\rm{gmin}}\subset$ LJ$_N^{\rm{equ}}$, equality holds if and only if $N\in\{2,3,4\}$. We conjecture that $r_{\rm{{min}}}(\mbox{LJ}_N^{\rm{gmin}}) &gt;1$ in units for which $r_{\rm{{min}}}(\mbox{LJ}_2^{\rm{gmin}})= 2^\frac16 \approx 1.122462048$. This conjectured lower bound, if correct, would improve the best lower bound currently known, $r_{\rm{{min}}}(\mbox{LJ}_N^{\rm{gmin}})\geq 0.767764$, by about 25$\%$. In these units the smallest minimal pair distance found through numerical searches for LJ$_N^{\rm{gmin}}$ with $N\leq 1000$ is $r_{\rm{{min}}}(\mbox{LJ}_{923}^{\rm{gmin}}) \approx 1.01361$, so the conjectured lower bound would presumably be close to optimal. From the virial theorem we obtain an identity for any ${C}^{(N)}\in \mbox{LJ}_N^{\rm{equ}}$, which expresses $r_{\rm{{min}}}({C}^{(N)})$ in terms of the distribution of relative distances in ${C}^{(N)}$. This result reveals interesting connections with the Erd\H{o}s distance, and related problems.</description>

      <title>Modifications of Newtonian dynamics from higher moments of quantum spin connection in precanonical quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon previous work that derived an alternative to (galactic) dark matter in the form of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), with a specific theoretical interpolating function, from the motion of a non-relativistic test particle in the gravitational field of a point mass immersed in the non-relativistic static limit of the spin connection foam -- which represents the quantum analogue of Minkowski spacetime within precanonical quantum gravity -- we now show the consequences of using higher moments (third and fourth) of the corresponding geodesic equation with a random spin connection term. These higher moments lead to more general quantum modifications of the Newtonian potential (qMOND potentials expressed in terms of Gauss and Appell hypergeometric functions), more general (steeper) MOND interpolating functions, and a new modification of MOND at low accelerations (mMOND) that features an almost-flat asymptotic rotation curve $\propto r^{-1/18}$, which is expected to operate at approximately the same galactic scales as MOND.</description>

      <title>A construction of single-valued elliptic polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a general construction of single-valued elliptic polylogarithms as functions on the once-punctured elliptic curve. Our formalism is an extension of Brown's construction of genus-zero single-valued polylogarithms to the elliptic curve: the condition of trivial monodromy for solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation is expressed in terms of elliptic associators and involves two representations of a two-letter alphabet. Our elliptic single-valued condition reduces to Brown's genus-zero condition upon degeneration of the torus. We provide several examples for our construction, including the elliptic Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm.</description>

      <title>New algorithms for Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a detailed account of the algorithm outlined in [1] for Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations. The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, we use a new geometric order relation in the integration-by-parts reduction to obtain a basis of master integrals, whose differential equations are of a Laurent polynomial form in the regularisation parameter $\varepsilon$ and compatible with a filtration. This step works entirely with rational functions. In a second step, we provide a method to $\varepsilon$-factorise the aforementioned Laurent differential equations. The second step may introduce algebraic and transcendental functions. We illustrate the versatility of the algorithm by applying it to different examples with a wide range of complexity.</description>

      <title>Transformations of the 2-component BKP tau functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2-component BKP (2-BKP) hierarchy is an important integrable system corresponding to the infinite dimensional Lie algebras $b_{\infty}$ and $d_{\infty}$, which contains Novikov-Veselov equation and can be used to describe the total descendent potential of D type singularity. Here we firstly introduce the projections of the mixed pseudo-differential operators to rewrite the 2-BKP Lax equation in the Shiota construction, where the scalar Lax operators involving two differential operators $\partial_1$ and $\partial_2$ are used. Based upon this, the $(M_1,M_2)$-reduction of the 2-BKP hierarchy is given. After that, we give the most important result of this paper, i.e., the transformations of the 2-BKP tau functions, which are in fact the 2-BKP Darboux transformations. Here we further give the corresponding changes in the 2-BKP Lax operators. Also the corresponding results are investigated for the reduction case. Finally, the additional symmetries can be viewed as the special cases of the transformations of the 2-BKP tau functions. Besides, we discuss the Pfaffian identities of the 2-BKP tau functions by successive applications of the above transformations, which are closely related with the 2-BKP addition formulae.</description>

      <title>On Moffatt's magnetic relaxation for 2D and 2.5D flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Moffatt's magnetic relaxation equation with Darcy-type regularization for the constitutive law. This is a topology-preserving dissipative equation, whose solutions are conjectured to converge in the infinite time limit towards equilibria of the incompressible Euler equations. Our goal is to prove this conjectured property for various equilibria in various domains. The first result concerns a class of non-constant shear flows in a 2D periodic channel. In the second result, by adopting a geometric approach, we address a class of 2.5D equilibria in $\Omega\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ can be a periodic channel or any bounded domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly compute the spectral metric, torsion and Einstein tensors for a nontrivial spectral triple on a noncommutative torus, with the Dirac operator related to the fully equivariant Dirac by a partial conformal rescaling (as introduced in [1]). The results show that the spectral triple has vanishing torsion and the Einstein tensor also identically vanishes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a unified treatment of the local well-posedness for the wave kinetic equation in almost critical weighted $L^r$ spaces with $2 \leq r \leq \infty.$ The proof builds on ideas from our earlier works \cite{AmLe24, AmLemain25}. Our approach is based solely on kinetic tools, with no appeal to Fourier theory.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Renormalisation: A Categorical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a categorical formulation of the Hamiltonian renormalisation programme for quantum field theories, establishing a systematic bridge between functional and lattice renormalisation. To this end, we introduce two categories, $Seq$ and $Func$, whose objects correspond to resolution spaces at different ultraviolet scales, and whose morphisms encode embeddings, projections, coarse-graining maps, and discrete derivatives.
  Focusing on Dirichlet-type embeddings, we construct the corresponding subcategories $Seq_D$, $Func_D$ and prove that the embedding and its adjoint define functors between them.
  Furthermore we revisit and extend the analysis of the convergence rate to the fixed point for the couplings of the $U(1)^3$ model for $3+1$ Euclidean quantum gravity, analysing different combinations of Haar and Dirichlet embeddings.</description>

Abstract: We consider periodic (pseudo)differential {elliptic operators of Schr\"odinger type} perturbed by weak magnetic fields not vanishing at infinity, and extend our previous analysis in \cite{CIP,CHP-2,CHP-4} to the case {of a semimetal having a finite family of Bloch eigenvalues whose range may overlap with the other Bloch bands but remains isolated at each fixed quasi-momentum.} We do not make any assumption of triviality for the associated Bloch bundle. In this setting, we formulate a general form of the Peierls-Onsager substitution {via strongly localized tight-frames and magnetic matrices. We also} prove the existence of an approximate time evolution for initial states supported inside the range of the isolated Bloch family, with a precise error control.</description>

      <title>Unified Structural Embedding of Orbifold Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a new unified structural framework for orbifold sigma models that incorporates twisted sectors, singularities, and smooth regions into a single algebraic object. Traditional approaches to orbifold theories often treat such sectors separately, requiring ad hoc regularizations near singularities and failing at capturing inter-sector interactions under renormalization group flow. Therefore, the scope of this study aims at resolving these limitations through the construction of a unified orbifold algebra $\mathcal{A}(X/G)$ that decomposes into idempotent-projected components corresponding to conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$ acting on the target space $X$. The formalism is shown to recover conventional sigma model results in the smooth limit where $G$ approaches the trivial group, with the internal renormalization group derivation reducing to the standard one-loop beta function proportional to the Ricci tensor. Examples demonstrate the applicability, including explicit calculations for the $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold that exhibit the decomposition into untwisted and twisted field contributions.</description>

      <title>Topological Invariants in Higher-Dimensional Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations possess three magnetic invariants: (M) magnetic helicity, (C) cross helicity, and (P) the mean-square magnetic potential, in addition to the fundamental invariants of fluid motion. In this paper we construct higher-dimensional generalizations of these invariants for ideal MHD. Specifically, we identify generalized magnetic helicity and generalized cross helicity in all odd spatial dimensions $n=2m+1$, and families of invariants given by integrals of arbitrary functions of the scalar density $B^m/\nu$ of the magnetic field $2$-form $B$, where $B^m$ denotes its $m$-fold wedge product and $\nu$ the fluid-density top form, in all even spatial dimensions $n=2m$. We further establish the existence of invariants for symmetric solutions in arbitrary dimensions, generalizing the mean-square magnetic potential and showing that this invariant arises from symmetry rather than from even dimensionality, in contrast to the enstrophy invariant of the two-dimensional Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Long-term behavior of the master equation on a countable network and approximation methods of the (stationary) solutions via finite subsystems in the thermodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Master equation on directed networks - also called the differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation - is a linear differential equation, which describes the probability evolution in a discrete system. While this is well understood, if the underlying graph is finite, the mathematics required for the treatment of a network with countable many nodes is way more complicated and advanced. In this paper we provide criteria for the rates of the system, which makes it possible to approximate the solution by finite subsystems in the thermodynamic limit. By writing the phase space as a direct sum of stationary states and states which vanish in the time limit, we give a new proof of when the time limit for an countable, infinite dimensional system exists and when it can be interchanged with the limit of large systems. We give sufficient criteria, when these two limits commute and demonstrate on various examples, what happens when these criteria are violated and only one of these limits exists.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Potential for Non-Ergodic Replication Dynamics:An Information-Theoretic Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to quantify and visualize the degradation of fidelity (information degradation) that inevitably accompanies the replication of information within the framework of information thermodynamics and to propose an information-theoretic formulation of the second law based on this phenomenon. While previous research in information thermodynamics has focused on the thermodynamic costs associated with information "erasure'' or "measurement'' through concepts such as Landauer's principle and mutual information, little systematic discussion has addressed the inherently irreversible nature of "replication'' itself and the accompanying degradation of information structure. In this study, we construct a mathematical model of information replication using a discrete Markov model and Gaussian convolution, and quantify changes in information at each replication step: Shannon entropy, cross-entropy, and the Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD). The monotonic decrease of KLD exhibits a Lyapunov-like property, which can be interpreted as a potential analogous to the free energy in the process by which a nonequilibrium system converges to a particular steady state. Furthermore, we extend this framework to the potential applicability to biological information processes such as DNA replication, showing that the free energy required for degradation and repair can be expressed in terms of KLD. This contributes to building a unified information-thermodynamic framework for operations such as replication, transmission, and repair of information.</description>

      <title>Globalization of perturbative Chern-Simons theory on the moduli space of flat connections in the BV formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the perturbative path integral of Chern-Simons theory (the effective BV action on zero-modes) in Lorenz gauge, expanded around a (possibly non-acyclic) flat connection, as a family over the smooth irreducible stratum $\mathcal{M}' \subset \mathcal{M}$ of the moduli space of flat connections. We prove that it is horizontal with respect to the Grothendieck connection up to a BV-exact term. From it, we construct a volume form on $\mathcal{M'}$ - the "global partition function" - whose cohomology class is independent of the metric, and so is a 3-manifold invariant.
  As an element of the construction, we construct an extension of the perturbative partition function to a nonhomogeneous form on the space of triples $(A,A',g)$ consisting of (1) a "kinetic" flat connection $A$ around which Chern-Simons action is expanded, (2) a "gauge-fixing" flat connection $A'$, (3) a metric $g$. This extension is horizontal with respect to an appropriate Gauss-Manin superconnection (which involves the BV operator as a degree zero component).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review 2d CFT in the bootstrap approach, and sketch the known exactly solvable CFTs with no extended chiral symmetry: Liouville theory, (generalized) minimal models, limits thereof, and loop CFTs, including the $O(n)$, Potts and $PSU(n)$ CFTs.
  Exact solvability relies on local conformal symmetry, and on the existence of degenerate fields. We show how these assumptions constrain the spectrum and correlation functions. We discuss how crossing symmetry equations can be solved analytically and/or numerically, leading to analytic expressions for structure constants in terms of the double Gamma function.
  In the case of loop CFTs, we sketch the corresponding statistical models, and derive the relation between statistical and CFT variables. We review the resulting combinatorial description of correlation functions, and discuss what remains to be done for solving the CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of the modulus of the extreme eigenvalues is investigated for the complex Ginibre and complex induced Ginibre ensembles in the limit of large dimensions of random matrices. The limiting distribution of the scaled spectral radius and the scaled minimum modulus for the complex induced Ginibre ensemble, with a proportional rectangularity index, is the Gumbel distribution. The independence of these extrema is established, at appropriate scaling, for large matrices from the complex Ginibre ensemble as well as from the complex induced Ginibre ensemble for fixed and proportional rectangularity indexes. In the limit of a large size of the complex Ginibre matrices, the left and right tail distributions of the minimum modulus are the Rayleigh and Weibull distributions, respectively. The limiting left tail distribution of the minimum modulus is the same for these non-Hermitian ensembles when the rectangularity index of the complex induced Ginibre ensemble is equal to zero. This phenomenon is also verified for the right tail distribution of this minimum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature does not readily provide, however, practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronization has been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model, we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on real connectome data, random graphs, and on stochastic block models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the inference problem of constraining the dipole amplitude with inclusive deep inelastic scattering data can be written into a discrete linear inverse problem, in an analogous manner as can be done for computed tomography. To this formulation of the problem, we apply standard inverse problems methods and algorithms to reconstruct known dipole amplitudes from simulated reduced cross section data with realistic precision. The main difference of this approach to previous works is that this implementation does not require any fit parametrization of the dipole amplitude. The freedom from parametrization also enables us for the first time to quantify the uncertainties of the inferred dipole amplitude in a novel more general framework. This mathematical approach to small-$x$ phenomenology opens a path to parametrization bias free inference of the dipole amplitude from HERA and Electron--Ion Collider data.</description>

      <title>Modelling optimal generation of an arbitrary N-qubit quantum gate within the generalized Bloch vectors formalism due to the Pontryagin principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of optimal generation of N-qubit gates for closed quantum systems -- a key task for the practical implementation of various quantum applications. Based on the generalized Bloch vectors formalism for a finite-dimensional quantum system, we develop a new optimal gates generation model, which is universal in the sense that it is applicable for an arbitrary N-qubit gate, any Hamiltonian of a closed N-qubit system and within this model an optimal control is determined only by N-qubit system parameters and does not depend on its initial state. Within the developed model, the synthesis of optimal control, carried out via the Pontryagin principle, leads to the boundary value problem for the system of ODEs, which can be explored by various computational methods. Numerical experiments conducted for generation of a variety of one/two/three qubit gates demonstrate viability of the developed optimal model which allows one to generate N-qubit quantum gates with a high degree of precision.</description>

      <title>A Lichnerowicz equation in the Einstein-scalar field theory on non-CMC closed manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we prove the existence of a positive and essentially bounded solution to a Lichnerowicz equation in the Einstein-scalar field theory on a closed manifold with non-constant mean curvature. In particular, the non-constant mean curvature gives rise to supercritical terms in the equation, on top of singular ones. We employ a recent fixed-point argument, which involves sub- and supersolutions. Additionally, we provide several conditions on the coefficients in the equation that prevent the existence of positive classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Short-time dynamics in phase-ordering kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and $\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent. These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.</description>

      <title>Integrability of a family of clean SYK models from the critical Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the integrability of a family of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models with uniform $p$-body interactions. We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.</description>
