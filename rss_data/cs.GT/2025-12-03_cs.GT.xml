      <title>Characterizing Off-Chain Influence Proof Transaction Fee Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roughgarden (2020) initiates the study of Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs), and posits that the on-chain game of a ``good'' TFM should be on-chain simple (OnCS), i.e., incentive compatible for users and the miner. Recent work of Ganesh, Thomas and Weinberg (2024) posits that they should additionally be Off-Chain Influence Proof (OffCIP), which means that the miner cannot achieve any additional revenue by separately conducting an off-chain auction to determine on-chain inclusion. They observe that a cryptographic second-price auction satisfies both properties, but leave open the question of whether other mechanisms (e.g, non-cryptographic) satisfy these properties.
  In this paper, we characterize OffCIP TFMs: They are those satisfying a burn identity relating the burn rule to the allocation rule. In particular, we show that auction is OffCIP if and only if its (induced direct-revelation) allocation rule $\bar{X}(\cdot)$ and burn rule $\bar{B}(\cdot)$ (both of which take as input users' values $v_1, \dots, v_n$) are truthful when viewing $\big(\bar{X}(\cdot), \bar{B}(\cdot)\big)$ as the allocation and pricing rule of a multi-item auction for a single additive buyer with values $\big(\varphi(v_1),\ldots, \varphi(v_n)\big)$ equal to the users' virtual values.
  Building on this burn identity, we characterize deterministic OffCIP and OnCS TFMs that do not use cryptography: They are posted-price mechanisms with specially-tuned burns. As a corollary, we show that such TFMs can only exist with infinite supply and prior-dependence. However, we show that for randomized TFMs, there are additional OnCS and OffCIP auctions that do not use cryptography (even when there is finite supply, under prior-dependence with a bounded prior distribution). Holistically, our results show that while OffCIP is a fairly stringent requirement, families of OffCIP mechanisms can be found for a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Posted Pricing for Online Selection: Limited Price Changes and Risk Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Posted-price mechanisms (PPMs) are a widely adopted strategy for online resource allocation due to their simplicity, intuitive nature, and incentive compatibility. To manage the uncertainty inherent in online settings, PPMs commonly employ dynamically increasing prices. While this adaptive pricing achieves strong performance, it introduces practical challenges: dynamically changing prices can lead to fairness concerns stemming from price discrimination and incur operational costs associated with frequent updates. This paper addresses these issues by investigating posted pricing constrained by a limited, pre-specified number of allowed price changes, denoted by $\Delta$. We further extend this framework by incorporating a second critical dimension: risk sensitivity. Instead of evaluating performance based solely on expectation, we utilize a tail-risk objective-specifically, the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of the total social welfare, parameterized by a risk level $\delta \in [0, 1]$.
  We formally introduce a novel problem class kSelection-$(\delta,\Delta)$ in online adversarial selection and propose a correlated PPM that utilizes a single random seed to correlate posted prices. This correlation scheme is designed to address both the limited price changes and simultaneously enhance the tail performance of the online algorithm. Our subsequent analysis provides performance guarantees under these joint constraints, revealing a clear trade-off between the number of allowed price changes and the algorithm's risk sensitivity. We also establish optimality results for several important special cases of the problem.</description>

      <title>Monotone Near-Zero-Sum Games: A Generalization of Convex-Concave Minimax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-sum and non-zero-sum (aka general-sum) games are relevant in a wide range of applications. While general non-zero-sum games are computationally hard, researchers focus on the special class of monotone games for gradient-based algorithms. However, there is a substantial gap between the gradient complexity of monotone zero-sum and monotone general-sum games. Moreover, in many practical scenarios of games the zero-sum assumption needs to be relaxed. To address these issues, we define a new intermediate class of monotone near-zero-sum games that contains monotone zero-sum games as a special case. Then, we present a novel algorithm that transforms the near-zero-sum games into a sequence of zero-sum subproblems, improving the gradient-based complexity for the class. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this new class to model practical scenarios of games motivated from the literature.</description>

      <title>How Market Volatility Shapes Algorithmic Collusion: A Comparative Analysis of Learning-Based Pricing Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous pricing algorithms are increasingly influencing competition in digital markets; however, their behavior under realistic demand conditions remains largely unexamined. This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.</description>

      <title>Localizing Preference Aggregation Conflicts: A Graph-Theoretic Approach Using Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a graph-theoretic framework based on discrete sheaves to diagnose and localize inconsistencies in preference aggregation. Unlike traditional linearization methods (e.g., HodgeRank), this approach preserves the discrete structure of ordinal preferences, identifying which specific voter interactions cause aggregation failure -- information that global methods cannot provide -- via the Obstruction Locus. We formalize the Incompatibility Index to quantify these local conflicts and examine their behavior under stochastic variations using the Mallows model. Additionally, we develop a rigorous sheaf-theoretic pushforward operation to model voter merging, implemented via a polynomial-time constraint DAG algorithm. We demonstrate that graph quotients transform distributed edge conflicts into local impossibilities (empty stalks), providing a topological characterization of how aggregation paradoxes persist across scales.</description>

      <title>Truthful and Trustworthy IoT AI Agents via Immediate-Penalty Enforcement under Approximate VCG Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of autonomous AI agents in Internet of Things (IoT) energy systems requires decision-making mechanisms that remain robust, efficient, and trustworthy under real-time constraints and imperfect monitoring. While reinforcement learning enables adaptive prosumer behaviors, ensuring economic consistency and preventing strategic manipulation remain open challenges, particularly when sensing noise or partial observability reduces the operator's ability to verify actions. This paper introduces a trust-enforcement framework for IoT energy trading that combines an approximate Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) double auction with an immediate one-shot penalty. Unlike reputation- or history-based approaches, the proposed mechanism restores truthful reporting within a single round, even when allocation accuracy is approximate and monitoring is noisy. We theoretically characterize the incentive gap induced by approximation and derive a penalty threshold that guarantees truthful bidding under bounded sensing errors. To evaluate learning-enabled prosumers, we embed the mechanism into a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment reflecting stochastic generation, dynamic loads, and heterogeneous trading opportunities. Experiments show that improved allocation accuracy reduces deviation incentives, the required penalty matches analytical predictions, and learned bidding behaviors remain stable and interpretable despite imperfect monitoring. These results demonstrate that lightweight penalty designs can reliably align strategic IoT agents with socially efficient energy-trading outcomes.</description>

Abstract: We present a polynomial-time reduction from max-plus-average constraints to the feasibility problem for semidefinite programs. This shows that Condon's simple stochastic games, stochastic mean payoff games, and in particular mean payoff games and parity games can all be reduced to semidefinite programming.</description>

      <title>Autocratic strategies in Cournot oligopoly game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An oligopoly is a market in which the price of goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in a one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players by enforcing linear relationships between payoffs. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game, and that they are quite different from those in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game. Especially, we prove that a fair zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the fair zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in the oligopoly market.</description>

      <title>The Active and Noise-Tolerant Strategic Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of active learning algorithms for classifying strategic agents. Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.
  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $\epsilon$ using only $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ label queries and incurs at most $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21].</description>
