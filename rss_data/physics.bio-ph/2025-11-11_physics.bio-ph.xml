      <title>Long-bone microanatomy in elephants: microstructural insights into gigantic beasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the greatest challenges of terrestrial locomotion is resisting gravity. The morphological adaptive features of the limb long-bones of extant elephants, the heaviest living terrestrial animals, have previously been highlighted; however, their bone microanatomy remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate the microanatomy of the six limb long-bones in Elephas maximus and Loxodonta africana, using comparisons of virtual slices as well as robustness analyses, to understand how they were adapted to heavy weight-bearing. We find that the long bones of elephant limbs display a relatively thick cortex and a medullary area almost entirely filled with trabecular bone. This trabecular bone is highly anisotropic with trabecular orientations reflecting the mechanical load distribution along the limb. The respective functional roles of the bones are reflected in their microanatomy through variations of cortical thickness distribution and main orientation of the trabeculae. We find microanatomical adaptations to heavy weight support that are common to other heavy mammals. Despite these shared characteristics, the long bones of elephants are closer to those of sauropods due to their shared columnar posture, which allows a relaxation of morphofunctional constraints, and thus relatively less robust bones with a thinner cortex than would be expected in such massive animals.</description>

      <title>Metabolic quantum limit and holographic bound to the information capacity of magnetoencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoencephalography, the noninvasive measurement of magnetic fields produced by brain activity, utilizes quantum sensors like superconducting quantum interference devices or atomic magnetometers. Here we derive a fundamental, technology-independent bound on the information that such measurements can convey. Using the energy resolution limit of magnetic sensing together with the brain's metabolic power, we obtain a universal expression for the maximum information rate, which depends only on geometry, metabolism, and Planck's constant, and the numerical value of which is 2.6 Mbit/s. At the high bandwidth limit we arrive at a bound scaling linearly with the area of the current source boundary. We thus demonstrate a biophysical holographic bound for metabolically powered information conveyed by the magnetic field. For the geometry and metabolic power of the human brain the geometric bound is 6.6 Gbit/s.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Tip: Lattice Dynamics, Seams, and the Mechanism of Microtubule Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural integrity of microtubules is paramount for cellular function. We present a theoretical analysis of their lattice fracture, focusing on the influence of multi-seam structures arising from monomer defects and aiming to provide a more accurate estimation of GDP lattice parameters. Our findings reveal that seams function as pre-existing pathways that accelerate damage propagation. Consequently, monomer vacancies destabilize the lattice due to the inherent structural loss of tubulin-tubulin contacts and the additive acceleration of fracture through multiple seams. Importantly, the comparison of our simulations with experiments on lattice fracture suggests that the intrinsic ratio of longitudinal to lateral binding energies is bounded at approximately 1.5, challenging previous predictions of lattice anisotropy from tip-growth models and highlighting the urgent need to incorporate into current growth models parameters obtained from lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-discontinuous DNA Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biological cells, DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a protein complex encompassing multiple DNA polymerases. DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Vaccine Prioritization via Non-Markovian Final-state Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective vaccine prioritization is critical for epidemic control, yet real outbreaks exhibit memory effects that inflate state space and make long-term prediction and optimization challenging. As a result, many strategies are tuned to short-term objectives and overlook how vaccinating certain individuals indirectly protects others. We develop a general age-stratified non-Markovian epidemic model that captures memory dynamics and accommodates diverse epidemic models within one framework via state aggregation. Building on this, we map non-Markovian final states to an equivalent Markovian representation, enabling real-time fast direct prediction of long-term epidemic outcomes under vaccination. Leveraging this mapping, we design a dynamic prioritization strategy that continually allocates doses to minimize the predicted long-term final epidemic burden, explicitly balancing indirect transmission blocking with the direct protection of important groups and outperforming static policies and those short-term heuristics that target only immediate direct effects. We further uncover the underlying mechanism that drives shifts in vaccine prioritization as the epidemic progresses and coverage accumulates, underscoring the importance of adaptive allocations. This study renders long-term prediction tractable in systems with memory and provides actionable guidance for optimal vaccine deployment.</description>

      <title>Photodiode quantum efficiency for 2-{\mu}m light in the signal band of gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies with quantum correlated light require photodiodes with near-perfect `true' quantum efficiency, the definition of which adequately accounts for the photodiode dark noise. Future squeezed-light-enhanced gravitational wave detectors could in principle achieve higher sensitivities with a longer laser wavelength around 2 {\mu}m. Photodiodes made of extended InGaAs are available for this range, but the true quantum efficiency at room temperature and the low frequency band of gravitational waves is strongly reduced by dark noise. Here we characterize the change in performance of a commercial extended-InGaAs photodiode versus temperature. While the dark noise decreases as expected with decreasing temperature, the detection efficiency unfortunately also decreases monotonically. Our results indicate the need for a dedicated new design of photodiodes for gravitational wave detectors using 2-{\mu}m laser light.</description>

      <title>On the thermodynamic analogy of intracellular diffusivity fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two recent topics on a formal thermodynamic analogy of intracellular diffusivity fluctuations observed experimentally in normal/anomalous diffusion are reported. Not only the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also that of the Clausius inequality are identified. Then, the analog of the heat engine is constructed to characterize extraction of the diffusivity change as the analog of work during a cycle, the efficiency of which is formally equivalent to that of the Carnot engine, making the total change of the entropy concerning the fluctuations vanish. The effect of the slow variation of the fluctuations on the efficiency is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Lipid Phase Behavior and Protein Oligomerization in a Lattice Model of Raft Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membrane proteins often form dimers and higher-order oligomers whose stability and spatial organization depend sensitively on their lipid environment. To investigate the physical principles underlying this coupling, we employ a lattice Monte Carlo model of ternary lipid mixtures that exhibit liquid-disordered ($L_d$) and liquid-ordered ($L_o$) phase coexistence. In this framework, proteins are represented as small membrane inclusions with tunable nearest neighbor interactions with both lipids and other proteins, allowing us to examine how protein-lipid affinity competes with protein-protein interactions and lipid-lipid demixing. We find that the balance of these interactions controls whether proteins remain dispersed, assemble into small oligomers, or form large stable clusters within $L_o$ domains, and that increasing the protein concentration further promotes coarsening of the ordered phase. To incorporate ligand-regulated activation, we extend the model to a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme in which proteins stochastically switch between inactive and active states with distinct affinities. The inverse switching rate, relative to the time required for a protein to diffuse across the characteristic size of the $L_o$ domains, governs the aggregation behavior. Rapid switching yields only transient small oligomers, slow switching reproduces the static limit with persistent large clusters, and intermediate rates produce broad cluster-size distributions. These results highlight the interplay between lipid phase organization, protein-lipid affinity, and activation dynamics in regulating membrane protein oligomerization, a coupling that is central to signal transduction and membrane organization in living cells.</description>

      <title>Why Extensile and Contractile Tissues Could be Hard to Tell Apart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active nematic models explain the topological defects and flow patterns observed in epithelial tissues, but the nature of active stress-whether it is extensile or contractile, a key parameter of the theory-is not well established experimentally. Individual cells are contractile, yet tissue-level behavior often resembles extensile nematics. To address this discrepancy, we use a continuum theory with two-tensor order parameters that distinguishes cell shape from active stress. We show that correlating cell shape and flow, whether in coherent flows in channels, near topological defects, or at rigid boundaries, cannot unambiguously determine the type of active stress. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous measurements of stress and cell shape are essential to fully interpret experiments investigating the nature of the physical forces acting within epithelial cell layers.</description>

      <title>What do the fundamental constants of physics tell us about life?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.</description>

      <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Differential Dynamic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems. In its most common implementation, DDM analyzes image sequences acquired with a conventional microscope equipped with a digital camera, yielding time- and wavevector-resolved information analogous to that obtained in multi-angle Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</description>
