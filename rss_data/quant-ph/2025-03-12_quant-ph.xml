      <title>Quantum systems of atoms with highly singular interaction potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum statistical systems, composed of atoms or molecules interacting with each other through highly singular non-integrable potentials, are considered. The treatment of such systems cannot start with the standard approximations such as Hartree, Hartree-Fock or Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov approximations because of non-integrability of the interaction potentials leading to divergences. It is shown that the iterative procedure for Green functions can be rearranged so that the starting approximation takes into account regularizing atomic correlations. Then all the following approximation orders contain only the regularized interaction potential producing no divergences. The method of constructing the regularizing correlation function is suggested, based on the solution of the scattering equation in the form of asymptotic series at short distance, which can be extrapolated to arbitrary spatial variables by means of self-similar approximation theory. Regularizing correlation functions for several kinds of atomic systems are exemplified.</description>

      <title>A Note on Clifford Stabilizer Codes for Ising Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a streamlined elaboration on existing ideas that link Ising anyon (or equivalently, Majorana) stabilizer codes to certain classes of binary classical codes. The groundwork for such Majorana-based quantum codes can be found in earlier works (including, for example, Bravyi (arXiv:1004.3791) and Vijay et al. (arXiv:1703.00459)), where it was observed that commuting families of fermionic (Clifford) operators can can often be systematically lifted from weakly self-dual or self-orthogonal binary codes. Here, we recast and unify these ideas into a classification theorem that explicitly shows how explicitly shows how q-isotropic subspaces in $\mathbb{F}_2^{2n}$ yield commuting Clifford operators relevant to Ising anyons, and how these subspaces naturally correspond to punctured self-orthogonal codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^{2n+1}$.</description>

      <title>QUIET-SR: Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Single Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) using deep learning have significantly improved image restoration quality. However, the high computational cost of processing high-resolution images due to the large number of parameters in classical models, along with the scalability challenges of quantum algorithms for image processing, remains a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We evaluate our framework in MNIST (30.24 PSNR, 0.989 SSIM), FashionMNIST (29.76 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM) and the MedMNIST dataset collection, demonstrating that QUIET-SR achieves PSNR and SSIM scores comparable to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. These findings highlight the potential of scalable variational quantum machine learning models for SISR, marking a step toward practical quantum-enhanced image super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the optical pumping process in Nitrogen-Vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical pumping process is a fundamental tool for quantum protocols using the electronic and nuclear spins in the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers platform. In this work, we explore the process of electronic spin polarization through optical pumping from a thermodynamic perspective. We identify the sources of work and heat and show that the heat current is direct related to the experimentally accessible fluorescence of the NV center. We also show that the polarization of the electronic spin depends on the amount of work that is provided to the system by the laser pump. Moreover, we study the von Neumann entropy change in the process. We demonstrate that the entropy can be separated into two contributions: one due to the heat produced and the other due to the work provided, which is a consequence of the non-unitary nature of the pumping process. Finally, we show that increasing the power of the laser results in the increasing of the entropy of the final state, which hinders the polarization efficiency.</description>

      <title>Robust Simulations of Many-Body Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase Transitions on a Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology and symmetry play critical roles in characterizing quantum phases of matter. Recent advancements have unveiled symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in many-body systems as a unique class of short-range entangled states, notable for their nontrivial edge modes and characteristic ground-state entanglement gap. In this study, we demonstrate the robust simulation of many-body ground states of an Ising-cluster model on a quantum computer. By employing the method of quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) combined with enhanced zero-noise extrapolation techniques, we achieve accurate measurements of the transition between trivial and cluster SPT phases. Furthermore, we measured the characteristic edge modes and their associated topological entanglement properties, such as the second R\'enyi entropy, reduced density matrix, and entanglement spectral gap. Our work demonstrates the potential of using QITE in investigating sophisticated quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Einstein's 1927 gedanken experiment: how to complete it and measure the collapse time of a spatially spread photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the famous Solvay 1927 conference, Einstein discussed a gedanken experiment involving a single photon diffracted at an aperture and impinging on a screen. He devised the example to support De Broglie's hypothesis of the pilot wave, and his own ideas on the incompleteness of the description of physical reality provided by Quantum Mechanics. Partial realizations of Einstein's example have been performed, but the complete experiment has not been attempted (for good practical reasons) yet. Here I describe how to do it with accessible means. The setup will make possible to test Hellwig and Kraus postulate of covariant reduction of the quantum state.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Knots and Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes review a description of quantum mechanics in terms of the topology of spaces, basing on the axioms of Topological Quantum Field Theory and path integral formalism. In this description quantum states and operators are encoded by the topology of spaces that are used as modules to build the quantum mechanical model, while expectation values and probabilities are given by topological invariants of spaces, knots and links. The notes focus on the specific way the topology encodes quantum mechanical features, or, equivalently, on how these features can be controlled through the topology. A topological classification of entanglement is discussed, as well as properties of entanglement entropy and basic quantum protocols. The primary aim is to build a less conventional diagrammatic intuition about quantum mechanics, expanding the paradigm of ``Quantum Picturalism".</description>

      <title>Quantum Averaging for High-Fidelity Quantum Logic Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices implementation allow us to study their application to real-life computational problems. However, hardware challenges are not the only ones that hinder our quantum computation capabilities. Software limitations are the other, less explored side of this medal. Using satellite image segmentation as a task example, we investigated how difficult it is to run a hybrid quantum-classical model on a real, publicly available quantum device. We also analyzed the costs of such endeavor and the change in quality of model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generalization of symmetric quantum joint measurements on multiple qubits. We first describe a method for constructing a symmetric joint measurement basis for three qubits by utilizing single-qubit states corresponding to the four vertices of a tetrahedron on the Bloch sphere. We demonstrate the expected tetrahedral symmetry of the current measurement basis and discuss its application in a trilocal star-shaped network. This architecture enables us to generalize the two-qubit symmetric joint measurement to an $n$-qubit version, preserving the tetrahedral or hexahedral symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information of a Four-Level Tripod-Type Atom in Motion Interacting with a Deformed Binomial Field in the Presence of a Non-Linear Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interaction dynamics of a four-level tripod-type atomic system coupled to a q-deformed binomial field state within a Kerr-medium. The interaction model incorporates time-dependent coupling parameter and detuning parameter, providing a more adaptable framework for describing atom-field interactions. Special focus is placed on examining how the q-deformation, time-dependent coupling parameter, detuning parameter and Kerr nonlinearity affect the system's fidelity properties and linear entropy dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the effects of the considered parameters have a significant impact on atom-field entanglement and fidelity. These findings offer valuable insights into controlled quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum information processing and nonlinear quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Fundamental work costs of preparation and erasure in the presence of quantum side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thought experiment of Maxwell's demon highlights the effect of side information in thermodynamics. In this paper, we present an axiomatic treatment of a quantum Maxwell's demon, by introducing a resource-theoretic framework of quantum thermodynamics in the presence of quantum side information. Under minimal operational assumptions that capture the demon's behaviour, we derive the one-shot work costs of preparing, as well as erasing, a thermodynamic system whose coupling with the demon's mind is described by a bipartite quantum state. With trivial Hamiltonians, these work costs are precisely captured by the smoothed conditional min- and max-entropies, respectively, thus providing operational interpretations for these one-shot information-theoretic quantities in microscopic thermodynamics. An immediate, information-theoretic implication of our results is an affirmative proof of the conjectured maximality of the conditional max-entropy among all axiomatically plausible conditional entropies, complementing the recently established minimality of the conditional min-entropy. We then generalize our main results to the setting with nontrivial Hamiltonians, wherein the work costs of preparation and erasure are captured by a generalized type of mutual information. Finally, we present a macroscopic second law of thermodynamics in the presence of quantum side information, in terms of a conditional version of the Helmholtz free energy. Our results extend the conceptual connection between thermodynamics and quantum information theory by refining the axiomatic common ground between the two theories and revealing fundamental insights of each theory in light of the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric frequency converters (PFCs) play a critical role in bridging the frequency gap between quantum information carriers. PFCs in the microwave band are particularly important for superconducting quantum processors, but their operating bandwidth is often strongly limited. Here, we present a multimode kinetic metastructure for parametric frequency conversion between broadly spanning frequency modes. This device comprises a chain of asymmetric kinetic inductance grids designed to deliver efficient three-wave mixing nonlinearity. We demonstrate high efficient coherent conversion among broadly distributed modes, and the mode frequency is continuously tunable by controlling the external magnetic field strength, making it ideally suited for quantum computing and communication applications requiring flexible and efficient frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Optimal sensing on an asymmetric exceptional surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connection between exceptional points (EPs) and optimal parameter estimation, in a simple system consisting of two counter-propagating traveling wave modes in a microring resonator. The unknown parameter to be estimated is the strength of a perturbing cross-coupling between the two modes. Partially reflecting the output of one mode into the other creates a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which exhibits a family of EPs, creating an exceptional surface (ES). We use a fully quantum treatment of field inputs and noise sources to obtain a quantitative bound on the estimation error by calculating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the output fields, whose inverse gives the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the mean-squared-error of any unbiased estimator. We determine the bounds for two input states, namely, a semiclassical coherent state and a highly nonclassical NOON state. We find that the QFI is enhanced in the presence of an EP for both of these input states and that both states can saturate the Cram\'er-Rao bound. We then identify idealized yet experimentally feasible measurements that achieve the minimum bound for these two input states. We also investigate how the QFI changes for parameter values that do not lie on the ES, finding that these can have a larger QFI, suggesting alternative routes to optimize the parameter estimation for this problem.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Two-Qubit Grover Algorithm in MBQC with Universal Blind Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of quantum computing technology has led to the emergence of early-stage quantum cloud computing services. To fully realize the potential of quantum cloud computing, it is essential to develop techniques that ensure the privacy of both data and functions. Quantum computations often leverage superposition to evaluate a function on all possible inputs simultaneously, making function privacy a critical requirement. In 2009, Broadbent et al. introduced the Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC) protocol, which is based on Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) and provides a framework for ensuring both function and data privacy in quantum computing. Although theoretical results indicate an equivalence between MBQC and circuitbased quantum computation, translating MBQC into circuitbased implementations remains challenging due to higher qubit requirements and the complexity of the transformation process. Consequently, current quantum cloud computing platforms are limited in their ability to simulate MBQC efficiently. This paper presents an efficient method to simulate MBQC on circuit-based quantum computing platforms. We validate this approach by implementing the two-qubit Grover algorithm in the MBQC framework and further demonstrate blindness by applying the UBQC protocol. This work verifies the simulation of a blind quantum computation using the two-qubit Grover algorithm on a circuit-based quantum computing platform.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Quantum Coherence via Schur-Horn Majorization: Degenerate Distillation and Refined Entropic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for quantifying quantum coherence in finite-dimensional systems by applying the Schur-Horn majorization theorem to relate eigenvalue distributions and diagonal entries of density matrices. Building on this foundation, we introduce a versatile suite of coherence measures, including the relative cross-entropy of coherence and its partial variants, that satisfy all resource theoretic axioms under incoherent operations. This unifying approach clarifies the geometric boundaries of physically realizable states in von Neumann-Tsallis entropy space and uncovers the phenomenon of degenerate coherence distillation where symmetry in the eigenvalue spectrum enables enhanced coherence extraction in higher-dimensional systems. In addition, we strengthen the entropy-based uncertainty relation by refining the Massen-Uffink bound to account for the largest eigenvalues across distinct measurement bases. This refinement forges a deeper connection between entropy and uncertainty, which yields operationally meaningful constraints for quantum information tasks. Altogether, our findings illustrate the power of majorization in resource-theoretic analyses of quantum coherence, which offer valuable tools for both fundamental research and real-world applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Training Hybrid Deep Quantum Neural Network for Reinforced Learning Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a new paradigm for computation, exploiting an exponentially growing Hilbert space for data representation and operation. Computing results are obtained from measurement based stochastic sampling over nontrivial distributions produced by the quantum computing process with complex correlations from quantum entanglement. Quantum machine learning (QML) emerged as a promising method, potentially surpassing classical counterparts in efficiency and accuracy. While large scale fault tolerant quantum (LSFTQ) machines are not yet available, recent works on hybrid quantum machine learning models, compatible with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers, have hinted at improved generalizability. Such hybrid deep quantum neural networks (hDQNNs) integrate GPU CPU based deep neural networks (DNNs) with forward parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) that can be straightforwardly executed on quantum processors. However, backpropagating through forward PQCs remains computationally inefficient if it is simulated on classical hardware, and current quantum hardware constraints impede batched backpropagation even with dedicated PQCs for calculating gradients of forward PQCs, limiting scalability for modern machine learning tasks. Here, we present a scalable quantum machine learning architecture that overcomes these challenges with efficient backpropagation, enabling scalable hDQNN training with PQCs on physical quantum computers or classical PQC simulators. Applied to reinforcement learning benchmarks, our method highlights that hDQNNs could exhibit potentially improved generalizability compared to purely classical models. These findings offer a pathway toward near term hybrid quantum classical computing systems for large scale machine learning and underscore the potential of hybrid quantum classical architectures in advancing artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Coherence Properties of Rare-Earth Spins in Micrometer-Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth ions in bulk crystals are excellent solid-state quantum systems in quantum information science, owing to the exceptional optical and spin coherence properties. However, the weak fluorescence of single rare-earth ions present a significant challenge for scalability, necessitating the integration into micro-cavities. Thin films serve as a promising material platform for the integration, yet the fabrication without compromising the properties of the materials and rare-earth ions remains challenging. In this work, we fabricate micrometer-thin yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) films from bulk crystals using ion implantation techniques. The resulting films preserve the single-crystalline structure of the original bulk crystal. Notably, the embedded rare-earth ions are photo-stable and exhibit bulk-like spin coherence properties. Our results demonstrate the compatibility of bulk-like spin properties with the thin-film fabrication technique, facilitating the efficient integration of rare-earth ions into on-chip photonic devices and advancing the applications of rare-earth ions systems in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Two-party entanglement distribution in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution is a fundamental property in quantum many-body physics, but the effect of long-range interactions on the distribution has not been fully understood. Here, we study long-range two-party entanglement (TPE) and explore its distribution properties in XXZ spin chains with the exponential and power-law long-range interactions(ELRIs and PLRIs). In the thermodynamic limit case with the ELRIs, the TPE quantified by two-qubit concurrence decays exponentially along with two-site distance and the long-range concurrences can indicate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. We present a fine-grained entanglement distribution relations among the entanglement truncation length, total concurrences and two-tangles in the infinite spin chains. Moreover, in the finite XXZ chain with the more common PLRIs, the TPE decays algebraically along with the two-spin distance, and the total concurrence can exhibit a piecewise function with respect to total two-tangles. These new presented TPE distribution relations can be regarded as the generalization of Koashi-Bu\v{z}ek-and-Imoto bound for the long-range quantum models, and have potential applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the uncertainty relation for the sum of variances, which is called in some papers, the stronger uncertainty relation for all incompatible observables. We show that this uncertainty relation for the sum of variances of the observables $A$ and $B$ calculated for the eigenstate of one of these observables, (say of $B$), contrary to the suggestions presented in some papers, leads to the same results as the Heisenberg--Robertson uncertainty relation, that it does not give any bounds on the variance of $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems can be prepared in an infinite continuum of states, but only some of them can be used as resources for quantum technologies. Discerning whether a specific quantum state falls into this class, is often a challenging task. We show that it can be performed by looking at the squeezing of the quantum states - a scenario in which the variance of some observable operator is suppressed below the threshold given by the non-useful states. We discuss the general concept first; then we illustrate the approach by evaluating cubic nonlinear squeezing in the system of collective atomic spins.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine Coupling Constants on Quantum Computers: Performance, Errors, and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first implementation and computation of electron spin resonance isotropic hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) on quantum hardware. As illustrative test cases, we compute the HFCs for the hydroxyl radical (OH$^{\bullet}$), nitric oxide (NO$^{\bullet}$), and the triplet hydroxyl cation (OH$^{+}$). Our approach integrates the qubit-ADAPT method with unrestricted orbital optimization in an active space framework. To accurately measure the necessary spin one-electron reduced density matrices on current hardware, we employ a combination of error mitigation, error suppression, and post-selection, including our in-house developed ansatz-based readout and gate error mitigation. The HFCs obtained from the quantum hardware experiments align with results from unrestricted complete active space self-consistent field calculations on classical hardware. These results mark a significant step towards leveraging quantum computing for chemically relevant molecular properties and highlight the critical role of multi-method error strategies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Single-Qudit Quantum Neural Networks for Multiclass Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a single-qudit quantum neural network for multiclass classification, by using the enhanced representational capacity of high-dimensional qudit states. Our design employs an $d$-dimensional unitary operator, where $d$ corresponds to the number of classes, constructed using the Cayley transform of a skew-symmetric matrix, to efficiently encode and process class information. This architecture enables a direct mapping between class labels and quantum measurement outcomes, reducing circuit depth and computational overhead. To optimize network parameters, we introduce a hybrid training approach that combines an extended activation function -- derived from a truncated multivariable Taylor series expansion -- with support vector machine optimization for weight determination. We evaluate our model on the MNIST and EMNIST datasets, demonstrating competitive accuracy while maintaining a compact single-qudit quantum circuit. Our findings highlight the potential of qudit-based QNNs as scalable alternatives to classical deep learning models, particularly for multiclass classification. However, practical implementation remains constrained by current quantum hardware limitations. This research advances quantum machine learning by demonstrating the feasibility of higher-dimensional quantum systems for efficient learning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanics with semi-transparent membrane multi-oscillators in a high-finesse cavity is an established solution for designing the dispersive interaction, and reaching many achievements, such as the study of non-linear dynamics, heat transfer, and so on. The multi-oscillators are dielectric slabs, usually with low reflectivity, constituting an etalon. Here we propose the theoretical and experimental investigation of a low-finesse optical cavity formed by two (nominally identical) parallel semi-transparent membranes. The experiment consists in laser-driving the cavity, detecting interferometrically the field reflected by the etalon, and measuring the intensity of the transmitted field, for different distances within the two membranes. A complete characterization of the membrane sandwich is provided. On the other hand, we developed an analytical model to describe the fields, which reproduces all the experimental results, under specific approximations. As expected, the model reproduces the known results when high-reflectivity, and/or fixed mirrors conditions are restored. This work paves the way for a complete and analytical model to describe multi-oscillators "membrane-in-the-middle" optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Eigen-SNAP gate for photonic qubits in a cavity-transmon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale FPGA-Based Privacy Amplification Exceeding $10^8$ Bits for Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy Amplification (PA) is indispensable in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) post-processing, as it eliminates information leakage to eavesdroppers. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are highly attractive for QKD systems due to their flexibility and high integration. However, due to limited resources, input and output sizes remain the primary bottleneck in FPGA-based PA schemes for Discrete Variable (DV)-QKD systems. In this paper, we present a large-scale FPGA-based PA scheme that supports both input block sizes and output key sizes exceeding $10^8$ bits, effectively addressing the challenges posed by the finite-size effect. To accommodate the large input and output sizes, we propose a novel PA algorithm and prove its security. We implement and evaluate this scheme on a Xilinx XCKU095 FPGA platform. Experimental results demonstrate that our PA implementation can handle an input block size of $10^8$ bits with flexible output sizes up to the input size. For DV-QKD systems, our PA scheme supports an input block size nearly two orders of magnitude larger than current FPGA-based PA schemes, significantly mitigating the impact of the finite-size effect on the final secure key rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time evolution of the one-point probability distribution of stochastic processes and quantum processes for $N$-level systems has been unified. Hence, quantum states and quantum operations can be regarded as generalizations of the one-point probability vectors and stochastic matrices, respectively. It has also been proven that completely positive divisibility (CP-divisibility) for quantum operations is the natural extension of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. It is thus shown that CP-divisibility is a necessary but insufficient condition for a quantum process to be specified as Markovian. The main results have been illustrated through a dichotomic Markov process.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach for implementing pulse-efficient SU(4) gates on cross resonance (CR)-based superconducting quantum devices. Our method introduces a parameterized unitary derived from the CR-Hamiltonian propagator, which accounts for static-$ZZ$ interactions. Leveraging the Weyl chamber's geometric structure, we successfully realize a continuous 2-qubit basis gate, $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$, as an echo-free pulse schedule on the IBM Quantum device ibm_kawasaki. We evaluate the average fidelity and gate time of various SU(4) gates generated using the $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ to confirm the advantages of our implementation.</description>

      <title>Grand Unification of All Discrete Wigner Functions on $d \times d$ Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a universal framework for defining, visualising, and transforming between all possible $d\times d$ discrete Wigner functions for a single $d$-dimensional qudit. This framework constructs valid functions by cross-correlating a naturally emerging $2d\times 2d$ discrete Wigner function with an information-reorganising function called a stencil. Validity criteria for the Wigner function translate into stencil conditions, ensuring consistency. Additionally, we identify one stencil that is valid for all even dimensions (and which coincides with Wootters' function for $d=2$) and another valid for all odd dimensions, reproducing Gross' function (as well as Wootters' for odd prime dimensions). Furthermore, we establish invertible linear transformations between all valid functions within the same dimension, enabling a systematic comparison of their structural and operational properties, such as negativity and marginalisation.</description>

      <title>Optimal elemental configuration search in crystal using quantum approximate optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal elemental configuration search in crystal is a crucial task to discovering industrially important materials such as lithium-ion battery cathodes. In this paper we present application of quantum approximate optimization algorithm, the representative near-term quantum algorithm for combinatorial optimization, to finding the most stable elemental configuration in a crystal, using Au-Cu alloys as an example. After expressing the energy of the crystal in the form of the Ising model through the cluster expansion method combined with first-principles calculations, we numerically perform QAOA with three types of parameter optimization. As a result, we have demonstrated that the optimal solution can be sampled with a high probability for crystals containing up to 32 atoms. Our results could pave the way for optimal elemental configuration search in a crystal using a near-term quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Comparing quantum complexity and quantum fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of obtaining a given state starting from a typically unentangled state. In this work, we show that complexity, when defined through the minimization of a Riemannian cost functional over the manifold of Gaussian states, provides the same information as quantum fidelity and is therefore capable of detecting quantum phase transitions. However, it does not offer a more refined analysis than entanglement entropy for a given state. We conclude that incorporating a notion of spatial locality into the computation of complexity is essential to uncover new physics beyond what is accessible through entanglement entropy and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum algorithm for divergence estimation and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of quantum information technology, designing efficient distributed quantum algorithms to perform various information processing tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we consider a distributed scenario where two parties, Alice and Bob, given access to matrices $A$ and $B$ respectively, aim to estimate ${\rm Tr}(f(A)g(B))$, where $f$ and $g$ are known functions. In this task, only local quantum operations, classical communication and single-qubit measurements are allowed due to the high cost of quantum communication and entangled measurements. We propose a distributed quantum algorithm framework to compute ${\rm Tr}(f(A)g(B))$ within an additive error $\varepsilon$. The proposed algorithm framework requires $\widetilde{O}\left(d^2 / (\delta \varepsilon^2)\right)$ quantum queries and two-qubit gates, assuming that the minimum singular value of each matrix $A, B \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ is at least $\delta$. Additionally, our algorithm framework uses a simple Hadamard test architecture, enabling easier quantum hardware implementation. This algorithm framework allows for various applications including quantum divergence estimation, distributed solving of linear system, and distributed Hamiltonian simulation, while preserving the privacy of both parties. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\max\left\{1 /\varepsilon^2, \sqrt{dr}/\varepsilon\right\}\right)$ on the query complexity for the task, where $r$ denotes the rank of the input matrices. We believe this framework holds broad applicability across a range of distributed quantum computing tasks.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and purity can help to detect systematic experimental errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements are central in all quantitative sciences and a fundamental challenge is to make observations without systematic measurement errors. This holds in particular for quantum information processing, where other error sources like noise and decoherence are unavoidable. Consequently, methods for detecting systematic errors have been developed, but the required quantum state properties are yet unexplored. We develop theoretically a direct and efficient method to detect systematic errors in quantum experiments and demonstrate it experimentally using quantum state tomography of photon pairs emitted from a semiconductor quantum dot. Our results show that entanglement as well as quantum states with a high purity can help to identify systematic errors.</description>

      <title>No quantum advantage without classical communication: fundamental limitations of quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks connect systems at separate locations via quantum links, enabling a wide range of quantum information tasks between distant parties. Large-scale networks have the potential to enable global secure communication, distributed quantum computation, enhanced clock synchronization, and high-precision multiparameter metrology. For the optimal development of these technologies, however, it is essential to identify the necessary resources and sub-routines that will lead to the quantum advantage, but this is demanding even for the simplest protocols in quantum information processing. Here we show that quantum networks relying on the long-distance distribution of bipartite entanglement, combined with local operations and shared randomness, cannot achieve a relevant quantum advantage. Specifically, we prove that these networks do not help in preparing resourceful quantum states such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states or cluster states, despite the free availability of long-distance entanglement. At an abstract level, our work points towards a fundamental difference between bipartite and multipartite entanglement. From a practical perspective, our results highlight the need for classical communication combined with quantum memories to fully harness the power of quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks with bipartite resources and shared randomness present the simplest infrastructure for implementing a future quantum internet. Here, we shall investigate which kinds of entanglement can or cannot be generated from this kind of quantum network by examining their fidelity with different graph states. On the one hand, based on a standard form of graph states under local complementation and a fine-grained uncertainty relation between two projections, we establish upper bounds of fidelity that improve over previous results by at least $25\%$ as the dimension of local systems tends to infinity. On the other hand, in the triangle network, we propose efficient protocols to generate genuine multipartite entangled states from the network, providing significant nontrivial lower bounds of fidelity with high dimensional GHZ states.</description>

      <title>Frequency-noise-insensitive universal control of Kerr-cat qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the influence of frequency uncertainties on the operation of a Kerr-cat qubit. As the mean photon number increases, Kerr-cat qubits provide an increasing level of protection against phase errors induced by unknown frequency shifts during idling and X rotations. However, realizing rotations about the other principal axes (e.g., Y and Z axes) while preserving robustness is nontrivial. To address this challenge, we propose a universal set of gate schemes which circumvents the tradeoff between protection and controllability in Kerr-cat qubits and retains robustness to unknown frequency shifts to at least first order. Assuming an effective Kerr oscillator model, we theoretically and numerically analyze the robustness of elementary gates on Kerr-cat qubits, with special focus on gates along nontrivial rotation axes. An appealing application of this qubit design would include tunable superconducting platforms, where the induced protection against frequency noise would allow for a more flexible choice of operating point and thus the potential mitigation of the impact of spurious two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Contextuality sans incompatibility in the simplest scenario: Communication supremacy of a qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom asserts that measurement incompatibility is necessary for revealing the non-locality and contextuality. In contrast, a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 230201 (2023)] demonstrates the generalized contextuality without measurement incompatibility by using a five-outcome qubit measurement. In this paper, we introduce a two-party prepare-measure communication game involving specific constraints on preparations, and we demonstrate contextuality sans incompatibility in the simplest measurement scenario, requiring only a three-outcome qubit measurement. This is in contrast to the aforementioned five-outcome qubit measurement, which can be simulated by an appropriate convex mixture of five three-outcome incompatible qubit measurements. Furthermore, we illustrate that our result has a prominent implication in information theory. Our communication game can be perceived as a constrained Holevo scenario, as operational restrictions are imposed on preparations. We show that the maximum success probability of the game by using a qubit surpasses that attainable by a c-bit, even when shared randomness is a free resource. Consequently, this finding exemplifies the supremacy of a qubit over a c-bit within a constrained Holevo framework. Thus, alongside offering fresh insights into quantum foundations, our results pave a novel pathway for exploring the efficacy of a qubit in information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum position verification in one shot: parallel repetition of the $f$-BB84 and $f$-routing protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum position verification (QPV) aims to verify an untrusted prover's location by timing communication with them. To reduce uncertainty, it is desirable for this verification to occur in a single round. However, previous protocols achieving one-round secure QPV had critical drawbacks: attackers pre-sharing an EPR pair per qubit could perfectly break them, and their security depended on quantum information traveling at the speed of light in vacuum, a major experimental challenge in quantum networks. In this work, we prove that a single round of interaction suffices for secure position verification while overcoming these limitations. We show that security for a one-round protocol can rely only on the size of the classical information rather than quantum resources, making implementation more feasible, even with a qubit error tolerance of up to 3.6%, which is experimentally achievable with current technology -- and showing that the timing constraints have to apply only to classical communication. In short, we establish parallel repetition of the $f$-BB84 and $f$-routing QPV protocols. As a consequence of our techniques, we also demonstrate an order-of-magnitude improvement in the error tolerance for the sequential repetition version of these protocols, compared to the previous bounds of Nature Physics 18, 623-626 (2022).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout multiple cooldowns we observe a power-law reduction in time for the rate of multi-qubit correlated poisoning events, while the rate of shifts in qubit offset-charge remains constant; evidence of a non-ionizing source of pair-breaking phonon bursts for superconducting qubits. We investigate different types of sample packaging, some of which are sensitive to mechanical impacts from the cryocooler pulse tube. One possible source of these events comes from relaxation of thermally-induced stresses from differential thermal contraction between the device layer and substrate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states from their multi-mode counting statistics. We introduce the idea that measuring high-order correlations of particle numbers can reveal entanglement without making any assumptions about the coherence of the fields. In particular, we show that the two- and four-body number correlations are sufficient to fully characterize the entanglement of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states for which each mode exhibits a thermal distribution. In addition, we derive an entanglement witness based on two-body correlations alone. Our findings are of great importance because it becomes possible to reveal entanglement in a series of recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Linear-Time Quantum Annealing for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing are two of the most popular quantum optimization heuristics. While QAOA is known to be able to approximate quantum annealing, the approximation requires QAOA angles to vanish with the problem size $n$, whereas optimized QAOA angles are observed to be size-independent for small $n$ and constant in the infinite-size limit. This fact led to a folklore belief that QAOA has a mechanism that is fundamentally different from quantum annealing. In this work, we provide evidence against this by analytically showing that QAOA energy approximates that of quantum annealing under two conditions, namely that angles vary smoothly from one layer to the next and that the sum is bounded by a constant. These conditions are known to hold for near-optimal QAOA angles empirically. Our results are enabled by novel formulae for QAOA energy with constant sum of angles and arbitrary depth and the series expansion of energy in sum of angles, which we obtain using the saddle-point method, which may be of independent interest. While our results are limited to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, we show numerically that the expansion holds for random 2SAT and expect our main results to generalize to other constraint satisfaction problems. A corollary of our results is a quadratic improvement for the bound on depth required to compile Trotterized quantum annealing of the SK model.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo approach for finding optimally controlled quantum gates with differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unitary evolution in time may be treated as a curve in the manifold of the special unitary group. The length of such a curve can be related to the energetic cost of the associated computation, meaning a geodesic curve identifies an energetically optimal path. In this work, we employ sub-Riemannian geometry on the manifold of the unitary group to obtain optimally designed Hamiltonians for generating single-qubit gates in an environment with the presence of dephasing noise as well as a two-qubit gate under a time-constant crosstalk interaction. The resulting geodesic equation involves knowing the initial conditions of the parameters that cannot be obtained analytically. We then introduce a random sampling method combined with a minimization function and a cost function to find initial conditions that lead to optimal control fields. We also compare the optimized control fields obtained from the solutions of the geodesic equation with those extracted from the well-known Krotov method. Both approaches provide high fidelity values for the desired quantum gate implementation, but the geodesic method has the advantage of minimizing the required energy to execute the same task. These findings bring new insights for the design of more efficient fields in the arsenal of optimal control theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that special and general theories of relativity implicitly assume spacetime events correspond to quantum measurement outcomes. This leads to a change in how one should view the equivalence of spacetime and gravity. We describe a Bell test using time-like measurements that indicates a non classical causal structure that does not violate no-signaling. From this perspective, the violation of the Bell inequalities are already evidence for the non classical structure of flat spacetime as seen by an agent embedded in it. We argue that spacetime geometry can be learned by an embedded agent with internal actuators and sensors making internal measurements.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the avian compass function described by radical pair model against biomagnetic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic sensing mechanism proposed to exist in avian eyes functions as a compass that detects the geomagnetic inclination aiding their migration. This mechanism is modeled by a quantum spin model known as the radical pair (RP) model. This model suggests that information about geomagnetic inclination is transmitted as biochemical signals via spin-selective recombination of the RP. However, as a delicate quantum system in a warm and noisy in vivo environment, the RP model is likely to be subject to unavoidable environmental noise. In this study, we develop a model that incorporates environmental magnetic noise, based on a Lindblad-type master equation. Our model includes the type of biological tissue and the temperature of the biological system as parameters, accounting for their effects. The results of numerical calculations indicate that the compass function of the RP model is robust against intrinsic magnetic noise arising from thermal fluctuations in the electromagnetic field within realistic biomagnetic range. However, noise from an environmental magnetic field far exceeding the biological magnetic range, on the order of hundreds to thousands of $\mu$T, significantly affects and disrupts the compass function. This work provides a foundation for quantifying environmental influences on open quantum systems in biological settings and offers a tool for connecting experimental measurements of environmental magnetic fields with quantum noise modeling.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the holographic prescription for computing the refined R\'enyi entropies $\tilde S_n$ in the $n \to 0$ limit in the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_{d}$ context. This can be interpreted as a high temperature limit with respect to the notion of energy provided by the modular Hamiltonian describing the state of the system reduced to a subregion. We find, to the leading order in $n$, that the system attains local equilibrium and admits a CFT description in terms of an Euclidean irrotational perfect fluid. The fluid has vortex like boundary conditions at the boundary of the region. These vortices extends into the bulk in the form of a conical singularity, in agreement with Dong's proposal for the holographic dual to the R\'enyi entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state phonon and charge detectors probe the scattering of weakly interacting particles, such as dark matter and neutrinos, through their low recoil thresholds. Recent advancements have pushed sensitivity to eV-scale energy depositions, uncovering previously-unseen low-energy excess backgrounds. While some arise from known processes such as thermal radiation, luminescence, and stress, others remain unexplained. This review examines these backgrounds, their possible origins, and parallels to low-energy effects in solids. Their understanding is essential for interpreting particle interactions at and below the eV-scale.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories in varying dimensions, lattice volumes, and truncations offer a rich family of targets for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum devices. In return, formulating quantum simulations can provide new ways of thinking about the quantum structure of gauge theories. In this work, we consider pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory in two and three spatial dimensions in a streamlined version of the electric basis. We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for NISQ era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multi-controlled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Interferometric single-shot parity measurement in InAs-Al hybrid devices", Microsoft Quantum, Nature 638, 651-655 (2025)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the 'parity readout' of a (topological) superconductor claimed in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025). A prerequisite for this claim is the existence of a superconducting gap in the nanowire device. However, to determine the presence of a gap, Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) relied on the so-called topological gap protocol (TGP). Here, we show that the TGP can report the regions where the 'parity readout' occurred as either gapped or gapless, depending on data parameters such as magnetic field range and cutter pair (junction transparency). Compounding these issues are inaccuracies in the presented TGP outcomes, which limited investigation of reproducibility. Since these inconsistent outcomes demonstrate that the TGP is not a reliable diagnostic tool for the presence of a superconducting gap, we instead investigate the conductance data for the studied regions -- data that were not presented in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), but are in the public data repository. These conductance data show that the regions where 'parity readout' occurred are in fact highly disordered and present no clear gap in the nanowire, i.e., the underlying conductance data show that these regions are indeed gapless. That these regions are gapless contradicts the claim that the reported measurements are of the parity of a superconducting nanowire, let alone the parity of a topological superconducting nanowire. Taken together, these issues mean that the core findings in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) are not reliable and should be revisited.</description>

      <title>Stark-modulated Rydberg dissipative time crystals at room-temperature applied to sub-kHz electric-field sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium Rydberg gases exhibit emergent many-body phases due to mode competition. Sustained limit cycle oscillations (OSC) emerge when driven by B-fields at room-temperature, forming robust Rydberg dissipative time crystals (DTC). These driven-dissipative Rydberg DTC have recently been shown to develop an effective transition centered at the OSC frequency (-10dB bandwidth of ~1.7kHz, centered at 9.8kHz). Weak RF signals injected within this emergent transition perturb and emerge on the OSC spectrum, from which sensitive and high-resolution sensing of E-fields (~1.6-2.3 uVcm-1Hz-1/2) near the OSC frequencies can be achieved. In this article, it is demonstrated that DC and AC Stark fields in the sub-kHz regime can be used effectively to shift (DC) or modulate (AC) the OSC frequency of Rydberg DTC at room-temperature. The AC-Stark driven modulation of the OSC is shown as an effective technique to sense weak AC E-fields in the sub-kHz regime. With a modest setup, a sensitivity of ~7.8 uVcm-1Hz-1/2 for AC signals at 300Hz (~8.7x improvement over state-of-art Rydberg atom techniques), and high-resolution detection to as low as sub-Hz is demonstrated. This approach enables the development of ultra-compact, extremely low-frequency E-field detectors for applications in remote sensing, communications, navigation, and bio-medical technologies.</description>

      <title>Detuning-symmetric laser cooling of many mechanical modes with a photothermally modified cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Cybersecurity Education: A Novel Curriculum for Enhancing Graduate STEM Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm with the potential to transform numerous application areas by addressing problems considered intractable in the classical domain. However, its integration into cyberspace introduces significant security and privacy challenges. The exponential rise in cyber attacks, further complicated by quantum capabilities, poses serious risks to financial systems and national security. The scope of quantum threats extends beyond traditional software, operating system, and network vulnerabilities, necessitating a shift in cybersecurity education. Traditional cybersecurity education, often reliant on didactic methods, lacks hands on, student centered learning experiences necessary to prepare students for these evolving challenges. There is an urgent need for curricula that address both classical and quantum security threats through experiential learning. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of EE 597: Introduction to Hardware Security, a graduate level course integrating hands-on quantum security learning with classical security concepts through simulations and cloud-based quantum hardware. Unlike conventional courses focused on quantum threats to cryptographic systems, EE 597 explores security challenges specific to quantum computing itself. We employ a mixed-methods evaluation using pre and post surveys to assess student learning outcomes and engagement. Results indicate significant improvements in students' understanding of quantum and hardware security, with strong positive feedback on course structure and remote instruction (mean scores: 3.33 to 3.83 on a 4 point scale).</description>

      <title>Electro-mechanically tunable, waveguide-coupled photonic-crystal cavities with embedded quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip micro-cavities with embedded quantum emitters provide an excellent platform for high-performance quantum technologies. A major difficulty for such devices is overcoming the detrimental effects of fluctuations in the device dimensions caused by the limitations of the fabrication processes. We present a fully tunable system based on a 1D photonic-crystal cavity with an embedded quantum dot, which enables tuning of both the quantum dot emission energy and the cavity mode wavelength. A micro-electromechanical cantilever is used to tune the cavity mode wavelength via index modulation and the quantum-confined Stark effect is used to tune the quantum dot emission energy, mitigating the effect of fabrication imperfections. To demonstrate the operation of the device, a maximum, voltage-controllable cavity tuning range of $\Delta \lambda = 1.8$ nm is observed. This signal is measured at the end of a bus waveguide which side-couples to the cavity, enabling the coupling of multiple cavities to a common waveguide, a key requirement for scale-up in these systems. Additionally, a quantum dot is tuned into resonance with the cavity mode, exhibiting an enhanced emission rate with a resolution limited Purcell factor of $F_P = 3.5$.</description>

      <title>Materials Discovery With Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials discovery is a computationally intensive process that requires exploring vast chemical spaces to identify promising candidates with desirable properties. In this work, we propose using quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms following the extremal learning framework to predict novel heteroacene structures with low hole reorganization energy $\lambda$, a key property for organic semiconductors. We leverage chemical data generated in a previous large-scale virtual screening to construct three initial training datasets containing 54, 99 and 119 molecules encoded using $N=7,16$ and 22 bits, respectively. Furthermore, a sequential learning process is employed to augment the initial training data with compounds predicted by the algorithms through iterative retraining. Both algorithms are able to successfully extrapolate to heteroacene structures with lower $\lambda$ than in the initial dataset, demonstrating good generalization capabilities even when the amount of initial data is limited. We observe an improvement in the quality of the predicted compounds as the number of encoding bits $N$ increases, which offers an exciting prospect for applying the algorithms to richer chemical spaces that require larger values of $N$ and hence, in perspective, larger quantum circuits to deploy the proposed quantum-enhanced protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the long-time behavior of Local Operator Entanglement entropy (LOE) in finite-size interacting integrable systems. For certain operators in the Rule 54 automaton, we prove that the LOE saturates to a value that is at most logarithmic in system size. The logarithmic bound relies on a feature of Rule 54 that does not generalize to other interacting integrable systems: namely, that there are only two types of quasiparticles, and therefore only two possible values of the phase shift between quasiparticles. We present a heuristic argument, supported by numerical evidence, that for generic interacting integrable systems (such as the Heisenberg spin chain) the saturated value of the LOE is volume-law in system size.</description>

      <title>Universal Properties of Critical Mixed States from Measurement and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the universal properties of mixed quantum matter obtained from "single-shot" adaptive evolution, in which a quantum-critical ground-state is manipulated through a single round of local measurements and local unitary operations conditioned on spatially-distant measurement outcomes. The resulting mixed quantum states are characterized by altered long-distance correlations between local observables, mixed-state entropy, and entanglement negativity. By invoking a coarse-grained, continuum description of single-shot adaptation in (1+1) dimensions, we find that the extensive mixed-state entropy exhibits a sub-leading, constant correction ($\gamma$), while the entanglement negativity can grow logarithmically with sub-region size, with a coefficient ($\alpha$); both constants can attain universal values which are distinct from the expected behavior in any quantum-critical ground-state. We investigate these properties in single-shot adaptation on ($i$) the critical point between a one-dimensional $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and a symmetry-broken state, and ($ii$) a spinful Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. In the former case, adaptive evolution that decoheres one sublattice of the SPT can yield a critical mixed-state in which $\alpha$ attains a universal value, which is half of that in the original state. In the latter case, we show how adaptation -- involving feedback on the spin degrees of freedom, after measuring the local charge -- modifies long-distance correlations, and determine via an exact replica field-theoretic calculation that $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ vary continuously with the strength of feedback. Numerical studies confirm these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bell theorem is explored in terms of a trade-off relation between underlying assumptions within the hidden variable model framework. In this paper, recognizing the incorporation of hidden variables as one of the fundamental assumptions, we propose a measure termed `hidden information' taking account of their distribution. This measure quantifies the number of hidden variables that essentially contribute to the empirical statistics. For factorizable models, hidden variable models that satisfy `locality' without adhering to the measurement independence criterion, we derive novel relaxed Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequalities. These inequalities elucidate trade-off relations between measurement dependence and hidden information in the CHSH scenario. It is also revealed that the relation gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the measures to be realized by a factorizable model.</description>

Abstract: Space-based quantum technologies are essential building blocks for global quantum networks. However, the optoelectronic components used can be susceptible to radiation damage. Predicting long-term instrument performance in the presence of radiation remains a challenging part of space missions. We present a model that accounts for differences in radiation shielding and can predict the trends for dark count rates of space-based silicon Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (GM-APD). We find that the predicted trends are correlated with in-situ observations from GM-APDs on-board the SpooQy-1 CubeSat mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By utilizing quantum mechanical effects, such as superposition and entanglement, quantum metrology promises higher precision than the classical strategies. It is, however, practically challenging to realize the quantum advantages. This is mainly due to the difficulties in engineering non-classical probe state and performing nontrivial measurement in practise, particularly with a large number of particles. Here we propose a scalable scheme with a symmetrical variational quantum circuit which, same as the Loschmidt echo, consists of a forward and a backward evolution. We show that in this scheme the quantum Fisher information, which quantifies the precision limit, can be efficiently obtained from a measurement signal of the Loschmidt echo. We experimentally implement the scheme on an ensemble of 10-spin quantum processor and successfully achieves a precision near the theoretical limit which outperforms the standard quantum limit with 12.4 dB. The scheme can be efficiently implemented on various noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices which provides a promising routine to demonstrate quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Quantum Feasibility Labeling for NP-complete Vertex Coloring Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many important science and engineering problems can be converted into NP-complete problems which are of significant importance in computer science and mathematics. Currently, neither existing classical nor quantum algorithms can solve these problems in polynomial time. To address this difficulty, this paper proposes a quantum feasibility labeling (QFL) algorithm to label all possible solutions to the vertex coloring problem, which is a well-known NP-complete problem. The QFL algorithm converts the vertex coloring problem into the problem of searching an unstructured database where good and bad elements are labeled. The recently proposed variational quantum search (VQS) algorithm was demonstrated to achieve an exponential speedup, in circuit depth, up to 26 qubits in finding good element(s) from an unstructured database. Using the labels and the associated possible solutions as input, the VQS can find all feasible solutions to the vertex coloring problem. The number of qubits and the circuit depth required by the QFL each is a polynomial function of the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the number of colors of a vertex coloring problem.

      <title>Quantifying total correlations in quantum systems through the Pearson correlation coefficient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventionally the total correlations within a quantum system are quantified through distance-based expressions such as the relative entropy or the square-norm. Those expressions imply that a quantum state can contain both classical and quantum correlations. In this work, we provide an alternative method to quantify the total correlations through the Pearson correlation coefficient. Using this method, we argue that a quantum state can be correlated in either a classical or a quantum way, i.e., the two cases are mutually exclusive. We also illustrate that, at least for the case of two-qubit systems, the distribution of the correlations among certain locally incompatible pairs of observables provides insight in regards to whether a system contains classical or quantum correlations. Finally, we show how correlations in quantum systems are connected to the general entropic uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Data-driven decoding of quantum error correcting codes using graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To leverage the full potential of quantum error-correcting stabilizer codes it is crucial to have an efficient and accurate decoder. Accurate, maximum likelihood, decoders are computationally very expensive whereas decoders based on more efficient algorithms give sub-optimal performance. In addition, the accuracy will depend on the quality of models and estimates of error rates for idling qubits, gates, measurements, and resets, and will typically assume symmetric error channels. In this work, instead, we explore a model-free, data-driven, approach to decoding, using a graph neural network (GNN). The decoding problem is formulated as a graph classification task in which a set of stabilizer measurements is mapped to an annotated detector graph for which the neural network predicts the most likely logical error class. We show that the GNN-based decoder can outperform a matching decoder for circuit level noise on the surface code given only simulated experimental data, even if the matching decoder is given full information of the underlying error model. Although training is computationally demanding, inference is fast and scales approximately linearly with the space-time volume of the code. We also find that we can use large, but more limited, datasets of real experimental data [Google Quantum AI, Nature {\bf 614}, 676 (2023)] for the repetition code, giving decoding accuracies that are on par with minimum weight perfect matching. The results show that a purely data-driven approach to decoding may be a viable future option for practical quantum error correction, which is competitive in terms of speed, accuracy, and versatility.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-Oriented Qubit Mapping for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms implemented on near-term devices require qubit mapping due to noise and limited qubit connectivity. In this paper we propose a strategy called algorithm-oriented qubit mapping (AOQMAP) that aims to bridge the gap between exact and scalable mapping methods by utilizing the inherent structure of algorithms. While exact methods provide optimal solutions, they become intractable for large circuits. Scalable methods, like SWAP networks, offer fast solutions but lack optimality. AOQMAP bridges this gap by leveraging algorithmic features and their association with specific device substructures to achieve depth-optimal and scalable solutions. The proposed strategy follows a two stage approach. First, it maps circuits to subtopologies to meet connectivity constraints. Second, it identifies the optimal qubits for execution using a cost function and performs postselection among execution results across subtopologies. Notably, AOQMAP provides both scalable and optimal solutions for variational quantum algorithms with fully connected two qubit interactions on common subtopologies including linear, T-, and H-shaped, minimizing circuit depth. Benchmarking experiments conducted on IBM quantum devices demonstrate significant reductions in gate count and circuit depth compared to Qiskit, Tket, and SWAP network. Specifically, AOQMAP achieves up to an 82% reduction in circuit depth and an average 138% increase in success probability. This scalable and algorithm-specific approach holds the potential to optimize a wider range of quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Stabilizer circuits arise in almost every area of quantum computation and communication, so there is interest in studying them from an information-theoretic perspective, i.e. as quantum channels. We consider several natural approaches to what can be called a Clifford channel: the channel that can be realised by a stabilizer circuit without classical control, the channel that sends pure stabilizer states to mixed stabilizer states, the channel with stabilizer Choi state, the channel whose Stinespring dilation can have a Clifford unitary. We show the equivalence of these definitions. Up to unitary encoding and decoding maps any Clifford channel is a product of stabilizer state preparations, qubit discardings, identity channels and full dephasing channels. This simple structure allows to compute information capacities of such channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport provides a powerful mathematical framework with applications spanning numerous fields. A cornerstone within this domain is the $p$-Wasserstein distance, which serves to quantify the cost of transporting one probability measure to another. While recent attempts have sought to extend this measure to the realm of quantum states, existing definitions often present certain limitations, such as not being faithful. In this work, we present a new definition of quantum Wasserstein distances. This definition, leveraging the coupling method and a metric applicable to pure states, draws inspiration from a property characterising the classical Wasserstein distance - its determination based on its value on point masses. Subject to certain continuity properties, our definition exhibits numerous attributes expected of an optimal quantum rendition of the Wasserstein distance. Notably, our approach seamlessly integrates metrics familiar to quantum information theory, such as the trace distance. Moreover, it provides an organic extension for metrics, like Nielsen's complexity metric, allowing their application to mixed states with a natural operational interpretation. Furthermore, we analyze this metric's attributes in the context of random quantum states and unveil phase transitions concerning the complexity of subsystems of random states.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum computation using quantum annealing with the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computation is a promising emerging technology, and by utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics, it is expected to achieve faster computations than classical computers for specific problems. There are two distinct architectures for quantum computation: gate-based quantum computers and quantum annealing. In gate-based quantum computation, we implement a sequence of quantum gates that manipulate qubits. This approach allows us to perform universal quantum computation, yet they pose significant experimental challenges for large-scale integration. On the other hand, with quantum annealing, the solution of the optimization problem can be obtained by preparing the ground state. Conventional quantum annealing devices with transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, such as those manufactured by D-Wave Inc., achieving around 5000 qubits, are relatively more amenable to large-scale integration but are limited to specific computations. In this paper, we present a practical method for implementing universal quantum computation within the conventional quantum annealing architecture using the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian. Our innovative approach relies on an adiabatic transformation of the Hamiltonian, changing from transverse fields to a ferromagnetic interaction regime, where the ground states become degenerate. Notably, our proposal is compatible with D-Wave devices, opening up possibilities for realizing large-scale gate-based quantum computers. This research bridges the gap between conventional quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computation, offering a promising path toward the development of scalable quantum computing platforms.</description>

Abstract: The search for global minima is a critical challenge across multiple fields including engineering, finance, and artificial intelligence, particularly with non-convex functions that feature multiple local optima, complicating optimization efforts. We introduce the Quantum Global Minimum Finder (QGMF), an innovative quantum computing approach that efficiently identifies global minima. QGMF combines binary search techniques to shift the objective function to a suitable position and then employs Variational Quantum Search to precisely locate the global minimum within this targeted subspace. Designed with a low-depth circuit architecture, QGMF is optimized for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, utilizing the logarithmic benefits of binary search to enhance scalability and efficiency. This work demonstrates the impact of QGMF in advancing the capabilities of quantum computing to overcome complex non-convex optimization challenges effectively.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Quantum Search Algorithm for Solving Traveling Salesman Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum search algorithms, such as Grover's algorithm, are anticipated to efficiently solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However, applying these algorithms to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) on a quantum circuit presents a significant challenge. Existing quantum search algorithms for the TSP typically assume that an initial state -- an equal superposition of all feasible solutions satisfying the problem's constraints -- is pre-prepared. The query complexity of preparing this state using brute-force methods scales exponentially with the factorial growth of feasible solutions, creating a significant hurdle in designing quantum circuits for large-scale TSPs. To address this issue, we propose a two-step quantum search (TSQS) algorithm that employs two sets of operators. In the first step, all the feasible solutions are amplified into their equal superposition state. In the second step, the optimal solution state is amplified from this superposition state. The TSQS algorithm demonstrates greater efficiency compared to conventional search algorithms that employ a single oracle operator for finding a solution within the encoded space. Encoded in the higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HOBO) representation, our approach significantly reduces the qubit requirements. This enables efficient initial state preparation through a unified circuit design, offering a quadratic speedup in solving the TSP without prior knowledge of feasible solutions.</description>

      <title>Exact Correlation Functions for Dual-Unitary Quantum circuits with exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-unitary quantum circuits can provide analytic spatiotemporal correlation functions of local operators from transfer matrices, enriching our understanding of quantum dynamics with exact solutions. Nevertheless, a full understanding is still lacking as the case of a non-diagonalizable transfer matrix with exceptional points has less been investigated. In this paper, we give an inverse approach for constructing dual-unitary quantum circuits with exceptional points in the transfer matrices, by establishing relations between transfer matrices and local unitary gates. As a consequence of the coalesce of eigenvectors, the correlation functions exhibit a polynomial modified exponential decay, which is significantly different from pure exponential decay, especially at early stages. Moreover, we point out that the Hamiltonian evolution of a kicked XXZ spin chain can be approximately mapped to a dual-unitary circuit with exceptional points by Trotter decomposition. Finally, we investigate the dynamics approaching and at exceptional points, showing that behaviors of correlation functions are distinct by Laplace transformation.</description>

      <title>Solving Caldeira-Leggett Model by Inchworm Method with Frozen Gaussian Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm that combines the inchworm method and the frozen Gaussian approximation to simulate the Caldeira-Leggett model in which a quantum particle is coupled with thermal harmonic baths. In particular, we are interested in the real-time dynamics of the reduced density operator. In our algorithm, we use frozen Gaussian approximation to approximate the wave function as a wave packet in integral form. The desired reduced density operator is then written as a Dyson series, which is the series expression of path integrals in quantum mechanics of interacting systems. To compute the Dyson series, we further approximate each term in the series using Gaussian wave packets, and then employ the idea of the inchworm method to accelerate the convergence of the series. The inchworm method formulates the series as an integro-differential equation of ``full propagators'', and rewrites the infinite series on the right-hand side using these full propagators, so that the number of terms in the sum can be significantly reduced, and faster convergence can be achieved. The performance of our algorithm is verified numerically by various experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose schemes capable of measuring an arbitrary set of commutative logical Pauli operators in time independent of the number of operators. The only condition is commutativity, a fundamental requirement for simultaneous measurements in quantum mechanics. Quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes show great promise for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing. They are particularly significant for early fault-tolerant technologies as they can encode many logical qubits using relatively few physical qubits. By achieving simultaneous measurements of logical operators, our approaches enable fully parallelized quantum computing, thus minimizing computation time. Our schemes are applicable to any qLDPC codes and maintain the low density of parity checks while measuring multiple logical operators simultaneously. These results enhance the feasibility of applying early fault-tolerant technologies to practical problems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computation of the energy of molecules and materials is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. Practical applications require development of quantum algorithms with reduced resource requirements. Previous work has mainly focused on quantum algorithms where the Hamiltonian is represented in second quantization with compact basis sets while existing methods in first quantization are limited to a grid-based basis. In this work, we present a new method to solve the generic ground-state chemistry problem in first quantization using any basis set. We achieve asymptotic speedup in Toffoli count for molecular orbitals, and orders of magnitude improvement using dual plane waves as compared to the second quantization counterparts. In some instances, our approach provides similar or even lower resources compared to previous first quantization plane wave algorithms that, unlike our approach, avoids the loading of the classical data. The developed methodology can be applied to variety of applications, where the matrix elements of a first quantized Hamiltonian lack simple circuit representation.</description>

Abstract: The decomposition of a square matrix into a sum of Pauli strings is a classical pre-processing step required to realize many quantum algorithms. Such a decomposition requires significant computational resources for large matrices. We present an exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string coefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More specifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the decomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a multiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition coefficients in $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ time and using $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional memory, for an $N\times N$ matrix. A numerical implementation of our equation outperforms currently available solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether quantum computers can achieve exponential speedups in optimization has been a major open question in quantum algorithms since the field began. Here we introduce a quantum algorithm called Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), which uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce optimization problems to decoding problems. For approximating optimal polynomial fits to data over finite fields, DQI efficiently achieves a better approximation ratio than any polynomial time classical algorithm known to us, thus suggesting exponential quantum speedup. We also extend this to multivariate polynomials. These optimization problems are solved approximately by quantum reduction to decoding of Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes, respectively. Sparse unstructured optimization problems such as max-k-XORSAT are reduced to decoding of LDPC codes. Although we have not identified quantum advantage for the sparse unstructured case, we prove a theorem which allows the performance of DQI to be calculated instance-by-instance based on the empirical performance of classical LDPC decoders such as belief propagation. We demonstrate this by benchmarking on an instance with over 30,000 variables.</description>

      <title>Statistical Virtual Temperature of Classical and Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a foundational definition of statistical virtual temperature, derived from the spectrum of the Gibbs Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state and formulated using d-1 indices of purity (IP), where d represents the Hilbert space dimension within the C*-algebra framework. We demonstrate that the universal physical bounds between von Neumann entropy and statistical virtual temperature are constrained by these IPs, which may offer broader applications to quantum systems. Additionally, we geometrize classical optical polarization states of an arbitrary electromagnetic field and provide an interpretation of the quantum Mpemba effect, where a quantum system prepared at a higher statistical virtual temperature relaxes to equilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. This behavior is explained through a novel concept of temperature-resolved entanglement asymmetry. Additionally, we present a geometric interpretation of the third law of thermodynamics using these entropy-temperature diagrams. Nevertheless, the defined statistical virtual temperature inherently exhibits the third law of thermodynamics. We believe that this work has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of classical polarization theory, quantum information theory, and quantum thermodynamics, and it may establish new connections and insights into these fields.</description>

      <title>Variational Graphical Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, most typical quantum error-correcting codes are designed for generic noise models, which may fail to accurately capture the intricate noise characteristics of real quantum devices, limiting their practical performance. This work introduces a learning-based framework for the constructing of quantum error-correcting codes, termed Variational Graphical Quantum Error Correction (VGQEC) codes, which adapts to specific noise profiles of different quantum devices, enabling the design of noise-tailored codes. Specifically, inspired by Quon, a graphical language for quantum information, VGQEC codes incorporate tunable parameters embedded within their Quon graphs, allowing dynamic reconfigurations of the graph structures through parameter adjustments. As the first application of this approach, we show that this flexibility in code designs facilitates seamless transitions between various code families, exemplified by the establishment of a bridge between the five-qubit repetition code and the [[5,1,3]] code, thereby combining their respective advantages. Additionally, a VGQEC code derived from the three-qubit repetition code is fine-tuned for the amplitude damping noise, showcasing the approach's ability for noise-specific code design. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the three-qubit VGQEC code in the low-to-medium noise regime with a photonic system, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage and lower bounds in parallel query complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that quantum, randomized and deterministic (sequential) query complexities are polynomially related for total boolean functions. We find that significantly larger separations between the parallel generalizations of these measures are possible. In particular,
  (1) We employ the cheatsheet framework to obtain an unbounded parallel quantum query advantage over its randomized analogue for a total function, falsifying a conjecture of Jeffery et al. 2017 (arXiv:1309.6116).
  (2) We strengthen (1) by constructing a total function which exhibits an unbounded parallel quantum query advantage despite having no sequential advantage, suggesting that genuine quantum advantage could occur entirely due to parallelism.
  (3) We construct a total function that exhibits a polynomial separation between 2-round quantum and randomized query complexities, contrasting a result of Montanaro in 2010 (arXiv:1001.0018) that there is at most a constant separation for 1-round (nonadaptive) algorithms.
  (4) We develop a new technique for deriving parallel quantum lower bounds from sequential upper bounds. We employ this technique to give lower bounds for Boolean symmetric functions and read-once formulas, ruling out large parallel query advantages for them.
  We also provide separations between randomized and deterministic parallel query complexities analogous to items (1)-(3).</description>

      <title>Model validation and error attribution for a drifting qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit performance is often reported in terms of a variety of single-value metrics, each providing a facet of the underlying noise mechanism limiting performance. However, the value of these metrics may drift over long time-scales, and reporting a single number for qubit performance fails to account for the low-frequency noise processes that give rise to this drift. In this work, we demonstrate how we can use the distribution of these values to validate or invalidate candidate noise models. We focus on the case of randomized benchmarking (RB), where typically a single error rate is reported but this error rate can drift over time when multiple passes of RB are performed. We show that using a statistical test as simple as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on the distribution of RB error rates can be used to rule out noise models, assuming the experiment is performed over a long enough time interval to capture relevant low frequency noise. With confidence in a noise model, we show how care must be exercised when performing error attribution using the distribution of drifting RB error rate.</description>

Abstract: Leveraging the techniques found in the literature on Quantum Equilibration for finite dimensional systems, we develop the theory of Quantum Equilibration for the case of infinite-dimensional systems, particularly the cases where the dynamics-generating Hamiltonians have continuous spectrum. The main goal of this paper will be to propose a framework to extend the results obtained by Short in, where estimates for the equilibration-on-average and effective equilibration for the case of Hamiltonians with continuous spectrum are derived. We will show that in the latter setting, it is compulsory to constrain ourselves to finite time equilibration; we then develop estimates analogous to the main results in the proposed setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and universality in stationary state of long-range Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the signature of quantum criticality in the long-time stationary state of the long-range Kitaev chain by performing various quench protocols. In this model, the pairing interaction decays with distance according to a power law with exponent $\alpha$. Using quantum information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and logarithmic negativity, we show that, irrespective of the values of $\alpha$, critical-to-critical quench displays quantum criticality even in the stationary state. Remarkably, in the presence of long-range pairing interactions, where fermionic correlators decay algebraically even at non-critical points, signature of quantum criticality persists in the stationary state. Furthermore, the effective central charge, calculated from both mutual information and logarithmic negativity of stationary state following a critical-to-critical quench, agrees with the central charge of the corresponding ground states for both $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 2$. Therefore, information of the universality class can be inferred from the stationary state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics introduces the possibility for particles to move in a direction opposite to their momentum -- a counter-intuitive and classically impossible phenomenon known as quantum backflow. The magnitude of this effect is relatively small, making its experimental observation, which has yet to be achieved, particularly challenging. Here, we investigate the influence of quantum statistics on the maximal backflow attainable for two identical particles confined to a ring. Notably, we demonstrate that the fermionic statistics significantly impedes quantum backflow compared to the bosonic statistics. Our findings suggest that any future experimental realization of quantum backflow should prioritize systems involving bosons rather than fermions.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Interference of Photons from Remote Tin-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths. These results highlight the potential of tin-vacancy centres in diamond for establishing robust optical links between remote quantum registers.</description>

      <title>Exponentially accurate open quantum simulation via randomized dissipation with minimal ancilla</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is an essential technique for understanding complex physical phenomena and advancing quantum technologies. Some quantum algorithms for simulating Lindblad dynamics achieve logarithmically short circuit depth in terms of accuracy $\varepsilon$ by coherently encoding all possible jump processes with a large ancilla consumption. Minimizing the space complexity while achieving such a logarithmic depth remains an important challenge. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating general Lindblad dynamics with multiple jump operators aimed at an observable estimation, that achieves both a logarithmically short circuit depth and a minimum ancilla size. Toward simulating an exponentially accurate Taylor expansion of the Lindblad propagator to ensure the circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, we develop a novel random circuit compilation method that leverages dissipative processes with only a single jump operator; importantly, the proposed method requires the minimal-size, $4 + \lceil \log M \rceil$, ancilla qubits where each single jump operator has at most $M$ Pauli strings. Furthermore, the gate complexity depends on neither the number of terms in Hamiltonian nor the number of jump operators, owing to the random compilation. This work represents a significant step towards making open quantum system simulations more feasible on early fault-tolerant quantum computing devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to review developments regarding the use of ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators. Special emphasis is placed on relativistic quantum phenomena, which are presumably most interesting for the audience of this journal. After a brief introduction into the main idea of quantum simulators and the basic physics of ultra-cold atoms, relativistic quantum phenomena of linear fields are discussed, including Hawking radiation, the Unruh effect, cosmological particle creation, the Gibbons-Hawking and Ginzburg effects, super-radiance, Sauter-Schwinger and Breit-Wheeler pair creation, as well as the dynamical Casimir effect. After that, the focus is shifted to phenomena of non-linear fields, such as the sine-Gordon model, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, false-vacuum decay, and quantum back-reaction. In order to place everything into proper context, the basic underlying mechanisms of these phenomena are briefly recapitulated before their simulators are discussed. Even though effort is made to provide a review as fair as possible, there can be co claim of completeness and the selection as well as the relative weights of the topics may well reflect the personal view and taste of the author.</description>

      <title>QuSplit: Achieving Both High Fidelity and Throughput via Job Splitting on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the progression into the quantum utility era, computing is shifting toward quantum-centric architectures, where multiple quantum processors collaborate with classical computing resources. Platforms such as IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket exemplify this trend, enabling access to diverse quantum backends. However, efficient resource management remains a challenge, as quantum processors are highly susceptible to noise, which significantly impacts computation fidelity. Additionally, the heterogeneous noise characteristics across different processors add further complexity to scheduling and resource allocation. Existing scheduling strategies typically focus on mapping and scheduling jobs to these heterogeneous backends, which leads to some jobs suffering extremely low fidelity. Targeting quantum optimization jobs (e.g., VQC, VQE, QAOA) - among the most promising quantum applications in the NISQ era - we hypothesize that executing the later stages of a job on a high-fidelity quantum processor can significantly improve overall fidelity. To verify this, we use VQE as a case study and develop a Genetic Algorithm-based scheduling framework that incorporates job splitting to optimize fidelity and throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently maintains high fidelity across all jobs while significantly enhancing system throughput. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits excellent scalability in handling an increasing number of quantum processors and larger workloads, making it a robust and practical solution for emerging quantum computing platforms. To further substantiate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on a real quantum processor, IBM Strasbourg, which confirm that job splitting improves fidelity and reduces the number of iterations required for convergence.</description>

      <title>The Q-Spellbook: Crafting Surface Code Layouts and Magic State Protocols for Large-Scale Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is a cornerstone of reliable quantum computing, with surface codes emerging as a prominent method for protecting quantum information. Surface codes are efficient for Clifford gates but require magic state distillation protocols to process non-Clifford gates, such as T gates, essential for universal quantum computation. In large-scale quantum architectures capable of correcting arbitrary circuits, specialized surface codes for data qubits and distinct codes for magic state distillation are needed. These architectures can be organized into data blocks and distillation blocks. The system works by having distillation blocks produce magic states and data blocks consume them, causing stalls due to either a shortage or excess of magic states. This bottleneck presents an opportunity to optimize quantum space by balancing data and distillation blocks. While prior research offers insights into selecting distillation protocols and estimating qubit requirements, it lacks a tailored optimization approach. We present a framework for optimizing large-scale quantum architectures, focusing on data block layouts and magic state distillation protocols. We evaluate three data block layouts and four distillation protocols under three optimization strategies: minimizing tiles, minimizing steps, and achieving a balanced trade-off. Through a comparative analysis of brute force, dynamic programming, greedy, and random algorithms, we find that brute force delivers optimal results, while greedy deviates by 7% for minimizing steps and dynamic programming matches brute force in tile minimization. We observe that total steps increase with columns, while total tiles scale with qubits. Finally, we propose a heuristic to help users select algorithms suited to their objectives, enabling scalable and efficient quantum architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems which fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.</description>

Abstract: Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the current work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding BBGKY hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the ZNE method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE we obtain an average reduction of the error by 18.2% and 52.8% for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.</description>

      <title>The Art of Optimizing T-Depth for Quantum Error Correction in Large-Scale Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC), combined with magic state distillation, ensures fault tolerance in large-scale quantum computation. To apply QEC, a circuit must first be transformed into a non-Clifford (or T) gate set. T-depth, the number of sequential T-gate layers, determines the magic state cost, impacting both spatial and temporal overhead. Minimizing T-depth is crucial for optimizing resource efficiency in fault-tolerant quantum computing. While QEC scalability has been widely studied, T-depth reduction remains an overlooked challenge. We establish that T-depth reduction is an NP-hard problem and systematically evaluate multiple approximation techniques: greedy, divide-and-conquer, Lookahead-based brute force, and graph-based. The Lookahead-based brute-force algorithm (partition size 4) performs best, optimizing 90\% of reducible cases (i.e., circuits where at least one algorithm achieved optimization) with an average T-depth reduction of around 51\%. Additionally, we introduce an expansion factor-based identity gate insertion strategy, leveraging controlled redundancy to achieve deeper reductions in circuits initially classified as non-reducible. With this approach, we successfully convert up to 25\% of non-reducible circuits into reducible ones, while achieving an additional average reduction of up to 11.8\%. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different expansion factor values and explore how varying the partition size in the Lookahead-based brute-force algorithm influences the quality of T-depth reduction.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational method to automatically design the n-qubit realisations of quantum algorithms. Our approach leverages a domain-specific language (DSL) that enables the construction of quantum circuits via modular building blocks, making it well-suited for evolutionary search. In this DSL quantum circuits are abstracted beyond the usual gate-sequence description and scale automatically to any problem size. This enables us to learn the algorithm structure rather than a specific unitary implementation. We demonstrate our method by automatically designing three known quantum algorithms--the Quantum Fourier Transform, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Grover's search. Remarkably, we were able to learn the general implementation of each algorithm by considering examples of circuits containing at most 5-qubits. Our method proves robust, as it maintains performance across increasingly large search spaces. Convergence to the relevant algorithm is achieved with high probability and with moderate computational resources.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general approximate quantization rule $ \int_{L_{E}}^{R_{E}}k_0(x)$ $dx=(N+\frac{1}{2})\pi $ or $ \oint k_0(x)$ $dx=(2N+1)\pi $ (including both forward and backward processes) for the bound states in the potential well of the $n$th-order Schr\"{o}dinger equations $ e^{-i\pi n/2}{{}\frac{d^n\Psi(x)}{d x^n} } =[E-{} V(x)]\Psi(x) ,$ where ${} k_0(x)=(E-V(x) )^{1/n}$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}_{0} $, $n$ is an even natural number, and $L_{E}$ and $R_{E}$ the boundary points between the classically forbidden regions and the allowed region. The only hypothesis is that all exponentially growing components are negligible, which is appropriate for not narrow wells. Applications including the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum properties of black holes with a Floquet-driven optical lattice simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14058v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation and maximally fast scrambling. Here, we present a scheme for an analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes using ultracold atoms in a locally Floquet-driven optical lattice. We show how the effective dynamics of the driven system can generate position-dependent tunnelling amplitudes that encode the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of a (1+1)D simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements. Combined with the highly tunable onsite atom-atom interactions typical for cold atoms, our simulator provides a powerful and feasible platform to probe the scrambling of quantum information in black holes. We illustrate the ergodicity of our (2+1)D black-hole simulator by showing numerically that its level statistics in the hard-core limit approaches the ergodic regime faster than a globally homogeneous Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical formulation of the thermodynamics, free energy and entropy, of any generic Bogoliubov de Genes model which develops exceptional point (EP) bifurcations in its complex spectrum when coupled to reservoirs. We apply our formalism to a non-Hermitian Josephson junction where, despite recent claims, the supercurrent does not exhibit any divergences at EPs. The entropy, on the contrary, shows a universal jump of $1/2\log 2$ which can be linked to the emergence of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at EPs. Our method allows us to obtain precise analytical boundaries for the temperatures at which such Majorana entropy steps appear. We propose a generalized Maxwell relation linking supercurrents and entropy which could pave the way towards the direct experimental observation of such steps in e.g. quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) induced by quantum resetting of a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap. Our protocol consists of preparing initially the system in the ground state of a harmonic oscillator centered at $+a$, followed by a rapid quench where the center is shifted to $-a$ and the system is allowed to evolve unitarily up to a random Poissonian time $\tau$ distributed via $r\, e^{-r \tau}$. Then the trap center is reset to $+a$ again and the system is assumed to cool instantaneously to the initial ground state. The system is again allowed to evolve unitarily in the trap centered at $-a$ up to a random time, and the procedure is repeated. Under repeated resetting, the system reaches a NESS where the positions of bosons get strongly correlated due to simultaneous resetting induced by the trap. We fully characterize the steady state by analytically computing several physical observables such as the average density, extreme value statistics, order and gap statistics, and also the distribution of the number of particles in a region $[-L,L]$, known as the full counting statistics (FCS). In particular, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the scaling function describing the FCS exhibits a striking feature: it is supported over a nontrivial finite interval, and moreover is discontinuous at an interior point of the support. Our results are supported by numerical simulations. This is a rare example of a strongly correlated quantum many-body NESS where various observables can be exactly computed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt detector, coupled linearly to a massless scalar quantum field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, as a probe of the interior of a black hole. Specifically, we consider the transition rate of a detector in the spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole as it freely falls toward and across the horizon and compare it to the corresponding situation for an $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon. Both the BTZ black hole and its geon counterpart are quotients of $\text{AdS}_3$ spacetime that are identical exterior to the horizon but have different interior topologies. We find outside the horizon that the rates are qualitatively similar, but with the amplitude in the geon spacetime larger than in the BTZ case. Once the detector crosses the horizon, there are notable distinctions characterized by different discontinuities in the temporal derivative of the response rate. These discontinuities can appear outside the horizon if the detector is switched on at a sufficiently early time, within the past white hole horizon. In general, the detector can act as an `early warning system' that both spots the black hole horizon and discerns its interior topology.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>

      <title>Significant circular Unruh effect at small acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transition rates of an atom rotating in a circular orbit, which is coupled with fluctuating electromagnetic fields in vacuum. We find that when the rotational angular velocity exceeds the transition frequency of the atom, the excitation rate can reach the same order of magnitude as the emission rate, even with an extremely low centripetal acceleration resulting from a very small orbital radius. For experimentally accessible centripetal accelerations, the excitation rate of centripetally accelerated atoms can be $10^{272,878}$ times greater than that of linearly accelerated atoms with the same magnitude of acceleration. Our result suggests that the circular version of the Unruh effect can be significant even at very small centripetal accelerations, contrary to the common belief that a large Unruh effect requires large acceleration. This finding sheds new light on the experimental detection of the circular Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Bound-state formation and thermalization within the Lindblad approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation, as one approach to open quantum systems, describes the density matrix of a particle or a chain of interacting particles, which are in contact with a thermal bath. Still, it is not fully understood yet, how arbitrary systems evolve towards a stationary distribution, which guarantees thermalization in a thermodynamical context, and how to systematically incorporate the variety of assumptions that are made in this approach in order to preserve thermal Gibbs states. Despite these shortcomings, Lindblad dynamics was successfully employed in heavy-ion physics (quarkonia) and also became of interest in quantum-computer applications.
  In this paper, we consider a problem borrowed from heavy-ion collisions, namely the formation of bound states, as for example the deuteron, in the non-relativistic regime by using the already well understood techniques of Lindblad dynamics. However, only recently, we were able to extend this toolbox by showing, that the position-space Lindblad equation can be reformulated in terms of a diffusion-advection equation with sources and therefore provides a hydrodynamical formulation of a dissipative quantum master equation. Making use of this advanced machinery and insights, we describe the possible formation of a bound state, which is realized by a P\"oschl-Teller-like potential, of a particle in interaction with a heat bath in a 1-dim setting. We analyse the possibility of a thermalization and the time-scale of the formation, population and depopulation of the bound state. Finally, we also show an example of a much deeper potential, where we allow for three bound states, just in the spirit of quarkonia. Besides this, we discuss general aspects of open quantum systems, like decoherence, entropy production etc.</description>
