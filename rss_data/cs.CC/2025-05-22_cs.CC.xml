      <title>Decision DNNFs with imbalanced conjunction cannot efficiently represent CNFs of bounded width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decomposable Negation Normal Forms \textsc{dnnf} \cite{DarwicheJACM} is a landmark Knowledge Compilation (\textsc{kc}) model, highly important both in \textsc{ai} and Theoretical Computer Science. Numerous restrictions of the model have been studied. In this paper we consider the restriction where all the gates are $\alpha$-imbalanced that is, at most one input of each gate depends on more than $n^{\alpha}$ variables (where $n$ is the number if variables of the function being represented).
  The concept of imbalanced gates has been first considered in [Lai, Liu, Yin 'New canonical representations by augmenting OBDDs with conjunctive decomposition', JAIR, 2017]. We consider the idea in the context of representation of \textsc{cnf}s of bounded primal treewidth. We pose an open question as to whether \textsc{cnf}s of bounded primal treewidth can be represented as \textsc{fpt}-sized \textsc{dnnf} with $\alpha$-imbalanced gates.
  We answer the question negatively for Decision \textsc{dnnf} with $\alpha$-imbalanced conjunction gates. In particular, we establish a lower bound of $n^{\Omega((1-\alpha) \cdot k)}$ for the representation size (where $k$ is the primal treewidth of the input \textsc{cnf}). The main engine for the above lower bound is a combinatorial result that may be of an independent interest in the area of parameterized complexity as it introduces a novel concept of bidimensionality.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>

      <title>Capacitated Fair-Range Clustering: Hardness and Approximation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capacitated fair-range $k$-clustering generalizes classical $k$-clustering by incorporating both capacity constraints and demographic fairness. In this setting, each facility has a capacity limit and may belong to one or more demographic groups. The task is to select $k$ facilities as centers and assign each client to a center such that: ($a$) no center exceeds its capacity, ($b$) the number of centers selected from each group lies within specified lower and upper bounds (fair-range constraints), and ($c$) the clustering cost (e.g., $k$-median or $k$-means) is minimized.
  Prior work by Thejaswi et al. (KDD 2022) showed that satisfying fair-range constraints is NP-hard, making the problem inapproximable to any polynomial factor. We strengthen this result by showing that inapproximability persists even when the fair-range constraints are trivially satisfiable, highlighting the intrinsic computational complexity of the clustering task itself. Assuming standard complexity conjectures, we show that no non-trivial approximation is possible without exhaustively enumerating all $k$-subsets of the facility set. Notably, our inapproximability results hold even on tree metrics and when the number of groups is logarithmic in the size of the facility set.
  In light of these strong inapproximability results, we focus on a more practical setting where the number of groups is constant. In this regime, we design two approximation algorithms: ($i$) a polynomial-time $O(\log k)$- and $O(\log^2 k)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-median and $k$-means objectives, and ($ii$) a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by $k$, achieving $(3+\epsilon)$- and $(9 + \epsilon)$-approximation, respectively. These results match the best-known approximation guarantees for capacitated clustering without fair-range constraints and resolves an open question posed by Zang et al. (NeurIPS 2024).</description>

      <title>Maximum Separation of Quantum Communication Complexity With and Without Shared Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present relation problems whose input size is $n$ such that they can be solved with no communication for entanglement-assisted quantum communication models, but require $\Omega(n)$ qubit communication for $2$-way quantum communication models without prior shared entanglement. This is the maximum separation of quantum communication complexity with and without shared entanglement. To our knowledge, our result is the first lower bound on quantum communication complexity without shared entanglement when the upper bound of entanglement-assisted quantum communication models is zero. The problem we consider is a parallel repetition of any non-local game which has a perfect quantum strategy and no perfect classical strategy, and for which a parallel repetition theorem for the classical value holds with exponential decay.</description>

      <title>On the Keevash-Knox-Mycroft Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $1\le \ell &lt;k$ and $\delta\ge0$, let $\textbf{PM}(k,\ell,\delta)$ be the decision problem for the existence of perfect matchings in $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraphs with minimum $\ell$-degree at least $\delta\binom{n-\ell}{k-\ell}$. For $k\ge 3$, $\textbf{PM}(k,\ell,0)$ was one of the first NP-complete problems by Karp. Keevash, Knox and Mycroft conjectured that $\textbf{PM}(k, \ell, \delta)$ is in P for every $\delta &gt; 1-(1-1/k)^{k-\ell}$ and verified the case $\ell=k-1$.
  In this paper we show that this problem can be reduced to the study of the minimum $\ell$-degree condition forcing the existence of fractional perfect matchings. Together with existing results on fractional perfect matchings, this solves the conjecture of Keevash, Knox and Mycroft for $\ell\ge 0.4k$. Moreover, we also supply an algorithm that outputs a perfect matching, provided that one exists.</description>

      <title>Label propagation on binomial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03569v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of a label propagation algorithm (LPA) on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. Initially, given a network, each vertex starts with a random label in the interval $[0,1]$. Then, in each round of LPA, every vertex switches its label to the majority label in its neighborhood (including its own label). At the first round, ties are broken towards smaller labels, while at each of the next rounds, ties are broken uniformly at random. The algorithm terminates once all labels stay the same in two consecutive iterations. LPA is successfully used in practice for detecting communities in networks (corresponding to vertex sets with the same label after termination of the algorithm). Perhaps surprisingly, LPA's performance on dense random graphs is hard to analyze, and so far convergence to consensus was known only when $np\ge n^{3/4+\varepsilon}$, where LPA converges in three rounds. By defining an alternative label attribution procedure which converges to the label propagation algorithm after three rounds, a careful multi-stage exposure of the edges allows us to break the $n^{3/4+\varepsilon}$ barrier and show that, when $np \ge n^{5/8+\varepsilon}$, a.a.s.\ the algorithm terminates with a single label. Moreover, we show that, if $np\gg n^{2/3}$, a.a.s.\ this label is the smallest one, whereas if $n^{5/8+\varepsilon}\le np\ll n^{2/3}$, the surviving label is a.a.s.\ not the smallest one. En passant, we show a presumably new monotonicity lemma for Binomial random variables that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>What is a Sketch-and-Precondition Derivation for Low-Rank Approximation? Inverse Power Error or Inverse Power Estimation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized sketching accelerates large-scale numerical linear algebra by reducing computational complexity. While the traditional sketch-and-solve approach reduces the problem size directly through sketching, the sketch-and-precondition method leverages sketching to construct a computational friendly preconditioner. This preconditioner improves the convergence speed of iterative solvers applied to the original problem, maintaining accuracy in the full space. Furthermore, the convergence rate of the solver improves at least linearly with the sketch size. Despite its potential, developing a sketch-and-precondition framework for randomized algorithms in low-rank matrix approximation remains an open challenge. We introduce the Error-Powered Sketched Inverse Iteration (EPSI) Method via run sketched Newton iteration for the Lagrange form as a sketch-and-precondition variant for randomized low-rank approximation. Our method achieves theoretical guarantees, including a convergence rate that improves at least linearly with the sketch size.</description>
