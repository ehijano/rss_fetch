      <title>Amenability and skew-amenability of actions of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study notions of amenability and skew-amenability of continuous actions of topological groups on compact topological spaces. Our main motivation is the question under what conditions amenability of a topological group passes to a closed subgroup. Other applications include the understanding of the universal minimal flow of various non-amenable groups.</description>

      <title>Relative simplicity of the universal coverings of transformation groups and Tsuboi's metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many transformation groups on manifolds are simple, but their universal coverings are not. In the present paper, we study the concept of relatively simple group, that is, a group with the maximum proper normal subgroup. We show that many examples of universal coverings of transformation groups are relatively simple, including the universal covering $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$ of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.
  Tsuboi constructed a metric space $\mathcal{M}(G)$ for a simple group $G$. We generalize his construction to relatively simple groups, and study their large scale geometric structure. In particular, Tsuboi's metric space of $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M, \omega)$ is not quasi-isometric to the half line for every closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Transitive fusion systems over a class of finite p-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and $S$ a nonabelian finite $p$-group. In [9, 10], they proposed the following conjecture: if $\mathcal{F}$ be a transitive fusion system over a finite $p$-group $S$, then $S$ is either extraspecial of order $p^{3}$ or elementary abelian. In this note, we use an easy method to prove that this conjecture holds when the $p$-rank of $S$ is 2.</description>

Abstract: In the paper we study irreducible representations of some nilpotent groups of finite abelian total rank. The main result of the paper states that if a torsion-free minimax group $G$ of nilpotency class 2 admits a faithful irreducible representation $\varphi $ over a finitely generated field $k$ such that $chark \notin Sp(G)$ then there exist a subgroup $N$ and an irreducible primitive representation $\psi $ of the subgroup $N$ over $k$ such that the representation $\varphi $ is induced from $\psi $ and the quotient group $N/Ker\psi $ is finitely generated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a procedure for generating the irreducible representations of crystallography groups in any dimension. We also furnish a strategy to investigate the topology of the unitary dual of a crystallography group using sequences of matrices. All irreducible representations (up to unitary equivalence) of the dimension 3 crystallography group 90 and some calculations involving sequences of these irreducible representations are included as a proof of concept of this procedure and strategy.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence II. The classical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new approach to strong convergence of random matrices that is based primarily on soft arguments. This method was applied to achieve a refined qualitative and quantitative understanding of strong convergence of random permutation matrices and of more general representations of the symmetric group. In this paper, we introduce new ideas that make it possible to achieve stronger quantitative results and that facilitate the application of the method to new models.
  When applied to the Gaussian ensembles GUE/GOE/GSE of dimension $N$, these methods achieve strong convergence for noncommutative polynomials with matrix coefficients of dimension $\exp(o(N))$. This provides a sharp form of a result of Pisier on strong convergence with coefficients in a subexponential operator space. Analogous results up to logarithmic factors are obtained for Haar-distributed random matrices in $\mathrm{U}(N)/\mathrm{O}(N)/\mathrm{Sp}(N)$. We further illustrate the methods of this paper in three applications: we obtain improved rates for strong convergence of random permutation matrices; we obtain a quantitative form of strong convergence of the model introduced by Hayes for the solution of the Peterson-Thom conjecture; and we prove strong convergence of all nontrivial representations of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ of dimension up to $\exp(N^{1/3-\delta})$, improving a recent result of Magee and de la Salle.</description>

      <title>Minimal Submanifolds and Waists of Locally Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the higher expansion properties of locally symmetric spaces, with a particular focus on octonionic hyperbolic manifolds. We show that codimension two minimal submanifolds of compact octonionic locally symmetric spaces must have large volume, at least linear in the volume of the ambient space. As a corollary we prove linear waist inequalities for octonionic hyperbolic manifolds in codimension two and construct the first locally symmetric examples of power-law systolic freedom. We also show that any codimension two submanifold of small volume can be homotoped to a lower dimensional set. We use this to prove that branched covers of octonionic hyperbolic manifolds are stable in the sense of Dinur-Meshulam and to establish a uniform lower bound on the non-abelian Cheeger constants of octonionic hyperbolic manifolds.
  In a more general setting, we prove that maps from locally symmetric spaces to low dimensional euclidean spaces admit fibers whose fundamental group has large exponent of growth. We show as a consequence that cocompact lattices in $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ have property $ FA_{\lfloor n/8\rfloor-1}$: any action on a contractible $CAT(0)$ simplicial complex of dimension at most $ \lfloor n/8\rfloor -1$ has a global fixed point.</description>

      <title>Character of Irreducible Representations Restricted to Finite Order Elements -- An Asymptotic Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over the complex numbers and let $T\subset G$ be a maximal torus. For any $t\in T$ of finite order and any irreducible representation $V(\lambda)$ of $G$ of highest weight $\lambda$, we determine the character $ch(t, V(\lambda))$ by using the Lefschetz Trace Formula due to Atiyah-Singer and explicitly determining the connected components and their normal bundles of the fixed point subvariety $(G/P)^t\subset G/P$ (for any parabolic subgroup $P$). This together with Wirtinger's theorem gives an asymptotic formula for $ch(t, V(n\lambda))$ when $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>The complexity of knapsack problems in wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.08086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new complexity results for computational problems in certain wreath products of groups and (as an application) for free solvable group. For a finitely generated group we study the so-called power word problem (does a given expression $u_1^{k_1} \ldots u_d^{k_d}$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d$ are words over the group generators and $k_1, \ldots, k_d$ are binary encoded integers, evaluate to the group identity?) and knapsack problem (does a given equation $u_1^{x_1} \ldots u_d^{x_d} = v$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d,v$ are words over the group generators and $x_1,\ldots,x_d$ are variables, has a solution in the natural numbers). We prove that the power word problem for wreath products of the form $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$ with $G$ nilpotent and iterated wreath products of free abelian groups belongs to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. As an application of the latter, the power word problem for free solvable groups is in $\mathsf{TC}^0$. On the other hand we show that for wreath products $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is a so called uniformly strongly efficiently non-solvable group (which form a large subclass of non-solvable groups), the power word problem is $\mathsf{coNP}$-hard. For the knapsack problem we show $\mathsf{NP}$-completeness for iterated wreath products of free abelian groups and hence free solvable groups. Moreover, the knapsack problem for every wreath product $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is uniformly efficiently non-solvable, is $\Sigma^2_p$-hard.</description>

      <title>Heights of one- and two-sided congruence lattices of semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08229v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The height of a poset $P$ is the supremum of the cardinalities of chains in $P$. The exact formula for the height of the subgroup lattice of the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_n$ is known, as is an accurate asymptotic formula for the height of the subsemigroup lattice of the full transformation monoid $\mathcal{T}_n$. Motivated by the related question of determining the heights of the lattices of left- and right congruences of $\mathcal{T}_n$, we develop a general method for computing the heights of lattices of both one- and two-sided congruences for semigroups. We apply this theory to obtain exact height formulae for several monoids of transformations, matrices and partitions, including: the full transformation monoid $\mathcal{T}_n$, the partial transformation monoid $\mathcal{PT}_n$, the symmetric inverse monoid $\mathcal{I}_n$, the monoid of order-preserving transformations $\mathcal{O}_n$, the full matrix monoid $\mathcal{M}(n,q)$, the partition monoid $\mathcal{P}_n$, the Brauer monoid $\mathcal{B}_n$ and the Temperley-Lieb monoid $\mathcal{TL}_n$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Congruence Subgroup Property for two families of subgroups of Mapping Class Groups of finite-type surfaces. The first one is related to nilpotent quotients of the fundamental group and Johnson filtration, and along the way we give an elementary proof of a theorem of Ben-Ezra-Lubotzky. The second family consists of certain geometric subgroups obtained via subsurface inclusions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometry classification of right-angled Artin groups II: several infinite out cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.02372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are motivated by the question that for which class of right-angled Artin groups (RAAG's), the quasi-isometry classification coincides with commensurability classification. This is previously known for RAAG's with finite outer automorphism groups. In this paper, we identify two classes of RAAG's, where their outer automorphism groups are allowed to contain adjacent transvections and partial conjugations, hence infinite. If $G$ belongs to one of these classes, then any other RAAG $G'$ is quasi-isometric to $G$ if and only if $G'$ is commensurable to $G$. We also show that in this case, there exists an algorithm to determine whether two RAAG's are quasi-isometric by looking at their defining graphs. Compared to the finite out case, as well as the previous quasi-isometry rigidity results for symmetric spaces, thick Euclidean buildings and mapping class groups, the main issue we need to deal with here is the reconstruction map may not have nice properties as before, or may not even exist. We introduce a deformation argument, as well as techniques from cubulation to deal with this issue.</description>

Abstract: In this note we state a conjecture that characterizes unital C*-algebras for which the unitary group is amenable as a topological group in the norm topology. We prove the conjecture for simple, separable, stably finite, unital, $\mathcal Z$-stable, UCT C*-algebras with torsionfree K_0 using the progress on the Elliott classification program for nuclear C*-algebras as well as Pestov's study of amenability of gauge groups. Based on work of Kirchberg, we provide a counterexample to a question of Ng, who proposed a different characterization in earlier work.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Fuglede's conjecture for $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2q^2r}$ and provide a proof under the condition $p^2q^2 \leq r$. We develop a new technique by analyzing the divisibility of the mask polynomial of a given set by a system of cyclotomic polynomials. Combined with the so-called mod-$p$-method, this technique serves as a powerful tool for studying Fuglede's conjecture in this and related cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

Abstract: For negatively curved symmetric spaces it is known from [Hansen-Hilgert-Parthasarathy,2019] that the poles of the scattering matrices defined via the standard intertwining operators for the spherical principal representations of the isometry group are either given as poles of the intertwining operators or as quantum resonances, i.e. poles of the meromorphically continued resolvents of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We extend this result to classical locally symmetric spaces of negative curvature with convex-cocompact fundamental group using results of Bunke and Olbrich. The method of proof forces us to exclude the spectral parameters corresponding to singular Poisson transforms.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of distal actions of automorphisms on the space of one-parameter subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a connected Lie group $G$ and an automorphism $T$ of $G$, we consider the action of $T$ on Sub$_G$, the compact space of closed subgroups of $G$ endowed with the Chabauty topology. We study the action of $T$ on Sub$^p_G$, the closure in Sub$_G$ of the set of closed one-parameter subgroups of $G$. We relate the distality of the $T$-action on Sub$^p_G$ with that of the $T$-action on $G$ and characterise the same in terms of compactness of the closed subgroup generated by $T$ in Aut$(G)$ when $T$ acts distally on the maximal central torus and $G$ is not a vector group. We extend these results to the action of subgroups ${\mathcal H}$ of Aut$(G)$ and equate the distal action of any closed subgroup ${\mathcal H}$ on Sub$^p_G$ with that of every element in ${\mathcal H}$. Moreover, we show that a connected Lie group $G$ acts distally on Sub$^p_G$ by conjugation if and only if $G$ is either compact or it is isomorphic to a direct product of a compact group and a vector group. Some of our results extend those of Shah and Yadav.</description>
