      <title>Vacuum tunneling of vortices in two-dimensional $^4$He superfluid films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At low temperature T we expect vacuum tunneling processes to occur in superfluid $^{4}$ He films. We distinguish between extrinsic processes, in which single vortices nucleate by tunneling off boundaries in the system, and intrinsic processes, in which vortex/anti-vortex pairs nucleate far from boundaries. It is crucial to incorporate the varying effective mass of the vortex in tunneling calculations. The intrinsic processes are the superfluid analogue of the Schwinger mechanism in quantum field theory; here they appear as a quantum phase transition at T = 0, driven by an external supercurrent. We calculate the tunneling rate for these processes, and describe a means of testing the predictions using a specific vortex counting experiment.</description>

      <title>The Infra-Red Road to Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review work in areas ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity, with the following interconnected questions in mind: (i) what is the nature of the vacuum in condensed matter systems, in quantum field theory, and in classical and quantum gravity; (ii) how do analogies between these systems work, how well do they work, and how useful are they; (iii) what modifications can we make to quantum mechanics to deal with quantum gravity, and (iv) how and why low-energy theories of quantum gravity are, in our view, the right way to make progress in this field. We use many different examples to illustrate our arguments.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Self-Trapping and Dynamical Phase Transition in Momentum Space Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-trapping is a hallmark phenomenon of nonlinear dynamics. It has significant applications in modern physics, including band structure engineering, phase transition dynamics, quantum metrology, and more. Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), in which self-trapping can arise from interatomic interactions, are a prime testbed for probing nonlinear dynamics. In this Letter, we report the observation of self-trapping in a spin-orbit coupled BEC subjected to a stationary optical lattice. We employ Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, complemented by a matching optical lattice that facilitates coupling between momentum eigenstates of the spin-orbit coupled system. By ramping the Raman detuning, we probe atomic current flow between these eigenstates and identify a clear distinction between a delocalized mixed state and a self-trapped regime. Following a quench of the Raman detuning, the time-averaged atomic current exhibits non-analytic behavior across the transition between these two regimes in certain parameter ranges, signaling a dynamical phase transition in the system.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamical properties of quadrupolar quantum droplets in quasi-2D condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum droplets, stabilized by beyond-mean-field effects, represent a novel state of matter in quantum many-body systems. While previous studies have focused primarily on dipolar and contact-interacting systems, quadrupolar condensates remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we explore the formation, structural properties, and dynamical behaviors of quantum droplets in a two-component quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a quasi-two-dimensional geometry. Analytical results obtained via the Thomas-Fermi approximation predict flat-topped density profiles and linear scaling between effective area and particle number. These predictions are corroborated by numerical simulations, which also reveal the saturation of peak density and chemical potential at large norm. Furthermore, vortex quantum droplets exhibit anisotropic elliptical morphologies due to the directional nature of QQIs, with their aspect ratios significantly tunable by varying the particle number and quadrupolar interaction strength. Collision dynamics demonstrate rich behavior modulated by velocity and topology: ground-state droplets transition from inelastic merging to quasi-elastic scattering and quantum penetration, while vortex droplets exhibit phase-induced repulsion, fragmentation, and topologically protected tunneling. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order interactions and quantum fluctuations govern the formation and stability of quadrupolar droplets. This work lays a theoretical foundation for experimental realization and opens new directions for exploring anisotropic quantum fluids, topological excitations, and applications in quantum sensing and simulation.</description>

      <title>From elastic to inelastic deformation of a dipolar supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its peculiar superfluid-crystal duality feature, supersolid has received great research interest. Recently, researchers have paid much attention to its elastic response properties; however, the inelastic deformation has barely been explored. In this work, we study the transition from elastic to inelastic deformation of a dipolar supersolid Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a box potential (i.e., a dipolar supersolid with finite size). We obtained the stationary supersolid states (both ground and excited) of the system, and examined the relation between the supersolid size and the number of unit cells it can accommodate, which can essentially help us to understand the dynamical responses of the supersolid during a dilation or compression process. We found that within a certain dilation or compression extent, the supersolid can retain its original crystal structure, that is, it endures an elastic deformation; however, when the extent exceeds a critical threshold, the original crystal structure of the supersolid will be disrupted, which signifies an inelastic deformation. Furthermore, we both analytically and numerically determined the critical point of the transition from elastic to inelastic deformation, and mapped out a phase diagram. These results open up new territory in the research of supersolid mechanical properties, and may find applications in quantum material science and quantum-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Breaking of scale invariance in a strongly dipolar 2D Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70{\deg}, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Observation of area laws in an interacting quantum field simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information shared between parties quantifies their correlation. The encoding of correlations across space and time characterises the structure, history, and interactions of systems. One of the most fundamental properties that emerges from studies of information is the area law, which states that information shared between spatial subregions typically scales with the area of their boundary rather than their volume. In non-interacting, quantum many-body systems, where Gaussian statistics apply, the scaling of information measures is well understood. Within interacting systems, the readout of information measures is impeded by the complexity of state reconstruction. As such, no measurements beyond small quantum systems (e.g., composed of few, localised particles) have been made. Here, we fill this gap by experimentally demonstrating the area law of mutual information in an ultra-cold atom simulator of quantum fields with tuneable interaction strength. Our results detail the scaling of mutual information with subsystem volume, boundary area, and separation between spatial regions at finite temperature. Moreover, we quantify the total effect of non-Gaussian correlations using an information-theoretic measure - relative entropy. Our presented approach is data-driven, model agnostic, and readily applicable to other platforms and observables, thus constituting a universal toolkit for probing information in high-dimensional quantum systems and its role in shaping quantum matter and spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental realization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of dipolar molecules, we develop superfluid transport theory for a dissipative BEC to show that a weak uniform two-body loss can induce phase rigidity, leading to superfluid transport of bosons even without repulsive interparticle interactions. A generalized $f$-sum rule is shown to hold for a dissipative superfluid as a consequence of weak U(1) symmetry. We also demonstrate that dissipation enhances the stability of a molecular BEC with dipolar interactions. Possible experimental signature of dissipative superfluidity are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The exact wavefunction of an isolated three-body resonance at finite scattering length is obtained for two identical particles interacting with another one via a pairwise zero-range potential. The corresponding universal spectrum is studied as a function of the scattering length. The universality of the results is illustrated by considering a model with finite-range interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic Bogoliubov de Gennes (BBdG) Hamiltonians describe the excitations of weakly interacting Bose condensates as well as photonic systems under parametric driving. Their topological features have been studied mainly by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. However, a full characterization of geometrical features in BBdG systems is still lacking. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. The SQGT is directly related to observable properties of BBdG systems. We show how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov-Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enriching condensed-matter systems with quantum optical phenomena currently drives intense research efforts, particularly to introduce collective quantum correlations. Here we access this paradigm, by confining dipolar excitons in a nanoscopic lattice where long-range hopping, and nearest-neighbour dipolar repulsions, dress the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Long-range hopping is evidenced by the spontaneous buildup of many-body sub-radiance, signalled by an algebraic slowdown of excitons radiative dissipation. In addition, we observe a threshold increase of temporal coherence for dipolar quantum solids only. It suggests that excitons condense in a single sub-radiant state for Mott-like phases. These combine then spatial order and collectively extended coherence, in a single degree of freedom. Our study unveils that nanoscopic exciton arrays provide a unique platform to design new frontiers of strongly-correlated lattice models with long-range correlations.</description>

      <title>Scattering resonances and pairing in a Rabi-coupled Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of using a Rabi drive to tune the interactions in an atomic Fermi gas. Specifically, we consider the scenario where two fermion species (spins) are Rabi coupled and interacting with a third uncoupled species. Using an exact calculation within a minimal low-energy model, we derive analytical expressions for the effective scattering length and effective range that characterize the collisions between a Rabi-dressed atom and an atom from the third species. In particular, we find that new scattering resonances emerge in the Rabi-coupled system, which we demonstrate are linked to the existence of hybrid two-body bound states. Furthermore, we show via a generalized Thouless criterion that the scattering properties have a direct impact on the superfluid transitions in the Rabi-coupled Fermi gas. The presence of Rabi-induced resonances thus has implications for the investigation of many-body physics with driven atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-pair superfluidity in a strongly driven Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the paired superfluid phases of a Fermi gas in the presence of a continuous Rabi drive. We focus on the case where two components are strongly coupled by the drive, forming hybrid superpositions, and interacting with an uncoupled third component. Using a generalized Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) ansatz, we show that there are two coupled superfluid order parameters, and we obtain the associated free energy and quasiparticle excitation spectrum. We find that we can drive BCS-BCS, BCS-Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and BEC-BEC crossovers purely by varying the detuning of the Rabi drive from the bare transition, with the precise crossover depending on the sign of the underlying interactions between the coupled and uncoupled components. We furthermore identify an exotic excited branch which features both normal to BCS superfluid transitions, as well as a BCS-BEC-BCS crossover. Introducing a generalized Thouless criterion, we show that this behavior is reflected in the critical temperature for superfluidity. Our Rabi-coupled scenario also gives possesses additional thermodynamic properties related to the pseudospin of the coupled components, which provide novel signatures of the state of the many-body system. The Rabi-driven Fermi gas thus emerges as a unique platform for engineering and probing a rich array of multi-band superfluid phases.</description>

      <title>Chiral Quantum Droplet in a Spin-Orbit Coupled Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the formation of chiral quantum droplet in a spin-orbit coupled Bose gas, where the system turns to a self-bound droplet when moving towards a particular direction and remains gaseous otherwise. The chirality arises from the breaking of Galilean invariance by spin-orbit coupling, which enables the system to dynamically adjust its condensation momentum and spin polarization in response to its velocity. As a result, only towards a specific moving direction and beyond a critical velocity, the acquired spin polarization can trigger collective interactions sufficient for self-binding and drive a first-order transition from gas to droplet. We have mapped out a phase diagram of droplet, gas and their coexistence for realistic spin-orbit coupled 39K mixtures with tunable moving velocity and magnetic detuning. Our results have revealed the emergence of chirality in spin-orbit coupled quantum gases, which shed light on general chiral phenomena in moving systems with broken Galilean invariance.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms necessary for the stabilization of complex quantum correlations by exploring dissipative couplings to nonreciprocal reservoirs. We analyze the role of locality in the coupling between the environment and the quantum system of interest, as we consider either local couplings throughout the system, or a single global coupling. We contrast the results obtained for the two scenarios in which a chain of strongly interacting hardcore bosonic atoms is coupled directly to Markovian kinetic dissipative processes, or experiences effective dissipation through the mediation of the field of a lossy optical cavity. To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a narrow region of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.</description>
