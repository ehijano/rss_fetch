      <title>Emergence of chiral multi-armed spirals in an open system of migrating cells under continuous cell supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality organize living and active matter systems into striking collective states, yet the principles that govern chiral ordering in open systems, where elements are continuously added or removed, remain unclear. A mutant strain of Dictyostelium discoideum deficient in chemotaxis (KI cells) forms centimeter-scale, clockwise multi-armed spirals. Each arm is a traveling band produced by short-range alignment interactions and guided by a polar-ordered rotating core that encircles the cell source. A subtle clockwise bias in the single-cell migration is amplified by collective ordering into tissue-scale chirality. To uncover the minimal ingredients, we developed an open chiral Vicsek model and identified intrinsic chirality and continuous cell supply as the key factors. Our study establishes a general route by which weak microscopic chirality and sustained material flux generate macroscopic chiral order, offering new insight into chiral patterning in multicellular behaviors.</description>

      <title>Neural optimization of the most probable paths of 3D active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a variational neural-network framework to determine the most probable path (MPP) of a 3D active Brownian particle (ABP) by directly minimizing the Onsager-Machlup integral (OMI). To obtain the OMI, we use the Onsager-Machlup variational principle for active systems and construct the Rayleighian of the ABP by including its active power. This approach reveals geometric transitions of the MPP from in-plane I- and U-shaped paths to 3D helical paths as the final time and net displacement are varied. We also demonstrate that the initial and final boundary conditions have a significant impact on the MPPs. Our results show that neural optimization combined with the Onsager-Machlup variational principle provides an efficient and versatile framework for exploring optimal transition pathways in active and nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Surface elasticity effect on Plateau-Rayleigh instability in soft solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft solids exhibit instability and develop surface undulations due to surface effects, a phenomenon known as the elastic Plateau-Rayleigh (PR) instability, driven by the interplay of surface and bulk elasticity. Previous studies on the PR instability in solids mainly focused on the case of constant surface tension and ignored the effect of surface elasticity. It has been shown by experiments that the surface effects in solid-like materials depend both on the surface tension and surface elasticity, but little is known about the role of the latter in the elasto-capillary instabilities in soft solids. Here, we conduct an in-depth exploration of the effect of surface elasticity on the PR instability in an elastic cylinder by coupling theoretical and numerical methods. We derive an asymptotically consistent one-dimensional (1d) model to characterize the PR instability from three-dimensional (3d) nonlinear bulk-surface elasticity, and develop a new finite-element (FE) scheme for simulating 3d deformations of the bulk-surface system. The initiation and evolution of the PR instability are obtained analytically with the aid of the 1d model. The 1d results are further validated by the 3d FE simulations. By synthesizing the 1d analytic solutions and 3d numerical results, the effects of surface elasticity, surface compressibility, surface tension, axial force and geometrical size on the PR instability are thoroughly elucidated. Our results can be applied to calibrate surface parameters for solid-like materials and develop constitutive models for elastic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Modeling adsorption processes on the core-shell-like polymer structures: star and comb topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coagulation-flocculation of pollutants and chelation of heavy metal ions are two widely used techniques in wastewater purification. Despite the differences between their respective mechanisms and inherent length scales, they bear much similarity on a larger scale, and can both be treated as adsorption of obstacles on a polymer structure. In this regime, their adsorbing efficiency is predominantly affected by conformation statistics of involved polymers, and this approach has been used in our previous studies based on lattice polymer model for a linear polymer adsorbent. There is a strong experimental evidence that branched adsorbents are more efficient than their linear counterparts. In this study we focus on two simplest representatives of the core-shell branched architectures: the star-like (with zero-dimensional point-like core) and comb-like polymers (with one-dimensional rigid core) with various number of branches, $f$, branch lengths, $N$, and branches separations, $S$ (for the case of comb-like structure). The polymers are grown on a lattice using the Monte Carlo simulations with the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth algorithm. The quantitative estimates for adsorption capacity in terms of adsorbed obstacles per monomer and the average number of bonds per adsorbed particle (average adsorption strength) have been evaluated in a wide range of parameters $f$, $N$, and $S$. Both the case of implicit diffusion of obstacles (with averaging over different arrangements of immobilized obstacles) and explicit diffusion of obstacles (allowing to study dynamics of adsorption process) have been analyzed. We found that comb-like polymers display the higher adsorption capacity but lower adsorption strength, comparing to the star-like polymers, and these effects are more pronounced with increasing branches separations $S$.</description>

      <title>Effects of Non-reciprocity on Coupled Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All the fundamental interactions (such as gravity or electromagnetic interactions) are reciprocal in nature. However, in the macroscopic world, in particular outside equilibrium, non-reciprocal or non-mutual interactions are quite ubiquitous. Understanding the impact of such non-reciprocal interactions has drawn a significant amount of interest in physics and other fields of sciences in recent years. We explore a non-reciprocal version of coupled oscillators (known as the Kuramoto model) with the aim of understanding the role of non-reciprocity, particularly in relation to chimera states, where oscillators spontaneously break into mutually synchronous and asynchronous groups. Our findings suggest that non-reciprocity not only alters the state diagram of the chimera state significantly but can also lead to new dynamical states, such as traveling chimera, run-and-chase and coexistence phases.</description>

      <title>Collective Buckling in Metal-Organic Framework Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to describe collective buckling in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Starting from the microscopic structure of a single organic linker, we define a buckling coordinate governed by an effective double-well potential. Coupling between linkers arises from dipole-dipole interactions, leading to a lattice Hamiltonian. We analyze the transition between ordered and disordered phases within a mean-field approximation and determine the critical temperature. As an example for our theory, we discuss the collective buckling instability for the prototypical cubic framework MOF-5 under different values of uniaxial strain. Our approach enables a quantitative description of collective buckling in framework materials.</description>

      <title>A one-dimensional model for axisymmetric deformations of an inflated hyperelastic tube of finite wall thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a one-dimensional (1d) model for the analysis of bulging or necking in an inflated hyperelastic tube of {\it finite wall thickness} from the three-dimensional finite elasticity theory by applying the dimension reduction methodology proposed by Audoly and Hutchinson (J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 97, 2016). The 1d model makes it much easier to characterize fully nonlinear axisymmetric deformations of a thick-walled tube using simple numerical schemes such as the finite difference method. The new model recovers the diffuse interface model for analyzing bulging in a membrane tube and the 1d model for investigating necking in a stretched solid cylinder as two limiting cases. It is consistent with, but significantly refines, the exact linear and weakly nonlinear bifurcation analyses. Comparisons with finite element simulations show that for the bulging problem, the 1d model is capable of describing the entire bulging process accurately, from initiation, growth, to propagation. The 1d model provides a stepping stone from which similar 1d models can be derived and used to study other effects such as anisotropy and electric loading, and other phenomena such as rupture.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the aqueous redox properties of functionalized quinones using a new QM/MM variational formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently proposed a method coupling quantum mechanics (QM) methods and molecular density functional theory (MDFT) to describe mixed quantum-classical systems [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 014113 (2024)]. This approach is particularly appropriate to account for solvent effect into QM calculations. We introduce a new variational formulation for the grand potential of a mixed quantum-classical system. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglecting electronic entropy, the quantum solute is described by a product of electronic and nuclear density matrices, both depending parametrically on coordinates of the classical solvent. It can then be shown that a functional of the total density matrix satisfies a variational principle for the grand potential. Using a mean-field approximation, we express the grand potential of the mixed quantum-classical system as a variational problem which depends only on the nuclear density matrix, which experiences an external field generated by the electronic and classical one-particle densities. In practice, the grand potential is computed by a series of coupled classical and quantum DFT calculations, together with geometry optimization.</description>
