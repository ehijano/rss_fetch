      <title>Quantum Calculation for Two-Stream Instability and Advection Test of Vlasov-Maxwell Equations: Numerical Evaluation of Hamiltonian Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Maxwell equations provide kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas, but numerically solving them on classical computers is often impractical. This is due to the computational resource constraints imposed by the time evolution in the 6-dimensional phase space, which requires broad spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we develop a quantum-classical hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell solver. Specifically, the Vlasov solver implements the Hamiltonian simulation based on Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), coupled with a classical Maxwell solver. We perform numerical simulation of a 1D advection test and a 1D1V two-stream instability test on the Qiskit-Aer-GPU quantum circuit emulator with an A100 GPU. The computational complexity of our quantum algorithm can potentially be reduced from the classical $O(N^6T^2)$ to $O(\text{poly}(\log(N),N,T))$ for the $N$ grid system and simulation time $T$. Furthermore, the numerical analysis reveals that our quantum algorithm is robust under larger time steps compared with classical algorithms with the constraint of Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.</description>

      <title>Kinetic scrape off layer simulations with semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin solver for the simulation of the scrape off layer for an electron-ion plasma. We use a time adaptive velocity space to deal with fast particles leaving the computational domain, a block structured mesh to resolve the sharp gradient in the plasma sheath, and limiters to avoid oscillations in the density function. In particular, we propose a limiter that can be computed directly from the information used in the semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin advection step. This limiter is particularly efficient on graphic processing units (GPUs) and compares favorable with limiters from the literature. We provide numerical results for a set of benchmark problems and compare different limiting strategies.</description>

      <title>Regarding the extension of metaplectic geometrical optics to modelling evanescent waves in ray-tracing codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO) is a recently developed ray-tracing framework to accurately compute the wavefield behavior near a caustic (turning point or focal point), where traditional ray-tracing breaks down. However, MGO has thus far been restricted to having real-valued wavevectors. This is disadvantageous because often upon crossing a caustic from the `illuminated' region to the `shadow' region, two real-valued rays coalesce into one complex-valued ray corresponding to the transition from propagating to evanescent behavior. One can distinguish caustics as having either `illuminated shadows' or `proper shadows' -- the former corresponds to when the shadow still contains real-valued rays (albeit in a fewer quantity than in the illuminated region), while the latter corresponds to when the shadow contains no real-valued rays. Here, by means of examples, we show how MGO can be used to model both types of shadows. First, for illuminated shadows we show that MGO can actually be used `as is', provided a corrected quadrature-angle bias is used compared to that proposed in the original references. This is then implemented and demonstrated in a recently developed MGO ray-tracing code. Second, we show that for proper shadows, the MGO formalism can still be used if the symplectic rotation matrix that removes caustics along rays is allowed to be complex-valued. In both cases, strong agreement is seen between the MGO and the exact solution, demonstrating the potential of MGO for improving the predictive capability of ray-tracing codes and laying the foundations for modeling more complicated evanescent phenomena such as tunnelling with MGO.</description>

      <title>Use of current-potential patches to obtain fundamental improvements to the coils of magnetic fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central issue in the design of tokamaks or stellarators is the coils that produce the external magnetic fields. The freedom that remains unstudied in the design of coils is enormous. This freedom could be quickly studied computationally at low cost with high reliability. In particular, the space between toroidal field or modular coils that block access to the plasma chamber could be increased by a large factor. The concept of current-potential patches, which was developed in Todd Elder's thesis, provides a method for separating the study of the feasibility of coils with attractive physics properties from the engineering design of specific coils.</description>

      <title>Compression Acceleration of Protons and Heavier Ions at the Heliospheric Current Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) suggest that protons and heavier ions are accelerated to high energies by magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). By solving the energetic particle transport equation in large-scale MHD simulations, we study the compression acceleration of protons and heavier ions in the reconnecting HCS. We find that the acceleration of multi-species ions results in nonthermal power-law distributions with spectral index consistent with the PSP observations. Our study shows that the high-energy cutoff of protons can reach $E_{max} \sim 0.1$ - $1$ MeV depending on the particle diffusion coefficients. We also study how the high-energy cutoff of different ion species scales with the charge-to-mass ratio $E_{max} \propto (Q/M)^\alpha$. When determining the diffusion coefficients from the quasilinear theory with a Kolmogorov magnetic power spectrum, we find that $\alpha \sim 0.4$, which is somewhat smaller than $\alpha \sim 0.7$ observed by PSP.</description>
