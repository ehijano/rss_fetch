      <title>Selecting Relevant Structural Features for Glassy Dynamics by Information Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the identification of relevant structural features that contribute to the dynamical heterogeneity in a model glass-forming liquid. By employing the recently proposed information imbalance technique, we select these features from a range of physically motivated descriptors. This selection process is performed in a supervised manner (using both dynamical and structural data) and an unsupervised manner (using only structural data). We then apply the selected features to predict future dynamics using a machine learning technique. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of this approach in identifying the dominant mechanisms governing the glassy slow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Anti-correlation between excitations and locally-favored structures in glass-forming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics that are microscopic in space and time, so-called excitations, are considered the elementary unit of relaxation in the Dynamic Facilitation (DF) theory of the glass transition. Meanwhile, geometric motifs known as locally favored structures (LFS) are associated with vitrification in many glassformers. Recent work indicates that the probability of particles both found in locally favored structures (LFS) and excitations decreases significantly upon supercooling suggesting that there is an anti-correlation between them. [Ortlieb et al, Nature Commun. 14, 2621 (2023)]. However, the spatial relationship between excitations and LFS remains unclear. By employing state-of-the-art GPU computer simulations and colloid experiments, we analyze this relationship between LFS and excitations in model glassformers. We demonstrate that there is a spatial separation between the two in deeply supercooled liquids. This may be due to the fact that LFS are well-packed, thus they are solid and stable.</description>

      <title>Chiral active systems near a substrate: Emergent damping length controlled by fluid friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral active fluids show the emergence of a turbulent behavior characterized by multiple dynamic vortices whose maximum size is specific for each experimental system. This is in contrast to hydrodynamic simulations in which the size of vortices is only limited by the system size. We propose and develop an approach to model the effect of friction close to a surface in a particle based hydrodynamic simulation method in two dimensions, in which the friction coefficient can be related to the system parameters and to the emergence of a damping length. This length limits the size of the emergent vortices, and influences other relevant system properties such as the actuated velocity, rotational diffusion, or the cutoff of the energy spectra. Comparison of simulation and experimental results show a good agreement which demonstrates the predictive capabilities of the approach, which can be applied to a wider class of quasi-two-dimensional systems with friction.</description>

      <title>Self-Assembly and Phase Behavior of Janus Rods: Competition Between Shape and Potential Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the self-assembly and phase behavior of Janus rods over a broad range of temperatures and volume fractions, using Langevin dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. The Janus rods consist of a line of fused overlapping spheres that interact via a soft-core repulsive potential, with the addition of an attractive pseudo-square-well tail to a fraction of the spheres (the coverage) ranging from 5\% to 100\% of sites. Competition between the stability of liquid crystal phases originating from shape anisotropy and assembly driven by directional interactions gives rise to a rich polymorphism that depends on the coverage. At low density near the Boyle temperature, we observe the formation of spherical and tubular micelles at low coverage, while at higher coverage randomly oriented monolayers form as the attractive parts of the rods overlap. At higher density, bilayer structures appear and merge to form smectic and crystalline lamellar phases. All of these structures gradually become unstable as the temperature is increased until eventually regular nematic and smectic phases appear, consistent with the hard rod limit. Our results indicate that the intermediate regime where shape-entropic effects compete with anisotropic attractions provided by site specificity is rich in structural possibilities, and should help guide the design of rod-like colloids for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Order metrics of jammed solids: Structures, hyperuniformity, and implications for ultra-stable glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the lack of long-range order, it remains challenging to characterize the structure of disordered solids and understand the nature of the glass transition. Here we propose a new structural order parameter by taking into account multiple rotational symmetries. By studying its statistics for two-dimensional disordered packings of hard particles along the jamming transition line, we observe the evolution from disordered-particle-rich states to ordered-particle-rich states with the increase of packing fraction, together with the unusual non-monotonic change of the degree of hyperuniformity. At the high packing fraction end of the jamming transition line, the packings are mostly composed of ordered particles and are nearly hyperuniform beyond a finite length. Our work links the local order fluctuations to the thermodynamic stability and density fluctuations of disordered solids. Taking advantage of the order parameter, we propose the structural characteristic of ultra-stable glasses: Although globally disordered evaluated by any single symmetry, they are rich of ordered particles and effectively `globally ordered' with crystal-like density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Contraction response of a polyelectrolyte hydrogel under spatially nonuniform electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major challenges in contemporary materials science is to build synthetic structures that can mimic responsive biological tissues, such as artificial skins and muscles. Polyelectrolyte hydrogels can provide such mechanoelectrical responses under external electric fields. Yet, their response to such stimuli, particularly at the molecular scales, is not fully revealed. Here, we study the mechanical response of a semi-infinite polyelectrolyte hydrogel slab to transient and spatially nonuniform sinusoidal electric fields by using extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations show that if the electric field is exerted on a small volumetric section of the hydrogel slab, the entire slab contracts reversibly and uniaxially in the direction perpendicular to the field. The hydrogel contracts almost half of its field-free initial length before retracting its original size, and eventually, its size fluctuations decay similarly exponentially. A contraction maximises when the electric field is applied away from the boundaries of the hydrogel slab. Further, by tuning the electric field frequency and amplitude, both contraction times and efficiency can be controlled. Analyses of contraction times and efficiency with implicit solvent simulations for various electrostatic parameters and salt concentrations confirm the robustness of the phenomenon while highlighting the importance of hydrodynamics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of spatially nonuniform electric fields' effectiveness in manipulating homogenous hydrogel structures for applications requiring rapid and soft actuation components.</description>

      <title>Continuum mechanics of differential growth in disordered granular matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered granular matter exhibits mechanical responses that occupy the boundary between fluids and solids, lacking a complete description within a continuum theoretical framework. Recent studies have shown that, in the quasi-static limit, the mechanical response of disordered solids to external perturbations is anomalous and can be accurately predicted by the theory of odd-dipole-screening. In this work, we investigate responsive granular matter, where grains change size in response to stimuli such as humidity, temperature, or other factors. We develop a geometric theory of odd dipole-screening, incorporating the growth field into the equilibrium equation. Our theory predicts an anomalous displacement field in response to non-uniform growth fields, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations of granular matter. Although the screening parameters in our theory are phenomenological and not derived from microscopic physics, we identify a surprising relationship between the odd parameter and Poissons ratio. This theory has implications for various experimental protocols, including non-uniform heating or wetting, which lead to spatially varying expansion field.</description>

      <title>Liquid droplet morphology on the fiber of a fog harvester mesh and the droplet detachment conditions under gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid droplets on fiber are often observed both in nature and in different engineering applications, like a fog harvesting mesh. Knowledge about drop-on-fiber morphology and its shedding under the influence of gravity can allow for the design of better separation technology. Mutual interaction of surface tension forces arising out of the surface energies of the liquid and the fiber solid, and the weight of the liquid droplet gives rise to different morphologies of the droplet, which may occur in a stable or meta-stable configuration. Predicting the droplet shape on a fiber of specified dimension and surface wettability accurately for a given volume of liquid is challenging since the curvature of both the droplet and the cylinder influence the phenomenon. We have numerically investigated the droplet shape and transition criterion for various volumes at different contact angles under the effect of varying Bond numbers using an open-source surface evolver code. It is observed that depending upon the relative dimensions of the liquid droplet, the fiber diameter, wettability, and gravity, the liquid exists on the fiber either in 'barrel' or in 'clamshell' shape. A relation between shedding volume and the Bond number is deduced, and the detachment volumes are calculated.</description>

      <title>Unifying theory of scaling in drop impact: Forces &amp; maximum spreading diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of drop impact on a rigid surface -- omnipresent in nature and technology -- strongly depends on the droplet's velocity, its size, and its material properties. The main characteristics are the droplet's force exerted on the surface and its maximal spreading radius. The crucial question is: How do they depend on the (dimensionless) control parameters, which are the Weber number $We$ (non-dimensionalized kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity)? Here we perform direct numerical simulations over the huge parameter range $1\le We \le 10^3$ and $10^{-3}\le Oh \le 10^2$ and in particular develop a unifying theoretical approach, which is inspired by the Grossmann-Lohse theory for wall-bounded turbulence [J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27 (2000); PRL 86, 3316 (2001)]. The key idea is to split the energy dissipation rate into the different phases of the impact process, in which different physical mechanisms dominate. The theory can consistently and quantitatively account for the $We$ and $Oh$ dependences of the maximal impact force and the maximal spreading diameter over the huge parameter space. It also clarifies why viscous dissipation plays a significant role during impact, even for low-viscosity droplets (low $Oh$), in contrast to what had been assumed in prior theories.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical Cavity Expansion: A Novel Method for Characterizing the Mechanical Properties of Soft Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low elastic modulus of soft materials, combined with geometric nonlinearity and rate dependence, presents significant challenges in the characterization of their mechanical response. We introduce a novel method for measuring the mechanical properties of soft materials under large deformations via cylindrical cavity expansion. In this method, a cylindrical cavity is fabricated in the material and expanded by volume-controlled injection of an incompressible fluid with simultaneous measurement of the applied pressure at the cavity wall. The relationship between applied pressure and deformation at the cavity wall is then employed to characterize the nonlinear mechanical properties. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and validate it by measuring the mechanical properties of synthetic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and comparing with reported values in the literature. Results indicate that the cylindrical cavitation method effectively captures the response of PDMS over a wide range of stiffness (shear modulus ranging from 5 kPa to 300 kPa) and exhibit high repeatability. The proposed method overcomes limitations in characterization of ultra-soft materials using traditional testing methods, such as challenges with fabrication and clamping in unaxial tension testing and friction and adhesion effects in compression and indentation testing, thus enabling accurate and precise characterization. It also offers improved accuracy and repeatability over other needle induced cavity expansion methods due to precise control over the initial cavity dimension and shape at the cost of increased invasiveness of testing.</description>
