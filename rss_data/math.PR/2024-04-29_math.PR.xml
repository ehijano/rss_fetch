      <title>Refined distributional limit theorems for compound sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is a sketch of systematic presentation of distributional limit theorems and their refinements for compound sums. When analyzing, e.g., ergodic semi-Markov systems with discrete or continuous time, this allows us to separate those aspects that lie within the theory of random processes from those that relate to the classical summation theory. All these limit theorems are united by a common approach to their proof, based on the total probability rule, auxiliary multidimensional limit theorems for sums of independent random vectors, and (optionally) modular analysis.</description>

      <title>Spread-out percolation on transitive graphs of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a vertex-transitive graph of superlinear polynomial growth. Given $r&gt;0$, let $G_r$ be the graph on the same vertex set as $G$, with two vertices joined by an edge if and only if they are at graph distance at most $r$ apart in $G$. We show that the critical probability $p_c(G_r)$ for Bernoulli bond percolation on $G_r$ satisfies $p_c(G_r) \sim 1/\mathrm{deg}(G_r)$ as $r\to\infty$. This extends work of Penrose and Bollob\'as-Janson-Riordan, who considered the case $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$.
  Our result provides an important ingredient in parallel work of Georgakopoulos in which he introduces a new notion of dimension in groups. It also verifies a special case of a conjecture of Easo and Hutchcroft.</description>

      <title>A Notion of Dimension based on Probability on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce notions of dimension of an infinite group, or more generally, a metric space, defined using percolation. Roughly speaking, the percolation dimension $pdim(G)$ of a group $G$ is the fastest rate of decay of a symmetric probability measure $\mu$ on $G$, such that Bernoulli percolation on $G$ with connection probabilities proportional to $\mu$ behaves like a Poisson branching process with parameter 1 in a sense made precise below. We show that $pdim(G)$ has several natural properties: it is monotone decreasing with respect to subgroups and quotients, and coincides with the growth rate exponent for several classes of groups.</description>

      <title>A Breiman's theorem for conditional dependent random vector and its applications to risk theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a Breiman's theorem for conditional dependent random vector, where one component has a regularly-varying-tailed distribution with the index $\alpha\ge0$ and its slowly varying function satisfies a relaxed condition, while the other component is non-negative and its tail distribution is lighter than the former. This result substantially extends and improves Theorem 2.1 of Yang and Wang (Extremes,\ 2013). %with a lower moment condition requirement for many occasions. We also provide some concrete examples and some interesting properties of conditional dependent random vector. Further, we apply the above Breiman's theorem to risk theory, and obtain two asymptotic estimates of the finite-time ruin probability and the infinite-time ruin probability of a discrete-time risk model, in which the corresponding net loss and random discount are conditionally dependent.</description>

      <title>On the spectral edge of non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For general non-Hermitian random matrices $X$ and deterministic deformation matrices $A$, we prove that the local eigenvalue statistics of $A+X$ close to the typical edge points of its spectrum are universal. Furthermore, we show that under natural assumptions on $A$ the spectrum of $A+X$ does not have outliers at a distance larger than the natural fluctuation scale of the eigenvalues. As a consequence, the number of eigenvalues in each component of $\mathrm{Spec}(A+X)$ is deterministic.</description>

      <title>Reduction of the effective population size in a branching particle system in the moderate mutation-selection regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of particles performing a one-dimensional dyadic branching Brownian motion with positive drift $\beta\in(0,1)$, branching rate 1/2, killed at $L(\beta)&gt;0$, and reflected at 0. The killing boundary $L(\beta)$ is chosen so that the total population size is approximately constant, proportional to $N\in\mathbb{N}$. This branching system is interpreted as a population accumulating deleterious mutations.
  We prove that, when the typical width of the cloud of particles is of order $c\log(N)$, $c\in(0,1)$, the demographic fluctuations of the system converge to a Feller diffusion on the time scale $N^{1-c}$. In addition, we show that the limiting genealogy of the system comprises only binary mergers and that these mergers are concentrated in the vicinity of the reflective boundary. This model is a version of the branching Brownian motion with absorption studied by Berestycki, Berestycki and Schweinsberg to describe the effect of natural selection on the genealogy of a population accumulating beneficial mutations. In the latter case, the genealogical structure of the system is described by a Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent on a logarithmic time scale. In this work, we show that, when the population size in the fittest class is mesoscopic, namely of order $N^{1-c}$, the genealogy of the system is given by a Kingman coalescent on a polynomial time scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices with independent entries and a variance profile, as well as an additive deterministic diagonal deformation. We show that the support of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution in the complex plane exactly coincides with the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum in the consecutive limits $n \to \infty$ and $\varepsilon \to 0$. Furthermore, we provide a description of this support in terms of a single real-valued function on the complex plane. As a level set of this locally real analytic function, the spectral edge is a real analytic variety of dimension at most one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complexities of the McKean-Vlasov optimal control problem, exploring its various formulations such as the strong and weak formulations, as well as both Markovian and non-Markovian setups within financial markets. Furthermore, we examine scenarios where the law governing the control process impacts the dynamics of options. By conceptualizing controls as probability measures on a fitting canonical space with filtrations, we unlock the potential to devise classical measurable selection methods, conditioning strategies, and concatenation arguments within this innovative framework. These tools enable us to establish the dynamic programming principle under a wide range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Computational hardness of detecting graph lifts and certifying lift-monotone properties of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new conjecture on the computational hardness of detecting random lifts of graphs: we claim that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can distinguish between a large random $d$-regular graph and a large random lift of a Ramanujan $d$-regular base graph (provided that the lift is corrupted by a small amount of extra noise), and likewise for bipartite random graphs and lifts of bipartite Ramanujan graphs. We give evidence for this conjecture by proving lower bounds against the local statistics hierarchy of hypothesis testing semidefinite programs. We then explore the consequences of this conjecture for the hardness of certifying bounds on numerous functions of random regular graphs, expanding on a direction initiated by Bandeira, Banks, Kunisky, Moore, and Wein (2021). Conditional on this conjecture, we show that no polynomial-time algorithm can certify tight bounds on the maximum cut of random 3- or 4-regular graphs, the maximum independent set of random 3- or 4-regular graphs, or the chromatic number of random 7-regular graphs. We show similar gaps asymptotically for large degree for the maximum independent set and for any degree for the minimum dominating set, finding that naive spectral and combinatorial bounds are optimal among all polynomial-time certificates. Likewise, for small-set vertex and edge expansion in the limit of very small sets, we show that the spectral bounds of Kahale (1995) are optimal among all polynomial-time certificates.</description>

      <title>Upgraded free independence phenomena for random unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study upgraded free independence phenomena for unitary elements $u_1$, $u_2$, \dots in a matrix ultraproduct constructed from the large-$n$ limit of Haar random unitaries. Using a uniform asymptotic freeness argument and volumetric analysis, we establish freeness of several much larger algebras $\mathcal{A}_j$ containing $u_j$, which sheds new light on the structural properties of matrix ultraproducts, as well as free products of tracial von Neumann algebras. First, motivated by Houdayer and Ioana's results on free independence of approximate commutants in free products, we show that the commutants $\{u_j\}'\cap \prod_{n\to \mathcal{U}}\mathbb{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ in the matrix ultraproduct are freely independent. We then prove free independence of the entire Pinsker algebras $\mathcal{P}_j$ containing $u_j$; $\mathcal{P}_j$ by definition is the maximal subalgebra containing $u_j$ with vanishing $1$-bounded entropy in the sense of Hayes, and $\mathcal{P}_j$ contains for instance any amenable algebra containing $u_j$ as well as the entire sequential commutation orbit of $u_j$, and it is closed under taking iterated wq-normalizers. Through an embedding argument, we go back and deduce analogous free independence results for $\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a free product of Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebras $\mathcal{M}_i$, which thus yields a generalization and a new proof of Houdayer--Ioana's results in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear Dirichlet problem on a bounded domain whose Hamiltonian is given by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman operator with merely continuous and bounded coefficients. The objective of this paper is to study the existence question from a stochastic point of view. Using a relaxed control framework, we define a candidate for a viscosity solution. We prove that this stochastic solution satisfies viscosity sub- and supersolution properties and we establish a strong Markov selection principle, which shows that the stochastic solution can be realized through a strong Markov family. Building on the selection principle, we investigate regularity properties of the stochastic solution. For certain elliptic cases, we show that the strong Markov selection is even a Feller selection, which entails the continuity of the stochastic solution.</description>

      <title>On sequences of convex records in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex records have an appealing purely geometric definition. In a sequence of $d$-dimensional data points, the $n$-th point is a convex record if it lies outside the convex hull of all preceding points. We specifically focus on the bivariate (i.e., two-dimensional) setting. For iid (independent and identically distributed) points, we establish an identity relating the mean number $\mean{R_n}$ of convex records up to time $n$ to the mean number $\mean{N_n}$ of vertices in the convex hull of the first $n$ points. By combining this identity with extensive numerical simulations, we provide a comprehensive overview of the statistics of convex records for various examples of iid data points in the plane: uniform points in the square and in the disk, Gaussian points and points with an isotropic power-law distribution. In all these cases, the mean values and variances of $N_n$ and $R_n$ grow proportionally to each other, resulting in finite limit Fano factors $F_N$ and $F_R$. We also consider planar random walks, i.e., sequences of points with iid increments. For both the Pearson walk in the continuum and the P\'olya walk on a lattice, we characterise the growth of the mean number $\mean{R_n}$ of convex records and demonstrate that the ratio $R_n/\mean{R_n}$ keeps fluctuating with a universal limit distribution.</description>

      <title>Separation capacity of linear reservoirs with random connectivity matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the success of reservoir computing lies within the separation capacity of the reservoirs and show that the expected separation capacity of random linear reservoirs is fully characterised by the spectral decomposition of an associated generalised matrix of moments. Of particular interest are reservoirs with Gaussian matrices that are either symmetric or whose entries are all independent. In the symmetric case, we prove that the separation capacity always deteriorates with time; while for short inputs, separation with large reservoirs is best achieved when the entries of the matrix are scaled with a factor $\rho_T/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the dimension of the reservoir and $\rho_T$ depends on the maximum length of the input time series. In the i.i.d. case, we establish that optimal separation with large reservoirs is consistently achieved when the entries of the reservoir matrix are scaled with the exact factor $1/\sqrt{N}$. We further give upper bounds on the quality of separation in function of the length of the time series. We complement this analysis with an investigation of the likelihood of this separation and the impact of the chosen architecture on separation consistency.</description>

      <title>Comparison results for Markov tree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop comparison results for Markov tree distributions extending ordering results from the literature on discrete time Markov processes and recently studied ordering results for conditionally independent factor models to tree structures. Based on fairly natural positive dependence conditions, our main contribution is a comparison result with respect to the supermodular order. Since this order is a pure dependence order, it has many applications in optimal transport, finance, and insurance. As an illustrative example, we consider hidden Markov models and study distributional robustness for functionals of the random walk under model uncertainty. Further, we show that, surprisingly, more general comparison results via the recently established rearrangement-based Schur order for conditional distributions, which implies an ordering of Chatterjee's rank correlation, do not carry over from star structures to trees. Several examples and a detailed discussion of the assumptions demonstrate the generality of our results and provide further insights into the behavior of multidimensional distributions.</description>

      <title>A remark on Gibbs measures with log-correlated Gaussian fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.06729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Gibbs measures with log-correlated base Gaussian fields on the $d$-dimensional torus. In the defocusing case, the construction of such Gibbs measures follows from Nelson's argument. In this paper, we consider the focusing case with a quartic interaction. Using the variational formulation, we prove non-normalizability of the Gibbs measure. When $d = 2$, our argument provides an alternative proof of the non-normalizability result for the focusing $\Phi^4_2$-measure by Brydges and Slade (1996). Furthermore, we provide a precise rate of divergence, where the constant is characterized by the optimal constant for a certain Bernstein's inequality on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also go over the construction of the focusing Gibbs measure with a cubic interaction. In the appendices, we present (a) non-normalizability of the Gibbs measure for the two-dimensional Zakharov system and (b) the construction of focusing quartic Gibbs measures with smoother base Gaussian measures, showing a critical nature of the log-correlated Gibbs measure with a focusing quartic interaction.</description>

Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study the construction of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Gibbs measures, initiated by Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988). This problem turns out to be critical, exhibiting the following phase transition. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we prove normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that it is singular with respect to the massive Gaussian free field. Moreover, we show that there exists a shifted measure with respect to which the $\Phi^3_3$-measure is absolutely continuous. In the strongly nonlinear regime, by further developing the machinery introduced by the authors (2020), we establish non-normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure. Due to the singularity of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure with respect to the massive Gaussian free field, this non-normalizability part poses a particular challenge as compared to our previous works. In order to overcome this issue, we first construct a $\sigma$-finite version of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that this measure is not normalizable. Furthermore, we prove that the truncated $\Phi^3_3$-measures have no weak limit in a natural space, even up to a subsequence.
  We also study the dynamical problem. By adapting the paracontrolled approach, in particular from the works by Gubinelli, Koch, and the first author (2018) and by the authors (2020), we prove almost sure global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model and invariance of the Gibbs measure in the weakly nonlinear regime. In the globalization part, we introduce a new, conceptually simple and straightforward approach, where we directly work with the (truncated) Gibbs measure, using the variational formula and ideas from theory of optimal transport.</description>

      <title>The Brownian transport map</title>

Abstract: Contraction properties of transport maps between probability measures play an important role in the theory of functional inequalities. The actual construction of such maps, however, is a non-trivial task and, so far, relies mostly on the theory of optimal transport. In this work, we take advantage of the infinite-dimensional nature of the Gaussian measure and construct a new transport map, based on the F\"ollmer process, which pushes forward the Wiener measure onto probability measures on Euclidean spaces. Utilizing the tools of the Malliavin and stochastic calculus in Wiener space, we show that this Brownian transport map is a contraction in various settings where the analogous questions for optimal transport maps are open.
  The contraction properties of the Brownian transport map enable us to prove functional inequalities in Euclidean spaces, which are either completely new or improve on current results. Further and related applications of our contraction results are the existence of Stein kernels with desirable properties (which lead to new central limit theorems), as well as new insights into the Kannan--Lov\'asz--Simonovits conjecture.
  We go beyond the Euclidean setting and address the problem of contractions on the Wiener space itself. We show that optimal transport maps and causal optimal transport maps (which are related to Brownian transport maps) between the Wiener measure and other target measures on Wiener space exhibit very different behaviors.</description>

      <title>On the weak convergence of conditioned Bessel bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11328v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the construction of a stochastic process called "$\delta$-dimensional Bessel house-moving" and its properties. We study the weak convergence of $\delta$-dimensional Bessel bridges conditioned from above, and we refer to this limit as $\delta$-dimensional Bessel house-moving. Applying this weak convergence result, we give the decomposition formula for its distribution and the Radon-Nikodym density for the distribution of the Bessel house-moving with respect to the one of the Bessel process. We also prove that $\delta$-dimensional Bessel house-moving is a $\delta$-dimensional Bessel process hitting a fixed point for the first time at $t=1$.</description>

      <title>Latent mutations in the ancestries of alleles under selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a single genetic locus with two alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$ in a large haploid population. The locus is subject to selection and two-way, or recurrent, mutation. Assuming the allele frequencies follow a Wright-Fisher diffusion and have reached stationarity, we describe the asymptotic behaviors of the conditional gene genealogy and the latent mutations of a sample with known allele counts, when the count $n_1$ of allele $A_1$ is fixed, and when either or both the sample size $n$ and the selection strength $\lvert\alpha\rvert$ tend to infinity. Our study extends previous work under neutrality to the case of non-neutral rare alleles, asserting that when selection is not too strong relative to the sample size, even if it is strongly positive or strongly negative in the usual sense ($\alpha\to -\infty$ or $\alpha\to +\infty$), the number of latent mutations of the $n_1$ copies of allele $A_1$ follows the same distribution as the number of alleles in the Ewens sampling formula. On the other hand, very strong positive selection relative to the sample size leads to neutral gene genealogies with a single ancient latent mutation. We also demonstrate robustness of our asymptotic results against changing population sizes, when one of $\lvert\alpha\rvert$ or $n$ is large.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Differential Equations Driven by G-Brownian Motion with Mean Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mean reflected stochastic differential equations driven by G- Brownian motion, where the constraint depends on the distribution of the solution rather than on its paths. Well-posedness is achieved by first investigating the Skorokhod problem with mean reflection under the G-expectation. Two approaches to constructing the solution are introduced, both offering insights into desired properties and aiding in the application of the contraction mapping method. Additionally, a new technique is proposed to prove the first propagation of chaos result for mean reflected G-SDEs, overcoming challenges posed by the nonlinearity of G- expectation and the non-deterministic nature of the quadratic variation of G-Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: We show expansion \textit{\`a la Talay-Tubaro} of a stopped numerical scheme for the Langevin process in the case of a singular potential.

      <title>The contact process with an asymptomatic state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to understand the cost of a potentially high infectiousness of symptomatic individuals or, on the contrary, the benefit of social distancing, quarantine, etc. in the course of an infectious disease, this paper considers a natural variant of the popular contact process that distinguishes between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Infected individuals all recover at rate one but infect nearby individuals at a rate that depends on whether they show the symptoms of the disease or not. Newly infected individuals are always asymptomatic and may or may not show the symptoms before they recover. The analysis of the corresponding mean-field model reveals that, in the absence of local interactions, regardless of the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic, there is an epidemic whenever at least one of the infection rates is sufficiently large. In contrast, our analysis of the interacting particle system shows that, when the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic is small and the asymptomatic individuals are not infectious, there cannot be an epidemic even when the symptomatic individuals are highly infectious.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we give a new and short proof for a theorem of Bodineau stating that the slab percolation threshold $\hat{p}_c$ for the FK-Ising model coincides with the standard percolation critical point $p_c$ in all dimensions $d\geq3$. Both proofs rely on the positivity of the surface tension for $p&gt;p_c$ proved by Lebowitz &amp; Pfister. The key difference is that while Bodineau's proof is based on a delicate dynamic renormalization inspired by the work of Barsky, Grimmett &amp; Newman, our proof utilizes a technique of Benjamini &amp; Tassion to prove the uniqueness of macroscopic clusters via sprinkling, which then implies percolation on slabs through a rather straightforward static renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new approach in the definition of two-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions. Namely, we introduce the classes of two-dimensional long-tailed, of twodimensional dominatedly varying and of two-dimensional consistently varying distributions. Next, we define the closure property with respect to two-dimensional convolution and to joint max-sum equivalence in order to study if they are satisfied by these classes. Further we examine the joint behavior of two random sums, under generalized tail asymptotic independence. Afterward we study the closure property under scalar product and two dimensional product convolution and by these results we extended our main result in the case of jointly randomly weighted sums. Our results contained some applications where we establish the asymptotic expression of the ruin probability in a two-dimensional discrete-time risk model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two methods to obtain $O(1/N^2)$ local propagation of chaos bounds for $N$ diffusive particles in $W^{-1,\infty}$ mean field interaction. This extends the recent finding of Lacker [Probab. Math. Phys., 4(2):377-432, 2023] to the case of singular interactions. The first method is based on a hierarchy of relative entropies and Fisher informations, and applies to the 2D viscous vortex model in the high temperature regime. Time-uniform local chaos bounds are also shown in this case. In the second method, we work on a hierarchy of $L^2$ distances and Dirichlet energies, and derive the desired sharp estimates for the same model in short time without restrictions on the temperature.</description>

      <title>Scaled Brownian motion with random anomalous diffusion exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scaled Brownian motion (SBM) is regarded as one of the paradigmatic random processes, featuring the anomalous diffusion property characterized by the diffusion exponent. It is a Gaussian, self-similar process with independent increments, which has found applications across various fields, from turbulence and stochastic hydrology to biophysics. In our paper, inspired by recent single particle tracking biological experiments, we introduce a process termed the scaled Brownian motion with random exponent (SBMRE), which preserves SBM characteristics at the level of individual trajectories, albeit with randomly varying anomalous diffusion exponents across the trajectories. We discuss the main probabilistic properties of SBMRE, including its probability density function (pdf), and the q-th absolute moment. Additionally, we present the expected value of the time-averaged mean squared displacement (TAMSD) and the ergodicity breaking parameter. Furthermore, we analyze the pdf of the first hitting time in a semi-infinite domain, the martingale property of SBMRE, and its stochastic exponential. As special cases, we consider two distributions of the anomalous diffusion exponent, namely the two-point and beta distributions, and discuss the asymptotics of the presented characteristics in such cases. Theoretical results for SBMRE are validated through numerical simulations and compared with the corresponding characteristics for SBM.</description>

      <title>Decentralized State-Dependent Markov Chain Synthesis with an Application to Swarm Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized state-dependent Markov chain synthesis (DSMC) algorithm for finite-state Markov chains. We present a state-dependent consensus protocol that achieves exponential convergence under mild technical conditions, without relying on any connectivity assumptions regarding the dynamic network topology. Utilizing the proposed consensus protocol, we develop the DSMC algorithm, updating the Markov matrix based on the current state while ensuring the convergence conditions of the consensus protocol. This result establishes the desired steady-state distribution for the resulting Markov chain, ensuring exponential convergence from all initial distributions while adhering to transition constraints and minimizing state transitions. The DSMC's performance is demonstrated through a probabilistic swarm guidance example, which interprets the spatial distribution of a swarm comprising a large number of mobile agents as a probability distribution and utilizes the Markov chain to compute transition probabilities between states. Simulation results demonstrate faster convergence for the DSMC based algorithm when compared to the previous Markov chain based swarm guidance algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new finite form of de Finetti's representation theorem is established using elementary information-theoretic tools. The distribution of the first $k$ random variables in an exchangeable vector of $n\geq k$ random variables is close to a mixture of product distributions. Closeness is measured in terms of the relative entropy and an explicit bound is provided. This bound is tighter than those obtained via earlier information-theoretic proofs, and its utility extends to random variables taking values in general spaces. The core argument employed has its origins in the quantum information-theoretic literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The target stationary distribution problem (TSDP) is the following: given an irreducible stochastic matrix $G$ and a target stationary distribution $\hat \mu$, construct a minimum norm perturbation, $\Delta$, such that $\hat G = G+\Delta$ is also stochastic and has the prescribed target stationary distribution, $\hat \mu$. In this paper, we revisit the TSDP under a constraint on the support of $\Delta$, that is, on the set of non-zero entries of $\Delta$. This is particularly meaningful in practice since one cannot typically modify all entries of $G$. We first show how to construct a feasible solution $\hat G$ that has essentially the same support as the matrix $G$. Then we show how to compute globally optimal and sparse solutions using the component-wise $\ell_1$ norm and linear optimization. We propose an efficient implementation that relies on a column-generation approach which allows us to solve sparse problems of size up to $10^5 \times 10^5$ in a few minutes. We illustrate the proposed algorithms with several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>An optimal advertising model with carryover effect and mean field terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimal advertising problems under uncertainty for the introduction of a new product into the market, on the line of the seminal papers of Vidale and Wolfe, 1957, and Nerlove and Arrow, 1962. The main features of our model are that, on one side, we assume a carryover effect (i.e. the advertisement spending affects the goodwill with some delay); on the other side we introduce, in the state equation and in the objective, some mean field terms which take into account the presence of other agents. We take the point of view of a planner who optimizes the average profit of all agents, hence we fall into the family of the so-called "Mean Field Control" problems. The simultaneous presence of the carryover effect makes the problem infinite dimensional hence belonging to a family of problems which are very difficult in general and whose study started only very recently, see Cosso et Al, 2023. Here we consider, as a first step, a simple version of the problem providing the solutions in a simple case through a suitable auxiliary problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the geometry of binary hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a computational scheme in which data are encoded using high-dimensional binary vectors. We establish a result about the similarity structure induced by the HDC binding operator and show that the Laplace kernel naturally arises in this setting, motivating our new encoding method Laplace-HDC, which improves upon previous methods. We describe how our results indicate limitations of binary HDC in encoding spatial information from images and discuss potential solutions, including using Haar convolutional features and the definition of a translation-equivariant HDC encoding. Several numerical experiments highlighting the improved accuracy of Laplace-HDC in contrast to alternative methods are presented. We also numerically study other aspects of the proposed framework such as robustness and the underlying translation-equivariant encoding.</description>

Abstract: The fields of effective resistance and optimal transport on graphs are filled with rich connections to combinatorics, geometry, machine learning, and beyond. In this article we put forth a bold claim: that the two fields should be understood as one and the same, up to a choice of $p$. We make this claim precise by introducing the parameterized family of $p$-Beckmann distances for probability measures on graphs and relate them sharply to certain Wasserstein distances. Then, we break open a suite of results including explicit connections to optimal stopping times and random walks on graphs, graph Sobolev spaces, and a Benamou-Brenier type formula for $2$-Beckmann distance. We further explore empirical implications in the world of unsupervised learning for graph data and propose further study of the usage of these metrics where Wasserstein distance may produce computational bottlenecks.</description>
