      <title>LogicSparse: Enabling Engine-Free Unstructured Sparsity for Quantised Deep-learning Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FPGAs have been shown to be a promising platform for deploying Quantised Neural Networks (QNNs) with high-speed, low-latency, and energy-efficient inference. However, the complexity of modern deep-learning models limits the performance on resource-constrained edge devices. While quantisation and pruning alleviate these challenges, unstructured sparsity remains underexploited due to irregular memory access. This work introduces a framework that embeds unstructured sparsity into dataflow accelerators, eliminating the need for dedicated sparse engines and preserving parallelism. A hardware-aware pruning strategy is introduced to improve efficiency and design flow further. On LeNet-5, the framework attains 51.6 x compression and 1.23 x throughput improvement using only 5.12% of LUTs, effectively exploiting unstructured sparsity for QNN acceleration.</description>

      <title>An Event-Driven Spiking Compute-In-Memory Macro based on SOT-MRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Magnetic Random-Access Memory (MRAM) in computing-in-memory (CIM) has gained significant attention. However, existing designs often suffer from high energy consumption due to their reliance on complex analog circuits for computation. In this work, we present a Spin-Orbit- Torque MRAM(SOT-MRAM)-based CIM macro that employs an event-driven spiking processing for high energy efficiency. The SOT-MRAM crossbar adopts a hybrid series-parallel cell structure to efficiently support matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). Signal information is (en) decoded as spikes using lightweight circuits, eliminating the need for conventional area- and powerintensive analog circuits. The SOT-MRAM macro is designed and evaluated in 28nm technology, and experimental results show that it achieves a peak energy efficiency of 243.6 TOPS/W, significantly outperforming existing designs.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Mixed-Kernel Mixed-Signal SVMs for Flexible Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03427v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) have emerged as a promising alternative to silicon-based technologies, offering on-demand low-cost fabrication, conformality, and sustainability. However, their large feature sizes severely limit integration density, imposing strict area and power constraints, thus prohibiting the realization of Machine Learning (ML) circuits, which can significantly enhance the capabilities of relevant near-sensor applications. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) offer high accuracy in such applications at relatively low computational complexity, satisfying FE technologies' constraints. Existing SVM designs rely solely on linear or Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels, forcing a trade-off between hardware costs and accuracy. Linear kernels, implemented digitally, minimize overhead but sacrifice performance, while the more accurate RBF kernels are prohibitively large in digital, and their analog realization contains inherent functional approximation. In this work, we propose the first mixed-kernel and mixed-signal SVM design in FE, which unifies the advantages of both implementations and balances the cost/accuracy trade-off. To that end, we introduce a co-optimization approach that trains our mixed-kernel SVMs and maps binary SVM classifiers to the appropriate kernel (linear/RBF) and domain (digital/analog), aiming to maximize accuracy whilst reducing the number of costly RBF classifiers. Our designs deliver 7.7% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art single-kernel linear SVMs, and reduce area and power by 108x and 17x on average compared to digital RBF implementations.</description>

      <title>LM-Fix: Lightweight Bit-Flip Detection and Rapid Recovery Framework for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents LM-Fix, a lightweight detection and rapid recovery framework for faults in large language models (LLMs). Existing integrity approaches are often heavy or slow for modern LLMs. LM-Fix runs a short test-vector pass and uses hash-guided checks to detect bit-flip faults, then repairs them locally without a full reload. Across multiple models, it detects over 94% of single-bit flips at TVL=200 and nearly 100% of multi-bit flips with approximately 1% to 7.7% runtime overhead; recovery is more than 100x faster than reloading. These results show a practical, low-overhead solution to keep LLMs reliable in production</description>

      <title>SnapStream: Efficient Long Sequence Decoding on Dataflow Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03092v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.</description>

      <title>LaMoS: Enabling Efficient Large Number Modular Multiplication through SRAM-based CiM Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barrett's algorithm is one of the most widely used methods for performing modular multiplication, a critical nonlinear operation in modern privacy computing techniques such as homomorphic encryption (HE) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). Since modular multiplication dominates the processing time in these applications, computational complexity and memory limitations significantly impact performance. Computing-in-Memory (CiM) is a promising approach to tackle this problem. However, existing schemes currently suffer from two main problems: 1) Most works focus on low bit-width modular multiplication, which is inadequate for mainstream cryptographic algorithms such as elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and the RSA algorithm, both of which require high bit-width operations; 2) Recent efforts targeting large number modular multiplication rely on inefficient in-memory logic operations, resulting in high scaling costs for larger bit-widths and increased latency. To address these issues, we propose LaMoS, an efficient SRAM-based CiM design for large-number modular multiplication, offering high scalability and area efficiency. First, we analyze the Barrett's modular multiplication method and map the workload onto SRAM CiM macros for high bit-width cases. Additionally, we develop an efficient CiM architecture and dataflow to optimize large-number modular multiplication. Finally, we refine the mapping scheme for better scalability in high bit-width scenarios using workload grouping. Experimental results show that LaMoS achieves a $7.02\times$ speedup and reduces high bit-width scaling costs compared to existing SRAM-based CiM designs.</description>

      <title>AnaFlow: Agentic LLM-based Workflow for Reasoning-Driven Explainable and Sample-Efficient Analog Circuit Sizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.</description>

      <title>FPGA-based Emulation and Device-Side Management for CXL-based Memory Tiering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Compute Express Link (CXL) technology facilitates the extension of CPU memory through byte-addressable SerDes links and cascaded switches, creating complex heterogeneous memory systems where CPU access to various endpoints differs in latency and bandwidth. Effective tiered memory management is essential for optimizing system performance in such systems. However, designing an effective memory tiering system for CXL-extended heterogeneous memory faces challenges: 1) Existing evaluation methods, such as NUMA-based emulation and full-system simulations like GEM5, are limited in assessing hardware-based tiered memory management solutions and handling real-world workloads at scale. 2) Previous memory tiering systems struggle to simultaneously achieve high resolution, low overhead, and high flexibility and compatibility.
  In this study, we first introduce HeteroBox, a configurable emulation platform that leverages real CXL-enabled FPGAs to emulate the performance of various CXL memory architectures. HeteroBox allows one to configure a memory space with multiple regions, each exhibiting distinct CPU-access latency and bandwidth. HeteroBox helps assess the performance of both software-managed and hardware-managed memory tiering systems with high efficiency and fidelity. Based on HeteroBox, we further propose HeteroMem, a hardware-managed memory tiering system that operates on the device side. HeteroMem creates an abstraction layer between the CPU and device memory, effectively monitoring data usage and migrating data to faster memory tiers, thus hiding device-side heterogeneity from the CPU. Evaluations with real-world applications show that HeteroMem delivers high performance while keeping heterogeneous memory management fully transparent to the CPU, achieving a 5.1\% to 16.2\% performance improvement over existing memory tiering solutions.</description>

      <title>AnalogSeeker: An Open-source Foundation Language Model for Analog Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw, unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes, where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models, we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04% accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark, with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research use.</description>
