      <title>Impacts of Blade Camber on Cross-Flow Turbine Performance and Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-flow turbines show promise for renewable energy generation from wind and tidal sources. The rotating reference frame of cross-flow turbine blades results in virtual camber and incidence due to streamline curvature, altering the lift, drag and pitching moment of the blades. Adding geometric camber is therefore likely to alter performance and loading, however there is little consensus regarding the direction of camber that might be most favorable. This study compares 2% concave-in and concave-out cambered blades (NACA 2418) with symmetrical NACA 0018 foils for a turbine with a 0.49 chord-to-radius ratio. Experimental performance measurements are compared across a range of tip-speeds, and particle image velocimetry is used to explore the in-rotor flow evolution through the cycle. Concave-out blades, which enhance virtual camber and lift in the power stroke are found to exhibit sub-optimal performance. In contrast, concave-in cambered blades slightly improved symmetrical blade performance by enhancing downstream flow reattachment, more than compensating for reduced peak power generation. The difference between each cambered foil is seen to grow with increasing tip-speed ratio. Moreover, these concave-in blades reduce peak loading by 13%, which may prove critical in future designs, especially at high tip-speed ratios. Exploration of the near-blade flow fields suggest that the influence of geometric camber is non-linear, and that use of a simplistic summation of both geometric and virtual camber to account for camber effects may be overly simplistic. Despite this, corresponding validated simulations suggest that a small but positive total camber (geometric plus virtual) is optimal for this turbine.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Interplay Between the Chord-to-Radius Ratio, Camber and Pitch of Cross-Flow Turbine Blades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the combined impact of the chord-to-radius ratio (c/R), blade camber, and preset pitch on cross-flow turbine performance. While prior research has examined individual effects of c/R and pitch, this work focuses on their interaction with camber and the resulting aerodynamic behaviors. Central to the analysis is the concept of virtual camber and virtual incidence, which arise from the curved trajectory of the blades, and are quantified using a conformal transformation. Using two experimental datasets -- one varying preset pitch, c/R, blade count, and Reynolds number, and the other examining geometric blade camber and pitch under identical conditions -- this work demonstrates links between blade pitch and camber influences. We propose a potential pathway for reducing the design space by combining geometric variables and coupled virtual effects into two effective parameters: net camber and net incidence. These composite variables provide a more unified and descriptive framework for understanding turbine performance and design behavior, offering a pathway for more consistent optimization of turbine geometry.</description>

      <title>On the algebraic stretching dynamics of variable-density mixing in shock-bubble interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixing mechanism within a single-vortex has been a theoretical focus for decades, while remains unclear especially under variable-density (VD) scenario. This study investigates canonical single-vortex VD mixing in shock-bubble interactions (SBI) through high-resolution numerical simulations. Special attention is paid to examine the stretching dynamics and its impact on VD mixing within a single-vortex, and this problem is investigated by quantitatively characterizing the scalar dissipation rate (SDR), namely mixing rate, and its time integral, referred to as mixedness. We first examine single-vortex passive-scalar (PS) mixing with the absence of density difference. Under several assumptions, the single-vortex stretching rate illustrates an algebraic growth of the length of scalar strips. By incorporating diffusion process through the solution of the advection-diffusion equation along these stretched strips, a PS mixing model for SDR is proposed. Within this framework, density-gradient effects from two perspectives of stretching dynamics and diffusion process are discovered to challenge the extension of PS mixing model to VD mixing. First, the secondary baroclinic effect increases the VD stretching rate by the additional secondary baroclinic principal strain. Second, the density source effect suppresses the diffusion process. By accounting for both the secondary baroclinic effect on stretching and the density source effect on diffusion, a VD mixing model for SBI is further modified. This model establishes a quantitative relationship between the stretching dynamics and the evolution of the mixing rate and mixedness for single-vortex VD mixing over a broad range of Mach numbers. Furthermore, the essential role of stretching dynamics on the mixing rate is demonstrated by the derived dependence of the time-averaged mixing rate on the Peclet number Pe.</description>

      <title>Immersed Boundary Projection Method for Navier Slip Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formulation of the immersed boundary method for incompressible flow over bodies with surface slip described by the Navier boundary condition is presented. In the present method, the wall slip velocity and the boundary force are determined implicitly through a projection to satisfy the boundary conditions and the divergence-free condition of the velocity field as constraints. The present method is first-order accurate in space and fourth-order accurate in time, overcoming the difficulty of the conventional continuous forcing approaches to accurately evaluate the velocity gradient on the boundary. Results from the simulation of the flow past stationary and moving circular cylinders are in good agreement with previous experimental and numerical results for a wide range of slip length on the surface, including the no-slip case.</description>

      <title>Multiscale super-resolution reconstruction of fluid flows with deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multiscale super-resolution framework (SRLBM) that applies deep learning directly to the mesoscopic density distribution functions of the lattice Boltzmann method for high-fidelity flow reconstruction. Two neural network architectures, a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) and a deeper residual dense network (RDN), are trained to upscale distribution functions from coarse grids by factors of 2, 4 and 8, and then recover velocity, pressure, and vorticity from a single model. For flow past a single cylinder at $\mathrm{Re}=100$, RDN reduces the mean relative error in distribution functions by an order of magnitude compared to CNN and avoids spurious pressure oscillations and vorticity smoothing that affect interpolation and simpler networks. To examine the generalization ability, both models are trained using data from the flow past two cylinders of diameter $d$ at a spanwise distance between the centers of $1.5d$ and a Reynolds number of 200. They are then applied without retraining to wake configurations with distances ranging from $2.0d$ to $3.0d$. In these tests, the mean errors remain essentially unchanged across all distances. However, RDN consistently produces sharper shear-layer roll-ups and secondary eddies. These results demonstrate that super-resolving mesoscopic distribution functions yields richer and more transferable features than operating on macroscopic fields alone. By integrating kinetic theory with deep learning, SRLBM offers a compelling alternative for fluid flow reconstruction, enabling a single model to simultaneously recover multiple high-fidelity flow fields while substantially reducing computational cost.</description>

      <title>Characterization of supersonic boundary layers of adiabatic and isothermal curved surfaces with shock interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary layers of adiabatic and isothermal curved walls are investigated for a supersonic turbine cascade, including the effects of shock-boundary layer interactions (SBLIs). Wall-resolved large eddy simulations (LES) are performed for a linear cascade of blades with an inlet Mach number of $M_\infty = 2.0$ and Reynolds number based on the axial chord $Re_\infty = 200\,000$. The wall to inlet temperature ratio of the isothermal case is $T_w/T_{\infty}=0.75$, representing a cooled wall. An assessment of the effects of pressure gradient, thermal boundary conditions and SBLIs is presented in terms of the downstream variation of mean flow quantities such as density, temperature, and momentum profiles. The different thermal boundary conditions affect the density and temperature profiles along the boundary layer, where cooling increases the density of the gas near the wall, and reduces its temperature and viscosity. Both of these effects make the momentum profiles fuller and, hence, the boundary layer of the isothermal case is less prone to separate than that of the adiabatic wall. The mean density profiles are also affected by pressure gradients induced by the convex and concave curvatures of the blade, which lead to expansion and compression of the flow, respectively. The analysis of separate terms from the momentum balance equation explains the behavior of various physical mechanisms in the inner and outer regions of the supersonic boundary layers. The importance of mean flow advection, compressibility, and Reynolds stresses is presented in terms of flow acceleration and deceleration. The impact of the SBLIs in the momentum balance mechanisms is also investigated, showing that a combination of compressions and expansions impact the boundary layers by redirecting the flow toward the wall due to the shock formations.</description>

      <title>Physical mechanism behind the early onset of the ultimate state in supergravitational centrifugal thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and numerical investigation of the transition from the classical to the ultimate regime of thermal turbulence in a supergravitational centrifugal convection system. The transition is found to be robust, with the critical Rayleigh number decreasing systematically as the Froude number, defined as the ratio of centrifugal to Earth's gravity, decreases, highlighting the effect of residual gravity. Once the Rayleigh number reaches the transition threshold, the Stewartson layer induced by residual Earth gravity becomes comparable in thickness to the viscous boundary layer, and their interaction results in a coupled flow that distorts the viscous boundary layer, triggering its transition from laminar to turbulent flow and leading to a sharp increase in heat transport. These findings demonstrate the key role of the Stewartson layer induced by residual gravity in facilitating the transition to the ultimate regime in supergravitational centrifugal thermal convection.</description>

      <title>Pinch-off dynamics for a Newtonian liquid thread draining in a viscoplastic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinch-off dynamics of a Newtonian liquid thread embedded in a viscoplastic medium is investigated using direct numerical simulations and theory. Thread breakup occurs below a nearly universal threshold set by the balance of capillary and yield stresses, largely independent of the viscosity ratio at low Ohnesorge numbers. Regime maps in the Ohnesorge-plastocapillary number plane reveal distinct boundaries, and scaling analysis captures the minimum thread radius in excellent agreement with simulations. These results provide a predictive framework for thread dynamics in complex fluids and highlight the role of stress localization in viscoplastic environments. The obtained insights are relevant for embedded additive manufacturing and other technologies involving fluid threads in complex media.</description>

      <title>Super resonance: Breaking the bandwidth limit of resonant modes and its application to flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of super resonance--a new regime of resonant behavior in which a mode's out-of-phase response persists far beyond its classical bandwidth. This effect emerges from a coiled phononic structure composed of a locally resonant elastic metamaterial and architected to support multiple internal energy pathways. These pathways converge at a single structural point, enabling extended modal dominance and significantly broadening the frequency range over which a resonant phase is sustained. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations the implications of this mechanism in the context of flow instability control, where current approaches are inherently constrained by the characteristically narrow spectral bandwidth of conventional resonances. Using a super-resonant phononic subsurface structure interfacing with a channel flow, we show passive simultaneous suppression of four unstable flow perturbations across a frequency range more than five times wider than that is achievable with a standard resonance in an equivalent uncoiled structure. By enabling broadband, passive control of flow instabilities, super resonance overcomes a longstanding limitation in laminar flow control strategies. More broadly, it introduces a powerful new tool for phase-engineered wave-matter interaction. The ability to preserve out-of-phase modal response across wide spectral ranges establishes a fundamental advance in the physics of resonance, with far-reaching implications for suppressing fully developed turbulent flows and beyond.</description>

      <title>A General Model for Static Contact Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of contact angle and hysteresis determination has direct implications for engineering applications of wetting, colloid and surface science. Significant technical challenges can arise under real-world operating conditions, because the static contact angle is strongly influenced by contamination at the liquid-solid and liquid-vapor interfaces, chemical aging over long times, and environmental variables such as relative humidity and temperature. Analytical models that account for these real-world effects are therefore highly desirable to guide the rational design of robust applications. This work proposes a unified and simple-to-use model that expands Young's local thermodynamic approach to consider surfaces with topographic features of general geometry and varying degrees of liquid infiltration. The unified model recovers classical wetting limits (Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and hemiwicking), accounts for observable intermediate states (e.g., impregnating Cassie), and identifies a new limiting state with potential realizability: a Cassie state accompanied by a precursor film, termed the Inverse Wenzel state.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale analysis of flow over heterogeneous urban environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A computationally efficient multi-scale planar-averaging framework for urban areas is developed, which enables efficient computation of coarse-grained velocity and scalar fields. We apply the multi-scale framework to a large-eddy simulation of an idealised heterogeneous urban environment of 512 buildings based on a typical London height distribution. We observe that for this geometry, the characteristic urban lengthscale $\ell \approx$ 50 m, which is the averaging lengthscale L at which as much variance in the mean flow is resolved as is unresolved. For $L&gt;400$ m, the statistics become approximately homogeneous, suggesting that non-building-resolving numerical weather prediction (NWP) models can be applied without modification at resolutions of 400 m and above for the case under consideration. We derive the multi-scale plane- and Reynolds-averaged momentum equation and show that for neutral cases, NWP models require parameterisation of the distributed drag and the unresolved turbulence and dispersive stress. An a priori analysis reveals that the drag parameterisation from Sutzl et al. 2020, Bound-Layer Meteorol., 178:225-248 holds reasonably well for resolutions $L$ above 200 m. Below this value, the problem becomes inhomogeneous and the parameterisation works less well. The unresolved stresses are well represented by a $k-\omega$ closure with a value of $\omega=0.4/s$. However, an even more accurate closure can be derived from the Sutzl drag parameterisation that does not require further turbulence information.</description>
