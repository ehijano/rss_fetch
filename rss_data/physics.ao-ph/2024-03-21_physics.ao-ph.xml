      <title>Assessing the Spurious Impacts of Ice-Constraining Methods on the Climate Response to Sea-Ice Loss using an Idealised Aquaplanet GCM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled climate model simulations designed to isolate the effects of Arctic sea-ice loss often apply artificial heating, either directly to the ice or through modification of the surface albedo, to constrain sea-ice in the absence of other forcings. Recent work has shown that this approach may lead to an overestimation of the climate response to sea-ice loss. In this study, we assess the spurious impacts of ice-constraining methods on the climate of an idealised aquaplanet general circulation model (GCM) with thermodynamic sea-ice. The true effect of sea-ice loss in this model is isolated by inducing ice loss through reduction of the freezing point of water, which does not require additional energy input. We compare results from freezing point modification experiments with experiments where sea-ice loss is induced using traditional ice-constraining methods, and confirm the result of previous work that traditional methods induce spurious additional warming. Furthermore, additional warming leads to an overestimation of the circulation response to sea-ice loss, which involves a weakening of the zonal wind and storm track activity in midlatitudes. Our results suggest that coupled model simulations with constrained sea-ice should be treated with caution, especially in boreal summer, where the true effect of sea-ice loss is weakest but we find the largest spurious response. Given that our results may be sensitive to the simplicity of the model we use, we suggest that devising methods to quantify the spurious effects of ice-constraining methods in more sophisticated models should be an urgent priority for future work.</description>

      <title>Early Flood Warning Using Satellite-Derived Convective System and Precipitation Data -- A Retrospective Case Study of Central Vietnam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of an early flood warning caused by complex convective systems (CSs), by using Low-Earth Orbit and Geostationary satellite data. We focus on a sequence of extreme events that took place in central Vietnam during October 2020, with a specific emphasis on the events leading up to the floods, i.e., those occurring before October 10th, 2020. In this critical phase, several hydrometeorological indicators could be identified thanks to an increasingly advanced and dense observation network composed of Earth Observation satellites, in particular those enabling the characterization and monitoring of a CS, in terms of low-temperature clouds and heavy rainfall. Himawari-8 images, both individually and in time-series, allow identifying and tracking convective clouds. This is complemented by the observation of heavy/violent rainfall through GPM IMERG data, as well as the detection of strong winds using radiometers and scatterometers. Collectively, these datasets, along with the estimated intensity and duration of the event from each source, form a comprehensive dataset detailing the intricate behaviors of CSs. All of these factors are significant contributors to the magnitude of flooding and the short-term dynamics anticipated in the studied region.</description>

      <title>Questioning whether seasonal advance of intense tropical cyclones since the 1980s truly exists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shan et al. (2023) recently reported significant seasonal advances of intense tropical cyclones (TCs) in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) since the 1980s and emphasized the data insensitivity of this conclusion, based on the advanced Dvorak Technique-Hurricane Satellite (ADT-HURSAT) and the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) datasets. However, upon rigorously repeating the analysis procedure in Shan et al. (2023), we are unable to replicate their conclusion. Our analyses reveal that insignificant trends in median of intense TC occurrence dates (hereafter referred to as $\tilde{date}_{intenseTC}$) are observed in the SH based on the ADT-HURSAT, and in both hemispheres based on the IBTrACS. In addition, we discover inconsistencies in $\tilde{date}_{intenseTC}$ trends between the two datasets, which primarily arise from the differences in identification of intense TC cases. The above discrepancies raise doubts about the reproducibility and validity of Shan et al.'s conclusions regarding the seasonal advance of intense TCs. Based on these findings, as well as the limitations of both datasets, we argue that the reported seasonal advance of intense TCs since the 1980s is inconclusive and further investigations with alternative datasets and approaches are needed.</description>
