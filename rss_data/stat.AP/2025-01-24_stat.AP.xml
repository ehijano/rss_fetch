      <title>Sequential One-Sided Hypothesis Testing of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing whether a given stochastic process is generated by a known Markov chain. Formally, given access to a stream of random variables, we want to quickly determine whether this sequence is a trajectory of a Markov chain with a known transition matrix $P$ (null hypothesis) or not (composite alternative hypothesis). This problem naturally arises in many engineering problems.
  The main technical challenge is to develop a sequential testing scheme that adapts its sample size to the unknown alternative. Indeed, if we knew the alternative distribution (that is, the transition matrix) $Q$, a natural approach would be to use a generalization of Wald's sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Building on this intuition, we propose and analyze a family of one-sided SPRT-type tests for our problem that use a data-driven estimator $\hat{Q}$. In particular, we show that if the deployed estimator admits a worst-case regret guarantee scaling as $\mathcal{O}\left( \log{t} \right)$, then the performance of our test asymptotically matches that of SPRT in the simple hypothesis testing case. In other words, our test automatically adapts to the unknown hardness of the problem, without any prior information. We end with a discussion of known Markov chain estimators with $\mathcal{O}\left( \log{t} \right)$ regret.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Whole-Genome Signal Region Detection for Quantitative and Binary Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of genetic signal regions in the human genome is critical for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. Numerous methods based on scan algorithms (i.e. QSCAN, SCANG, SCANG-STARR) have been developed to allow dynamic window sizes in whole-genome association studies. Beyond scan algorithms, we have recently developed the binary and re-search (BiRS) algorithm, which is more computationally efficient than scan-based methods and exhibits superior statistical power. However, the BiRS algorithm is based on two-sample mean test for binary traits, not accounting for multidimensional covariates or handling test statistics for non-binary outcomes. In this work, we present a distributed version of the BiRS algorithm (dBiRS) that incorporate a new infinity-norm test statistic based on summary statistics computed from a generalized linear model. The dBiRS algorithm accommodates regression-based statistics, allowing for the adjustment of covariates and the testing of both continuous and binary outcomes. This new framework enables parallel computing of block-wise results by aggregation through a central machine to ensure both detection accuracy and computational efficiency, and has theoretical guarantees for controlling family-wise error rates and false discovery rates while maintaining the power advantages of the original algorithm. Applying dBiRS to detect genetic regions associated with fluid intelligence and prospective memory using whole-exome sequencing data from the UK Biobank, we validate previous findings and identify numerous novel rare variants near newly implicated genes. These discoveries offer valuable insights into the genetic basis of cognitive performance and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the potential of dBiRS as a scalable and powerful tool for whole-genome signal region detection.</description>

      <title>Effect Size-Driven Pathway Meta-Analysis for Gene Expression Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of omics datasets in public repositories has created unprecedented opportunities for biomedical research but has also posed significant challenges for their integration, particularly due to missing genes and platform-specific discrepancies. Traditional gene expression metaanalysis often focuses on individual genes, leading to data loss and limited biological insights when there are missing genes across different studies. To address these limitations, we propose GSEMA (Gene Set Enrichment Meta-Analysis), a novel methodology that leverages singlesample enrichment scoring to aggregate gene expression data into pathway-level matrices. By applying meta-analysis techniques to enrichment scores, GSEMA preserves the magnitude and directionality of effects, enabling the definition of pathway activity across datasets. Using simulated data and case studies on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), we demonstrate that GSEMA outperforms other methods in controlling false positive rates while providing meaningful biological interpretations. GSEMA methodology is implemented as an R package available on CRAN repository</description>

      <title>Topic Modeling for Free-Response Text Data from a Complex Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic Modeling is a popular statistical tool commonly used on textual data to identify the hidden thematic structure in a document collection based on the distribution of words. Additionally, it can be used to cluster the documents, with clusters representing distinct topics. The Mixture of Unigrams (MoU) is a standard topic model for clustering document-term data and can be particularly useful for analyzing open-ended survey responses to extract meaningful information from the underlying topics. However, with complex survey designs, where data is often collected on individual (document) characteristics, it is essential to account for the sample design in order to avoid biased estimates. To address this issue, we propose the MoU model under informative sampling using a pseudolikelihood to account for the sample design in the model by incorporating survey weights. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach through a simulation study and illustrate its application using two datasets from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We compare our pseudolikelihood-based MoU model to the traditional MoU and assess its effectiveness in extracting meaningful topics from survey data. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mixture of Unigrams (hMoU) accounting for informative sampling where topic proportions are defined as functions of document-level fixed and random effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through an application to ANES data comparing topic proportions across respondent-level factors such as gender, race, age group, and state.</description>

      <title>Modelling superspreading dynamics and circadian rhythms in online discussion boards using Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online boards offer a platform for sharing and discussing content, where discussion emerges as a cascade of comments in response to a post. Branching point process models offer a practical approach to modelling these cascades; however, existing models do not account for apparent features of empirical data. We address this gap by illustrating the flexibility of Hawkes processes to model data arising from this context as well as outlining the computational tools needed to service this class of models. For example, the distribution of replies within discussions tends to have a heavy tail. As such, a small number of posts and comments may generate many replies, while most generate few or none, similar to `superspreading' in epidemics. Here, we propose a novel model for online discussion, motivated by a dataset arising from discussions on the r/ireland subreddit, that accommodates such phenomena and develop a framework for Bayesian inference that considers in- and out-of-sample tests for goodness-of-fit. This analysis shows that discussions within this community follow a circadian rhythm and are subject to moderate superspreading dynamics. For example, we estimate that the expected discussion size is approximately four for initial posts between 04:00 and 12:00 but approximately 2.5 from 15:00 to 02:00. We also estimate that 58% to 62% of posts fail to generate any discussion, with 95% posterior probability. Thus, we demonstrate that our framework offers a general approach to modelling discussion on online boards.</description>

      <title>A car-following model with behavioural adaptation to road geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the effect of road geometry on human driving behaviour is essential for both road safety studies and traffic microsimulation. Research on this topic is still limited, mainly focusing on free-flow traffic and not adequately considering the influence of curvature on car-following dynamics. This work attempts to investigate this issue and model the adaptation of car-following behaviour to horizontal curvature. For this purpose, the maximum desired speed - which mainly determines the free-flow dynamics - is expressed as a parsimonious function of the curvature. A spatial anticipation mechanism is also included in order to realistically describe the driving behaviour when approaching or exiting from curves. The accuracy of the augmented model is evaluated using the Modified Intelligent Driver Model (M-IDM) and trajectory data from free-flow and car-following traffic (Naples data and Zen Traffic Data). The results show that a significant improvement is achieved in free-flow dynamics. In car-following situations, improvements are mainly observed at high speed and are dependent on the observed driver. Overall, the analysis highlights the lack of sufficiently spatially extended trajectory data to calibrate and evaluate such driving behaviours.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Record Linkage Approach to Applications in Tree Demography Using Overlapping LiDAR Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the information age, it has become increasingly common for data containing records about overlapping individuals to be distributed across multiple sources, making it necessary to identify which records refer to the same individual. The goal of record linkage is to estimate this unknown structure in the absence of a unique identifiable attribute. We introduce a Bayesian hierarchical record linkage model for spatial location data motivated by the estimation of individual specific growth-size curves for conifer species using data derived from overlapping LiDAR scans. Annual tree growth may be estimated dependent upon correctly identifying unique individuals across scans in the presence of noise. We formalize a two-stage modeling framework, connecting the record linkage model and a flexible downstream individual tree growth model, that provides robust uncertainty quantification and propagation through both stages of the modeling pipeline via an extension of the linkage-averaging approach of Sadinle (2018). In this paper, we discuss the two-stage model formulation, outline the computational strategies required to achieve scalability, assess the model performance on simulated data, and fit the model to a bi-temporal dataset derived from LiDAR scans of the Upper Gunnison Watershed provided by the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory to assess the impact of key topographic covariates on the growth behavior of conifer species in the Southern Rocky Mountains (USA).</description>

      <title>Generalizability with ignorance in mind: learning what we do (not) know for archetypes discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When studying policy interventions, researchers are often interested in two related goals: i) learning for which types of individuals the program has the largest effects (heterogeneity) and ii) understanding whether those patterns of treatment effects have predictive power across environments (generalizability). To that end, we develop a framework to learn from the data how to partition observations into groups of individual and environmental characteristics whose effects are generalizable for others - a set of generalizable archetypes. Our view is that implicit in the task of archetypal discovery is detecting those contexts where effects do not generalize and where researchers should collect more evidence before drawing inference on treatment effects. We introduce a method that jointly estimates when and how a prediction can be formed and when, instead, researchers should admit ignorance and elicit further evidence before making predictions. We provide both a decision-theoretic and Bayesian foundation of our procedure. We derive finite-sample (frequentist) regret guarantees, asymptotic theory for inference, and discuss computational properties. We illustrate the benefits of our procedure over existing alternatives that would fail to admit ignorance and force pooling across all units by re-analyzing a multifaceted program targeted towards the poor across six different countries.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing ecological community dynamics from limited observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ecosystems tend to fluctuate around stable equilibria in response to internal dynamics and environmental factors. Occasionally, they enter an unstable tipping region and collapse into an alternative stable state. Our understanding of how ecological communities vary over time and respond to perturbations depends on our ability to quantify and predict these dynamics. However, the scarcity of long, dense time series data poses a severe bottleneck for characterising community dynamics using existing methods. We overcome this limitation by combining information across multiple short time series using Bayesian inference. By decomposing dynamics into deterministic and stochastic components using Gaussian process priors, we predict stable and tipping regions along the community landscape and quantify resilience while addressing uncertainty. After validation with simulated and real ecological time series, we use the model to question common assumptions underlying classical potential analysis and re-evaluate the stability of previously proposed "tipping elements" in the human gut microbiota.</description>

      <title>Evidence of social learning across symbolic cultural barriers in sperm whales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide quantitative evidence suggesting social learning in sperm whales across socio-cultural boundaries, using acoustic data from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Traditionally, sperm whale populations are categorized into clans based on their vocal repertoire: the rhythmically patterned click sequences (codas) that they use. Among these codas, identity codas function as symbolic markers for each clan, accounting for 35-60% of codas they produce. We introduce a computational method to model whale speech, which encodes rhythmic micro-variations within codas, capturing their vocal style. We find that vocal style-clans closely align with repertoire-clans. However, contrary to vocal repertoire, we show that sympatry increases vocal style similarity between clans for non-identity codas, i.e. most codas, suggesting social learning across cultural boundaries. More broadly, this subcoda structure model offers a framework for comparing communication systems in other species, with potential implications for deeper understanding of vocal and cultural transmission within animal societies.</description>

      <title>Data-driven upper bounds and event attribution for unprecedented heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen numerous record-shattering heatwaves in all corners of the globe. In the aftermath of these devastating events, there is interest in identifying worst-case thresholds or upper bounds that quantify just how hot temperatures can become. Generalized Extreme Value theory provides a data-driven estimate of extreme thresholds; however, upper bounds may be exceeded by future events, which undermines attribution and planning for heatwave impacts. Here, we show how the occurrence and relative probability of observed events that exceed a priori upper bound estimates, so-called "impossible" temperatures, has changed over time. We find that many unprecedented events are actually within data-driven upper bounds, but only when using modern spatial statistical methods. Furthermore, there are clear connections between anthropogenic forcing and the "impossibility" of the most extreme temperatures. Robust understanding of heatwave thresholds provides critical information about future record-breaking events and how their extremity relates to historical measurements.</description>

      <title>Estimation of conditional inequality measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical inequality measures such as the Gini index are often used to describe the sparsity of the distribution of a certain feature in a population. It is sometimes also used to compare the inequalities between some subpopulations, conditioned on certain values of the covariates. The concept of measuring inequality in subpopulation was described in the literature and it is strongly related to the decomposition of the Gini index. In this paper, the idea of conditional inequality measures is extended to the case where covariates are continuous. Curves of conditional inequality measures are introduced, especially, the curves of the conditional quantile versions of the Zenga and $D$ indices are considered. Various methods of their estimation based on quantile regression are presented. An approach using isotonic regression is used to prevent quantile crossing in quantile regression. The accuracy of the estimators considered is compared in simulation studies. Furthermore, an analysis of the growth in salary inequalities with respect to employee age is included to demonstrate the potential of conditional inequality measures.</description>
