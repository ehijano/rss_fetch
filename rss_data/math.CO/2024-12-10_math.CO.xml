      <title>Identifiability of catenary and directed-cycle linear compartmental models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parameter of a mathematical model is structurally identifiable if it can be determined from noiseless experimental data. Here, we examine the identifiability properties of two important classes of linear compartmental models: directed-cycle models and catenary models (models for which the underlying graph is a directed cycle or a bidirected path, respectively). Our main result is a complete characterization of the directed-cycle models for which every parameter is (generically, locally) identifiable. Additionally, for catenary models, we give a formula for their input-output equations. Such equations are used to analyze identifiability, so we expect our formula to support future analyses into the identifiability of catenary models. Our proofs rely on prior results on input-output equations, and we also use techniques from linear algebra and graph theory.</description>

      <title>Vertex-distinguishing and sum-distinguishing edge coloring of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer $k\ge1$, an edge-$k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of $k$ colors $1,\ldots,k$ to the edges of $G$ such that no two adjacent edges receive the same color. A vertex-distinguishing (resp. sum-distinguishing) edge-$k$-coloring of $G$ is an edge-$k$-coloring such that for any two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$, the set (resp. sum) of colors taken from all the edges incident with $u$ is different from that taken from all the edges incident with $v$. The vertex-distinguishing chromatic index (resp. sum-distinguishing chromatic index), denoted $\chi'_{vd}(G)$ (resp. $\chi'_{sd}(G)$), is the smallest value $k$ such that $G$ has a vertex-distinguishing-edge-$k$-coloring (resp. sum-distinguishing-edge-$k$-coloring). Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, where $n$ is even and sufficiently large. We show that $\chi'_{vd}(G) =d+2$ if $d$ is arbitrarily close to $n/2$ from above, and $\chi'_{sd}(G) =d+2$ if $d\ge \frac{2n}{3}$. Our first result strengthens a result of Balister et al. in 2004 for such class of regular graphs, and our second result constitutes a significant advancement in the field of sum-distinguishing edge coloring.
  To achieve these results, we introduce novel edge coloring results which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A cospectral construction for the generalized distance matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized distance matrix of a graph is a matrix in which the $(i,j)$th entry is a function, $f$, of the distance between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$. Depending on the choice of $f$, this family of matrices includes both the adjacency matrix and the traditional distance matrix. We present a cospectral construction for the generalized distance matrix akin to Godsil-McKay Switching. We also investigate a special case of the generalized distance matrix: the exponential distance matrix, which is a matrix where every entry is a value $q$ raised to the power of the distance between the vertices. We give an upper bound on the values of $q$ needed to show a pair of graphs is cospectral for all values of $q$ corresponding to the diameter of the graphs.
  We also give cospectral constructions unique to value $q=1/2$.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial representation of Arrow's single-peaked domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most studied class of Condorcet domains (acyclic sets of linear orders) is the class of peak-pit domains of maximal width. It has a number of combinatorial representations by such familiar combinatorial objects like rhombus tilings and arrangements of pseudolines. Arrow's single-peaked domains are peak-pit but do not have maximal width. We suggest how to represent them by means of generalised arrangements of pseudolines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the triple Riordan group, whose elements consist of $4$-tuples of power series $(g, f_1, f_2, f_3)$ with $g\in \mathbf{R}[[x^3]]$, and $f_1, f_2, f_3 \in x\mathbf{R}[[x^3]]$, for an appropriate ring $\mathbf{R}$. The construction of this group generalizes that of the double Riordan group, and lays the pattern for further generalizations.</description>

      <title>Clique covers and decompositions of cliques of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1966, Erd\H{o}s, Goodman, and P\'{o}sa showed that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph, then at most $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$ cliques of $G$ are needed to cover the edges of $G$, and the bound is best possible as witnessed by the balanced complete bipartite graph. This was generalized independently by Gy\H{o}ri--Kostochka, Kahn, and Chung, who showed that every $n$-vertex graph admits an edge-decomposition into cliques of total `cost' at most $2 \lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$, where an $i$-vertex clique has cost $i$. Erd\H{o}s suggested the following strengthening: every $n$-vertex graph admits an edge-decomposition into cliques of total cost at most $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$, where now an $i$-vertex clique has cost $i-1$. We prove fractional relaxations and asymptotically optimal versions of both this conjecture and a conjecture of Dau, Milenkovic, and Puleo on covering the $t$-vertex cliques of a graph instead of the edges. Our proofs introduce a general framework for these problems using Zykov symmetrization, the Frankl-R\"odl nibble method, and the Szemer\'edi Regularity Lemma.</description>

      <title>Tor Groups of the Stanley-Reisner Ring of a Matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Tor groups $ \mathop{Tor}_{\bullet}^{S_{\mathrm{M}}^{\circ}} \left( \mathbb{C}[\Sigma_{\mathrm{M}}], \mathbb{C} \right)_{\bullet} $ for a loopless matroid $\mathrm{M}$ as a way to study the extra relations occurring in the linear ideal of the Feichtner-Yuzvinsky presentation of the Chow ring $ A^{\bullet}(\mathrm{M}) $. This extends the definition of the Chow ring of a matroid since $ \mathop{Tor}_{0}^{S_{\mathrm{M}}^{\circ}} \left( \mathbb{C}[\Sigma_{\mathrm{M}}], \mathbb{C} \right)_{\bullet} \cong A^{\bullet}(\mathrm{M}) $. Our main tool in studying these groups is to recognize them as cohomology of the toric variety associated to the Bergman fan of the matroid. With this geometric approach, we show that these Tor groups fit into a long exact sequence arising from the matroidal flips of Adiprasito, Huh, and Katz, extending the short exact sequence in the case of Chow rings. Using this long exact sequence we give a recursive formula for the Hilbert series of the Tor algebra of a uniform matroid.</description>

      <title>Classes of binary matroids with small lists of excluded induced minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earlier work, we characterized the class of matroids with no $M(C_4)$ as an induced minor and the class of matroids with no member of $\{M(C_4),M(K_4)\}$ as an induced minor. In this paper, for every two matroids in $\{M(C_4),M(K_4\backslash e),M(K_4),F_7\}$, we determine the class of matroids that have neither of the chosen pair as an induced minor. Additionally, we prove structural lemmas toward characterizing the class of matroids that do not contain $M(K_4)$ as an induced minor.</description>

      <title>A Coprime Buratti-Horak-Rosa Conjecture and Grid-Based Linear Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a "Coprime Buratti-Horak-Rosa (BHR) Conjecture": If $L$ is a multiset of size $v-1$ with support contained in $\{1, 2, \ldots, \lfloor v/2 \rfloor\}$ such that $\gcd(v,x) = 1$ for all $x \in L$, then $L$ is realizable. This is a specialization of the well-known BHR Conjecture and it includes Buratti's original conjecture.
  We argue that the most effective route to a resolution of the conjecture when the support has size 3 is to focus on $L = \{1^a, x^b, y^c\}$, where $1&lt;x&lt;y$, with $a$ large subject to $a &lt; x+y$. We use grid-based graphs to construct linear realizations for many such multisets. A partial list of parameter sets that the constructions cover: $a = x+y-1$; $a = x+y-2$ when $x=3$ or $x$ is even; $a \geq 4x-3$ for $x$ odd, $y &gt; 2x-2$, and $b \geq y-2x+2$; $a \geq x$ for $y=tx$, with $x$ and $t$ odd, and $b \geq tx+2t-3$; $a \geq 7$ for $x=3$ and $b \geq y-4$. As well as these (and further) immediate results, the techniques introduced show promise for further development, both to head towards a proof of the conjecture when the support has size 3 and for situations with larger support.
  We also show that if $y &gt; (2x^2 + 2x + 1)/(x-2)$ then the Coprime BHR Conjecture holds for $\{1^a,x^b,y^c\}$ for infinitely many values of $v$, and that there are at most 3 values of $v$ for which it does not hold when $(x,y) = (6,18)$.</description>

      <title>On primality and atomicity of numerical power monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we establish a variation of a recent result by Bienvenu and Geroldinger on the (almost) non-existence of absolute irreducibles in (restricted) power monoids of numerical monoids: we argue the (almost) non-existence of primal elements in the same class of power monoids. The second part of this paper, devoted to the study of the atomic density of $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin}, 0}(\mathbb{N}_0)$, is motivated by work of Shitov, a recent paper by Bienvenu and Geroldinger, and some questions pointed out by Geroldinger and Tringali. In the same, we study atomic density through the lens of the natural partition $\{ \mathcal{A}_{n,k} : k \in \mathbb{N}_0\}$ of $\mathcal{A}_n$, the set of atoms of $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin}, 0}(\mathbb{N}_0)$ with maximum at most $n$: \[ \mathcal{A}_{n,k} = \{A \in \mathcal{A} : \max A \le n \text{ and } |A| = k\} \] for all $n,k \in \mathbb{N}$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of atoms of $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin}, 0}(\mathbb{N}_0)$. We pay special attention to the sequence $(\alpha_{n,k})_{n,k \ge 1}$, where $\alpha_{n,k}$ denote the size of the block $\mathcal{A}_{n,k}$. First, we establish some bounds and provide some asymptotic results for $(\alpha_{n,k})_{n,k \ge 1}$. Then, we take some probabilistic approach to argue that, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the sequence $(\alpha_{n,k})_{k \ge 1}$ is almost unimodal. Finally, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we consider the random variable $X_n : \mathcal{A}_n \to \mathbb{N}_0$ defined by the assignments $X_n : A \mapsto |A|$, whose probability mass function is $\mathbb{P}(X_n=k) = \alpha_{n,k}/| \mathcal{A}_n|$. We conclude proving that, for each $m \in \mathbb{N}$, the sequence of moments $(\mathbb{E}(X_n^m))_{n \ge 1}$ behaves asymptotically as that of a sequence $(\mathbb{E}(Y_n^m))_{n \ge 1}$, where $Y_n$ is a binomially distributed random variable with parameters $n$ and $\frac12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an $n \times n$ array filled with symbols, a transversal is a collection of entries with distinct rows, columns and symbols. In this note we show that if no symbol appears more than $\beta n$ times, the array contains a transversal of size $(1-\beta/4-o(1))n$. In particular, if the array is filled with $n$ symbols, each appearing $n$ times (an equi-$n$ square), we get transversals of size $(3/4-o(1))n$. Moreover, our proof gives a deterministic algorithm with polynomial running time, that finds these transversals.</description>

      <title>Saturated Partial Embeddings of Maximal Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two notions of saturation for partial planar embeddings of maximal planar graphs. Let $G = (V, E) $ be a vertex-labeled maximal planar graph on $ n $ vertices, which by definition has $3n - 6$ edges. We say that a labeled plane graph $H = (V, E')$ with $E' \subseteq E$ is a \emph{labeled plane-saturated subgraph} of $G$ if no edge in $E \setminus E'$ can be added to $H$ in a manner that preserves vertex labels, without introducing a crossing. The \emph{labeled plane-saturation ratio} $lpsr(G)$ is defined as the minimum value of $\frac{e(H)}{e(G)}$ over all such $H$. We establish almost tight bounds for $lpsr(G)$, showing $lpsr(G) \leq \frac{n+7}{3n-6}$ for $n \geq 47$, and constructing a maximal planar graph $G$ with $lpsr(G) \geq \frac{n+2}{3n-6}$ for each $n\ge 5$.
  Dropping vertex labels, a \emph{plane-saturated subgraph} is defined as a plane subgraph $H\subseteq G$ where adding any additional edge to the drawing either introduces a crossing or causes the resulting graph to no longer be a subgraph of $G$. The \emph{plane-saturation ratio} $psr(G)$ is defined as the minimum value of $\frac{E(H)}{E(G)}$ over all such $H$. For all sufficiently large $n$, we demonstrate the existence of a maximal planar graph $G$ with $psr(G) \geq \frac{\frac{3}{2}n - 3}{3n - 6} = \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Permutation clones that preserve relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutation clones generalise permutation groups and clone theory. We investigate permutation clones defined by relations, or equivalently, the automorphism groups of powers of relations. We find many structural results on the lattice of all relationally defined permutation clones on a finite set. We find all relationally defined permutation clones on two element set.
  We show that all maximal borrow closed permutation clones are either relationally defined or cancellatively defined.
  Permutation clones generalise clones to permutations of $A^n$. Emil Je\v{r}\'{a}bek found the dual structure to be weight mappings $A^k\rightarrow M$ to a commutative monoid, generalising relations. We investigate the case when the dual object is precisely a relation, equivalently, that $M={\mathbb B}$, calling these relationally defined permutation clones.
  We determine the number of relationally defined permutation clones on two elements (13).
  We note that many infinite classes of clones collapse when looked at as permutation clones.</description>

Abstract: Klein and Randic (1985) proposed the concept of forcing number, which has an application in chemical resonance theory. Let $G$ be a graph with a perfect matching $M$. The forcing number of $M$ is the smallest cardinality of a subset of $M$ that is contained only in one perfect matching $M$. The maximum forcing number of $G$ is the maximum value of forcing numbers over all perfect matchings of $G$. Kleinerman (2006) obtained that the maximum forcing number of $2n\times 2m$ quadriculated torus is $nm$. By improving Kleinerman's approach, we obtain the maximum forcing numbers of all 4-regular quadriculated graphs on torus except one class.</description>

      <title>Higher order invariants of a graph based on the path sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple and connected graph. A $h$-order invariant of $G$ based on the path sequence is defined from a set of real numbers ${f(x_{0},x_{1},\cdots,x_{h})}$ as $^{h}I_f(G)=\sum\limits_{v_{0}v_{1}v_{2}\cdots v_{h}}f\left(d_{0},d_{1},\cdots,d_{h}\right)$, where the sum runs over all paths $v_{0}v_{1}v_{2}\cdots v_{h}$ of length $h$ and $d_{i}$ is the degree of vertex $v_i$ in $G$. In this paper, we first show that the $h$-order invariant of a starlike tree $S_{n}$ can be determined completely by its branches whose length does not exceed $h$. And then we find conditions on the function $f$ for some graph families $\mathcal{G}$ such that any graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$ can be determined by the higher order invariants $^{h}I_f(G)$ for $0\leqslant h\leqslant \rho$, where $\rho$ is the length of a longest path in $G$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Radius of Graphs with Size Constraints: Resolving a Conjecture of Guiduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to have the Hereditarily Bounded Property $P_{t,r}$ if, for each subgraph $H$ of $G$ containing at least $t$ vertices, the size of $H$ satisfies $|E(H)| \leq t \cdot |V(H)| + r$. In 1996, Guiduli proposed the following problem: If a graph $G$ possesses the property $P_{t,r}$, where $t$ is a positive real number and $r$ is a real number such that $r \geq -\binom{\lfloor t+1 \rfloor}{2}$, does it follow that the spectral radius $\rho(G)$ is upper-bounded by $c(s,t) + \sqrt{\lfloor t \rfloor n}$, where $s = \binom{t+1}{2} + r$? In this paper, we provide an affirmative resolution to Guiduli's problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real matrix is said to be positive if its every entry is positive, and a real square matrix A is algebraically positive if there exists a real polynomial f such that f(A) is a positive matrix. A sign pattern matrix A is said to require a property if all matrices having sign pattern as A have that property. In this paper, we characterize all sign pattern matrices associated with cycle graphs having only negative 2-cycles that require algebraic positivity. We also give some necessary conditions for a sign pattern matrix to require algebraic positivity, and some sufficient conditions for a sign pattern matrix with cycle graph to require algebraic positivity. Finally, we describe all 4-by-4 sign pattern matrices associated with cycle graphs that require algebraic positivity.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal results on the $A_\alpha$-spectral radius of graphs without $K_{a,b}$-minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important theorem about the spectral Tur\'an problem of $K_{a,b}$ was largely developed in separate papers. Recently it was completely resolved by Zhai and Lin [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B 157 (2022) 184-215], which also confirms a conjecture proposed by Tait [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A 166 (2019) 42-58]. Here, the prior work is fully stated, and then generalized with a self-contained proof. The more complete result is then used to better understand the relationship between the $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius and the structure of the corresponding extremal $K_{a,b}$-minor free graph.</description>

      <title>VC-dimensions for set familes between partially ordered set and totally ordered set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say two partial orders on $[n]$ are compatible if there exists a partial order finer than both of them. Under the relation of compatibility, the set of all partial orders $\mathcal{F}$ and the set of all total orders $\mathcal{G}$ on $[n]$ can define a set family on each other by identifying an order as the set of orders that are compatible with it. In this note, we determine the VC-dimension of $\mathcal{G}$ on $\mathcal{F}$ by showing $\operatorname{VC}_{\mathcal{F}}(\mathcal{G}) = \lfloor\frac{n^2}{4}\rfloor$ for $n \ge 4$. We also prove $2(n-3) \le \operatorname{VC}_{\mathcal{G}}(\mathcal{F}) \le n \log_2 n$ for $n \ge 1$.</description>

      <title>On Zarankiewicz's Problem for Intersection Hypergraphs of Geometric Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypergraph Zarankiewicz's problem, introduced by Erd\H{o}s in 1964, asks for the maximum number of hyperedges in an $r$-partite hypergraph with $n$ vertices in each part that does not contain a copy of $K_{t,t,\ldots,t}$. Erd\H{o}s obtained a near optimal bound of $O(n^{r-1/t^{r-1}})$ for general hypergraphs. In recent years, several works obtained improved bounds under various algebraic assumptions -- e.g., if the hypergraph is semialgebraic.
  In this paper we study the problem in a geometric setting -- for $r$-partite intersection hypergraphs of families of geometric objects. Our main results are essentially sharp bounds for families of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and families of pseudo-discs. For axis-parallel boxes, we obtain the sharp bound $O_{d,t}(n^{r-1}(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})^{d-1})$. The best previous bound was larger by a factor of about $(\log n)^{d(2^{r-1}-2)}$. For pseudo-discs, we obtain the bound $O_t(n^{r-1}(\log n)^{r-2})$, which is sharp up to logarithmic factors. As this hypergraph has no algebraic structure, no improvement of Erd\H{o}s' 60-year-old $O(n^{r-1/t^{r-1}})$ bound was known for this setting. Futhermore, even in the special case of discs for which the semialgebraic structure can be used, our result improves the best known result by a factor of $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{\frac{2r-2}{3r-2}})$.
  To obtain our results, we use the recently improved results for the graph Zarankiewicz's problem in the corresponding settings, along with a variety of combinatorial and geometric techniques, including shallow cuttings, biclique covers, transversals, and planarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hypersimplex under the action of the symmetric group $S_n$ by coordinate permutation. We prove that the evaluation of its equivariant $H^*$-polynomial at $1$ is the permutation character of decorated ordered set partitions under the natural action of $S_n$. This verifies a conjecture of Stapledon for the hypersimplex. To prove this result, we give a formula for the coefficients of the $H^*$-polynomial. Additionally, for the $(2,n)$-hypersimplex, we use this formula to show that trivial character need not appear as a direct summand of a coefficient of the $H^*$-polynomial, which gives a family of counterexamples to a different conjecture of Stapledon.</description>

      <title>Hitting cycles through prescribed vertices or edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every set $S$ of vertices of a directed graph $D$, the maximum number of vertices in $S$ contained in a collection of vertex-disjoint cycles in $D$ is at least the minimum size of a set of vertices that hits all cycles containing a vertex of $S$. As a consequence, the directed tree-width of a directed graph is linearly bounded in its cycle-width, which improves the previously known quadratic upper bound.
  We further show that the corresponding statement in bidirected graphs is true and that its edge-variant holds in both undirected and directed graphs, but fails in bidirected graphs. The vertex-version in undirected graphs remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Totally nonnegative matrices, chain enumeration and zeros of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any lower triangular and totally nonnegative matrix whose diagonal entries are all equal to one gives rise to a family real-rooted polynomials. This is used to develop a general theory for proving that chain polynomials of rank uniform posets are real-rooted. The results obtained extend and unify results of the first author, Brenti, Welker and Athanasiadis. In the process we define a notion of $h$-vectors for a large class of posets which generalize the $h$-vectors commonly associated to simplicial and cubical complexes. This answers a question of Alder on defining a $h$-vectors for $q$-posets. A consequence of our methods is a characterization of the convex hull of all characteristic polynomials of hyperplane arrangements of fixed dimension and over a fixed finite field. This may be seen as a refinement of the critical problem of Crapo and Rota.
  We also use the methods developed to answer an open problem posed by Forg\'acs and Tran on the real-rootedness of polynomials arising from certain bivariate rational functions.</description>

      <title>$k$-Adjoint Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the $k$-adjoint arrangements as a generalization of the adjoint of a hyperplane arrangement proposed by Bixby and Coullard, which is associated with rank-$k$ elements in the intersection lattice of a given hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{A}$. The $k$-adjoint of $\mathcal{A}$ induces a decomposition of the Grassmannian, which we call the $\mathcal{A}$-adjoint decomposition. Inspired by the work of Gelfand, Goresky, MacPherson, and Serganova, we generalize the matroid decomposition and refined Schubert decomposition of the Grassmannian from the perspective of $\mathcal{A}$. Furthermore, we prove that these three decompositions are equivalent. A notable application involves providing a combinatorial classification of all the $k$-dimensional restrictions of $\mathcal{A}$. Consequently, we establish the anti-monotonicity property of some combinatorial invariants, such as Whitney numbers of the first kind and the independent numbers.</description>

      <title>Nice Graphical Arrangements Are Chordal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1972, Stanley introduced supersolvable lattices, whose characteristic polynomials can be factored into a product of linear factors. Besides, he showed that a graphical arrangement is supersolvable if and only if the graph is chordal. Terao later discovered that one can define a class of hyperplanes with a ''nice partition'', whose Orlik-Solomon algebra exhibits a desirable tensor decomposition, leading to a factorization of its Poincar\'e polynomial into linear terms. Supersolvable arrangements indeed have such nice partitions. Inspired by these works, this paper proves that in graphical arrangements, chordal graphs, supersolvability, and nice partitions are equivalent. Furthermore, we constructively show that every nice partition of a graphical arrangement arises from a maximal modular chain. In addition, we obtain the converses of two theorems by Orlik and Terao, consistent with the work of Hallam and Sagan on the quotient of a poset.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $L(G)$ be the set of all subgroups of $G$. We introduce a bipartite graph $\mathcal{B}(G)$ on $G$ whose vertex set is the union of two sets $G \times G$ and $L(G)$, and two vertices $(a, b) \in G \times G$ and $H \in L(G)$ are adjacent if $H$ is generated by $a$ and $b$. We establish connections between $\mathcal{B}(G)$ and the generating graph of $G$. We also discuss about various graph parameters such as independence number, domination number, girth, diameter, matching number, clique number, irredundance number, domatic number and minimum size of a vertex cover of $\mathcal{B}(G)$. We obtain relations between $\mathcal{B}(G)$ and certain probabilities associated to finite groups. We also obtain expressions for various topological indices of $\mathcal{B}(G)$. Finally, we realize the structures of $\mathcal{B}(G)$ for the dihedral groups of order $2p$ and $2p^2$ and dicyclic groups of order $4p$ and $4p^2$ (where $p$ is any prime) including certain other small order groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse generating functions for trees and for connected subgraphs on the complete graph, and identify a single scaling profile which applies for both generating functions in a critical window. Our motivation comes from the analysis of the finite-size scaling of lattice trees and lattice animals on a high-dimensional discrete torus, for which we conjecture that the identical profile applies in dimensions $d \ge 8$.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity, slimness, and minsize, on average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be $\delta$-hyperbolic if $d(x,y)+d(z,w)$ is at most $\max(d(x,z)+d(y,w), d(x,w)+d(y,z))$ by $2 \delta$. A geodesic space is $\delta$-slim if every geodesic triangle $\Delta(x,y,z)$ is $\delta$-slim. It is well-established that the notions of $\delta$-slimness, $\delta$-hyperbolicity, $\delta$-thinness and similar concepts are equivalent up to a constant factor. In this paper, we investigate these properties under an average-case framework and reveal a surprising discrepancy: while $\mathbb{E}\delta$-slimness implies $\mathbb{E}\delta$-hyperbolicity, the converse does not hold. Furthermore, similar asymmetries emerge for other definitions when comparing average-case and worst-case formulations of hyperbolicity. We exploit these differences to analyze the random Gaussian distribution in Euclidean space, random $d$-regular graph, and the random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph model, illustrating the implications of these average-case deviations.</description>

Abstract: The article is concerned with the Foulkes characters of wreath products, which are block characters of wreath products, i.e., the positive-definite class functions depending only on the length of its elements. Inspired by the works of Gnedin--Gorin--Kerov and Miller, we introduce two specializations of the Schur--Weyl--Sergeev duality for wreath products and obtain two families of block characters, which provide a decomposition and an alternative construction of the Foulkes characters of wreath products. In particular, we give alternative proofs on some remarkable properties of the Foulkes characters. Along the way, we show that the Foulkes characters are the extreme rays of the cone of the block characters of wreath products and construct the representations with traces being the Foulkes characters via the coinvariant algebra of wreath products.</description>

      <title>On structural connections between sandpile monoids and weighted Leavitt path algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the relations between a sandpile graph, its sandpile monoid and the weighted Leavitt path algebra associated with it. Namely, we show that the lattice of all idempotents of the sandpile monoid $\text{SP}(E)$ of a sandpile graph $E$ is both isomorphic to the lattice of all nonempty saturated hereditary subsets of $E$, the lattice of all order-ideals of $\text{SP}(E)$ and the lattice of all ideals of the weighted Leavitt path algebra $L_{K}(E, \omega)$ generated by vertices. Also, we describe the sandpile group of a sandpile graph $E$ via archimedean classes of $\text{SP}(E)$, and prove that all maximal subgroups of $\text{SP}(E)$ are exactly the Grothendieck groups of these archimedean classes. Finally, we give the structure of the Leavitt path algebra $L_{K}(E)$ of a sandpile graph $E$ via a finite chain of graded ideals being invariant under every graded automorphism of $L_{K}(E)$, and completely describe the structure of $L_{K}(E)$ such that the lattice of all idempotents of $\text{SP}(E)$ is a chain. Consequently, we completely describe the structure of the weighted Leavitt path algebra of a sandpile graph $E$ such that $\text{SP}(E)$ has exactly two idempotents.</description>

      <title>Non-Archimedean GUE corners and Hecke modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint distribution of singular numbers for all principal corners of a Hermitian (resp. alternating) matrix with additive Haar distribution over a non-archimedean local field, the non-archimedean analogue of the GUE (resp. aGUE) corners process. In the alternating case we find that it is a Hall-Littlewood process, explaining -- and recovering as a corollary -- results of Fulman-Kaplan. In the Hermitian case we obtain a `marginal distribution' of a formal Hall-Littlewood process with both positive and negative transition `probabilities'. The proofs relate natural random matrix operations to structural results of Hironaka and Hironaka-Sato on modules over the spherical Hecke algebra, yielding other probabilistic statements of independent interest along the way.</description>

      <title>On low-power error-correcting cooling codes with large distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A low-power error-correcting cooling (LPECC) code was introduced as a coding scheme for communication over a bus by Chee et al. to control the peak temperature, the average power consumption of on-chip buses, and error-correction for the transmitted information, simultaneously. Specifically, an $(n, t, w, e)$-LPECC code is a coding scheme over $n$ wires that avoids state transitions on the $t$ hottest wires and allows at most $w$ state transitions in each transmission, and can correct up to $e$ transmission errors. In this paper, we study the maximum possible size of an $(n, t, w, e)$-LPECC code, denoted by $C(n,t,w,e)$. When $w=e+2$ is large, we establish a general upper bound $C(n,t,w,w-2)\leq \lfloor \binom{n+1}{2}/\binom{w+t}{2}\rfloor$; when $w=e+2=3$, we prove $C(n,t,3,1) \leq \lfloor \frac{n(n+1)}{6(t+1)}\rfloor$. Both bounds are tight for large $n$ satisfying some divisibility conditions. Previously, tight bounds were known only for $w=e+2=3,4$ and $t\leq 2$. In general, when $w=e+d$ is large for a constant $d$, we determine the asymptotic value of $C(n,t,w,w-d)\sim \binom{n}{d}/\binom{w+t}{d}$ as $n$ goes to infinity, which can be extended to $q$-ary codes.</description>

      <title>Gapfree graphs and powers of edge ideals with linear quotients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a gapfree graph and let $I(G)$ be its edge ideal. An open conjecture of Nevo and Peeva states that $I(G)^q$ has a linear resolution for $q\gg 0$. We investigate a stronger conjecture that if $I(G)^q$ has linear quotients for some integer $q$, then $I(G)^{q+1}$ also has linear quotients. We give a partial solution to this conjecture. It is known that if $G$ does not contain a cricket, a diamond, or a $C_4$, then $I(G)^q$ has a linear resolution for $q \geq 2$. We construct a family of gapfree graphs $G$ containing cricket, diamond, $C_4$ and $C_5$ as induced subgraphs of $G$ for which $I(G)^q$ has linear quotients for $q \ge 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the commuting graph of a Rees matrix semigroup over a group and investigate its properties: diameter, clique number, girth, chromatic number and knit degree. The maximum size of a commutative subsemigroup of a Rees matrix semigroup over a group is presented, and its largest commutative subsemigroups are exhibited. We use the knowledge we obtained from the commuting graph of this semigroup construction to deduce results regarding the properties of commuting graphs of completely simple semigroups. We also characterize the graphs that arise as commuting graphs of completely simple semigroups. In the process of obtaining these results we are also able to restrict the possible values for some properties of commuting graphs of groups.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by studies of oscillator networks, we study the spectrum of the join of several normal matrices with constant row sums. We apply our results to compute the characteristic polynomial of the join of several regular graphs. We then use this theorem to study several problems in spectral graph theory. In particular, we provide some simple constructions of Ramanujan graphs and give new proofs for some theorems in the classical book of Cvetkovi\'{c}, Rowlinson, and Slobodan.</description>

      <title>On the Multi-Robber Damage Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Cops and Robbers game on graphs in which the robbers damage the visited vertices, aiming to maximize the number of damaged vertices. For that game with one cop against $s$ robbers a conjecture was made by Carlson, Halloran and Reinhart that the cop can save three vertices from being damaged as soon as the maximum degree of the base graph is at least $\binom{s}{2} + 2$.
  We are able to verify the conjecture and prove that it is tight once we add the assumption that the base graph is triangle free. We also study the game without that assumption, disproving the conjecture in full generality and further attempting to locate the smallest maximum degree of a base graph which guarantees that the cop can save three vertices against $s$ robbers. We show that this number is between $2\binom{s}{2} - 3$ and $2\binom{s}{2} + 1$.
  Furthermore, after the game has been previously studied with one cop and multiple robbers, as well as with one robber and multiple cops, we initiate the study of the game with two cops and two robbers. In the case when the base graph is a cycle we determine the exact number of damaged vertices. Additionally, when the base graph is a path we provide bounds that differ by an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Covers and pseudocovers of symmetric graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of pseudocover, which is a counterpart of cover, for symmetric graphs. The only known example of pseudocovers of symmetric graphs so far was given by Praeger, Zhou and the first-named author a decade ago, which seems technical and hard to extend to obtain more examples. In this paper, we present a criterion for a symmetric extender of a symmetric graph to be a pseudocover, and then apply it to produce various examples of pseudocovers, including (1) with a single exception, each Praeger-Xu's graph is a pseudocover of a wreath graph; (2) each connected tetravalent symmetric graph with vertex stabilizer of size divisible by $32$ has connected pseudocovers.</description>

      <title>The Poincar\'e-extended ab-index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05904v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture concerning Igusa local zeta functions for intersection posets of hyperplane arrangements, we introduce and study the Poincar\'e-extended ab-index, which generalizes both the ab-index and the Poincar\'e polynomial. For posets admitting R-labelings, we give a combinatorial description of the coefficients of the extended ab-index, proving their nonnegativity. In the case of intersection posets of hyperplane arrangements, we prove the above conjecture of the second author and Voll as well as another conjecture of the second author and K\"uhne. We also define the pullback ab-index generalizing the cd-index of face posets for oriented matroids. Our results recover, generalize and unify results from Billera-Ehrenborg-Readdy, Bergeron-Mykytiuk-Sottile-van Willigenburg, Saliola-Thomas, and Ehrenborg. This connection allows us to translate our results into the language of quasisymmetric functions, and-in the special case of symmetric functions-make a conjecture about Schur positivity. A proof of this conjecture now appears an appendix by Ricky Ini Liu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite multiset $A$ of an abelian group $G$, let $\text{FS}(A)$ denote the multiset of the $2^{|A|}$ subset sums of $A$. It is natural to ask to what extent $A$ can be reconstructed from $\text{FS}(A)$. We fully solve this problem for $2$-torsion-free groups $G$ by giving characterizations, both algebraic and combinatorial, of the fibers of $\text{FS}$. Equivalently, we characterize all pairs of multisets $A,B$ with $\text{FS}(A)=\text{FS}(B)$. Our results build on recent work of Ciprietti and the first author.</description>

      <title>On the Ratio of Shannon Numbers of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06155v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a function that maps two arbitrary graphs $G$ and $H$ to a non-negative real number such that $$\alpha(G^{\boxtimes n})\leq \alpha(H^{\boxtimes n})\Gamma(G,H)^n$$ where $n$ is any natural number and $G^{\boxtimes n}$ is the strong product of $G$ with itself $n$ times. We establish the equivalence of two different approaches for finding such a function $\Gamma$. The common solution obtained through either approach is termed ``the relative fractional independence number of a graph $G$ with respect to another graph $H$". We show this function by $\alpha^*(G|H)$ and discuss some of its properties. In particular, we show that $\alpha^*(G|H)\geq \frac{X(G)}{X(H)} \geq \frac{1}{\alpha^*(H|G)},$ where $X(G)$ can be the independence number, the Shannon capacity, the fractional independence number, the Lov\'{a}sz number, or the Schrijver's or Szegedy's variants of the Lov\'{a}sz number of a graph $G$. This inequality is the first explicit non-trivial upper bound on the ratio of the invariants of two arbitrary graphs, as mentioned earlier, which can also be used to obtain upper or lower bounds for these invariants. As explicit applications, we present new upper bounds for the ratio of the Shannon capacity of two Cayley graphs and compute new lower bounds on the Shannon capacity of certain Johnson graphs (yielding the exact value of their Haemers number). Moreover, we show that $\alpha^*(G|H)$ can be used to present a stronger version of the well-known No-Homomorphism Lemma.</description>

Abstract: We define $Z$-signable correspondence assignments on multigraphs, which generalize good correspondence assignments as introduced by Kaul and Mudrock. We introduce an auxiliary digraph that allows us to prove an Alon-Tarsi style theorem for DP-colorings from $Z$-signable correspondence assignments on multigraphs, and apply this theorem to obtain three DP-coloring analogs of the Alon-Tarsi theorem for arbitrary correspondence assignments as corollaries. We illustrate the use of these corollaries for DP-colorings on a restricted class of correspondence assignments on toroidal grids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $r$-graph is an $r$-regular graph with no odd cut of size less than $r$. A well-celebrated result due to Lov\'asz says that for such graphs the linear system $Ax = \textbf{1}$ has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}/2$, where $A$ is the $0,1$ edge to perfect matching incidence matrix. Note that we allow $x$ to have negative entries. In this paper, we present an improved version of Lov\'asz's result, proving that, in fact, there is a solution $x$ with all entries being either integer or $+1/2$ and corresponding to a linearly independent set of perfect matchings. Moreover, the total number of $+1/2$'s is at most $6k$, where $k$ is the number of Petersen bricks in the tight cut decomposition of the graph.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on words and generating Dirichlet series of automatic sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating series are crucial in enumerative combinatorics, analytic combinatorics, and combinatorics on words. Though it might seem at first view that generating Dirichlet series are less used in these fields than ordinary and exponential generating series, there are many notable papers where they play a fundamental role, as can be seen in particular in the work of Flajolet and several of his co-authors. In this paper, we study Dirichlet series of integers with missing digits or blocks of digits in some integer base $b$; i.e., where the summation ranges over the integers whose expansions form some language strictly included in the set of all words over the alphabet $\{0, 1, \dots, b-1\}$ that do not begin with a $0$. We show how to unify and extend results proved by Nathanson in 2021 and by K\"ohler and Spilker in 2009. En route, we encounter several sequences from Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, as well as some famous $b$-automatic sequences or $b$-regular sequences. We also consider a specific sequence that is not $b$-regular.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial $r$-wise agreeing families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of subsets of $[n]$ is $r$-wise agreeing if for any $r$ sets from the family there is an element $x$ that is either contained in all or contained in none of the $r$ sets. The study of such families is motivated by questions in discrete optimization. In this paper, we determine the size of the largest non-trivial $r$-wise agreeing family. This can be seen as a generalization of the classical Brace-Daykin theorem.</description>

      <title>Crossing Numbers of Billiard Curves in the Multidimensional Box via Translation Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The billiard table is modeled as an $n$-dimensional box $[0,a_1]\times [0,a_2]\times \ldots \times [0,a_n] \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, with each side having real-valued lengths $a_i$ that are pairwise commensurable. A ball is launched from the origin in direction $d=(1,1,\ldots,1)$. The ball is reflected if it hits the boundary of the billiard table. It comes to a halt when reaching a corner. We show that the number of intersections of the billiard curve at any given point on the table is either $0$ or a power of $2$. To prove this, we use algebraic and number theoretic tools to establish a bijection between the number of intersections of the billiard curve and the number of satisfying assignments of a specific constraint satisfaction problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the symmetry groups and winding numbers of planar curves obtained as images of weighted sums of exponentials. More generally, we study the image of the complex unit circle under a finite or infinite Laurent series using a particular parametrization of the circle. We generalize various previous results on such sums of exponentials and relate them to other classes of curves present in the literature. Moreover, we consider the evolution under the wave equation of such curves for the case of binomials. Interestingly, our methods provide a unified and systematic way of constructing curves with prescribed properties, such as the number of cusps, the number of intersection points or the winding number.</description>

      <title>Random Tur\'an Problems for Hypergraph Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an $r_0$-uniform hypergraph $F$, we define its $r$-uniform expansion $F^{(r)}$ to be the hypergraph obtained from $F$ by inserting $r-r_0$ distinct vertices into each edge of $F$, and we define $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F^{(r)})$ to be the largest $F^{(r)}$-free subgraph of the random hypergraph $G_{n,p}^r$.
  We initiate the first systematic study of $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F^{(r)})$ for general hypergraphs $F$. Our main result essentially resolves this problem for large $r$ by showing that $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F^{(r)})$ goes through three predictable phases whenever $F$ is Sidorenko and $r$ is sufficiently large, with the behavior of $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F^{(r)})$ being provably more complex whenever $F$ has no Sidorenko expansion. Moreover, our methods unify and generalize almost all previously known results for the random Tur\'an problem for degenerate hypergraphs of uniformity at least 3.</description>

      <title>Deterministic approximate counting of colorings with fewer than $2\Delta$ colors via absence of zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Delta,q\geq 3$ be integers. We prove that there exists $\eta\geq 0.002$ such that if $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$, then there exists an open set $\mathcal{U}\subset \mathbb{C}$ that contains the interval $[0,1]$ such that for each $w\in \mathcal{U}$ and any graph $G=(V,E)$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, the partition function of the anti-ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model evaluated at $w$ does not vanish. This provides a (modest) improvement on a result of Liu, Sinclair, and Srivastava, and breaks the $q=2\Delta$-barrier for this problem.
  As a direct consequence we obtain via Barvinok's interpolation method a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to approximate the number of proper $q$-colorings of graphs of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, provided $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the exploration of a question of dice relabeling posed by Gallian and Rusin: Given $n$ dice, each labeled 1 through $m$, how many ways are there to relabel the dice without changing the frequencies of the possible sums? We answer this question in the case where $n = 2$ and $m$ is a product of three prime numbers. We also explore more general questions. We find a method for decomposing two $m$-sided dice into two dice of different sizes and give some preliminary results on relabeling two dice of different sizes. Finally, we refine a result of the aforementioned authors in the case where m is a prime power.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Bipartiteness vs Bi-Partitioning in Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs are a fundamental concept in graph theory with diverse applications. A graph is bipartite iff it contains no odd cycles, a characteristic that has many implications in diverse fields ranging from matching problems to the construction of complex networks. Another key identifying feature is their Laplacian spectrum as bipartite graphs achieve the maximum possible eigenvalue of graph Laplacian. However, for modeling higher-order connections in complex systems, hypergraphs and simplicial complexes are required due to the limitations of graphs in representing pairwise interactions. In this article, using simple tools from graph theory, we extend the cycle-based characterization from bipartite graphs to those simplicial complexes that achieve the maximum Hodge Laplacian eigenvalue, known as disorientable simplicial complexes. We show that a $N$-dimensional simplicial complex is disorientable if its down dual graph contains no simple odd cycle of distinct edges and no twisted even cycle of distinct edges. Furthermore, we see that in a $N$-simplicial complex without twisting cycles, the fewer the number of (non-branching) simple odd cycles in its down dual graph, the closer is its maximum eigenvalue to the possible maximum eigenvalue of Hodge Laplacian. Similar to the graph case, the absence of odd cycles plays a crucial role in solving the bi-partitioning problem of simplexes in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Given integers $n \geq k \geq d$, let $X_{n,k,d}$ be the moduli space of $n$-tuples of lines $(\ell_1, \dots, \ell_n)$ in $\mathbb{C}^k$ such that $\ell_1 + \cdots + \ell_n$ has dimension $d$. We give a quotient presentation of the torus-equivariant cohomology of $X_{n,k,d}$. The form of this presentation, and in particular the torus parameters appearing therein, will arise from the orbit harmonics method of combinatorial deformation theory.</description>

Abstract: Pandharipande-Thomas theory and Donaldson-Thomas theory (PT and DT) are two branches of enumerative geometry in which particular generating functions arise that count plane-partition-like objects. That these generating functions differ only by a factor of MacMahon's function was proven recursively by Jenne, Webb, and Young using the double dimer model. We bijectivize two special cases of the result by formulating these generating functions using vertex operators and applying a particular type of local involution known as a toggle, first introduced in the form we use by Pak.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture, also known as Frankl's conjecture, asks whether, for any union-closed set family $\mathcal{F}$ with $m$ sets, there is an element that lies in at least $\frac{1}{2}\cdot m$ sets in $\mathcal{F}$. In 2022, Nagel posed a stronger conjecture that within any union-closed family whose ground set size is at least $k$, there are always $k$ elements in the ground set that appear in at least $\frac{1}{2^{k-1}+1}$ proportion of the sets in the family.
  Das and Wu showed that this conjecture is true for $k\geq 3$ and $k=2$ if $|\mathcal{F}|$ is outside a particular range. In this companion paper, we analyse further when $\mathcal{F}$ fails Nagel's conjecture for $k=2$ via linear programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many fundamental problems in extremal combinatorics are equivalent to proving certain polynomial inequalities in graph homomorphism densities. In 2011, a breakthrough result by Hatami and Norine showed that it is undecidable to verify polynomial inequalities in graph homomorphism densities. Recently, Blekherman, Raymond and Wei extended this result by showing that it is also undecidable to determine the validity of polynomial inequalities in homomorphism densities for weighted graphs with edge weights taking real values. These two results resolved a question of Lov\'asz. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the validity of polynomial inequalities in digraph homomorphism densities for tournaments. We prove that the answer to this problem is also undecidable.</description>

Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>

Abstract: Barnette and Edelson have shown that there are finitely many minimal triangulations of a connected compact 2-manifold M. Similar finiteness results are obtained for cellular partial triangulations that satisfy various girth inequality constraints for embedded cycles. A characterisation of various M-embedded sparse graphs is given in terms of the satisfaction of higher genus girth inequalities. With this it is shown that there are finitely many contraction-minimal M-embedded graphs that are (3,6)-tight or (3,3)-tight.</description>

Abstract: A simplicial complex $\Delta$ is a virtually Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex if its associated Stanley-Reisner ring $S$ has a virtual resolution, as defined by Berkesch, Erman, and Smith, of length ${\rm codim}(S)$. We provide a sufficient condition on $\Delta$ to be a virtually Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex. We also introduce virtually shellable simplicial complexes, a generalization of shellable simplicial complexes. Virtually shellable complexes have the property that they are virtually Cohen-Macaulay, generalizing the well-known fact that shellable simplicial complexes are Cohen-Macaulay.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of certain pair state in a quantum network with isomorphic branches, governed by the Heisenberg $XY$ Hamiltonian, depends solely on the local structure, and it remains unaffected even if the global structure is altered. All graphs which enable high-fidelity vertex state transfer can be considered as isomorphic branches of a quantum network to exhibit high-fidelity pair state transfer. The results are used to unveil the existence of pair state transfer in various graphs, including paths, cycles, and others.</description>

      <title>On the MST-ratio: Theoretical Bounds and Complexity of Finding the Maximum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of red and blue points in $\Rspace^d$, the MST-ratio is defined as the total length of the Euclidean minimum spanning trees of the red points and the blue points, divided by the length of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of their union. The maximum MST-ratio of a point set is the maximum MST-ratio over all non-trivial colorings of its points by red and blue. We prove that finding the maximum MST-ratio of a given point set is NP-hard when the dimension is part of the input. Moreover, we present a quadratic-time $3$-approximation algorithm for this problem. As part of the proof, we show that, in any metric space, the maximum MST-ratio is smaller than $3$. Additionally, we study the average MST-ratio over all colorings of a set of $n$ points. We show that this average is always at least $\frac{n-2}{n-1}$, and for $n$ random points uniformly distributed in a $d$-dimensional unit cube, the average tends to $\sqrt[d]{2}$ in expectation as $n$ approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>Sparse Hanson-Wright Inequalities with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive Hanson-Wright inequalities for the quadratic form of a random vector with sparse independent components. Specifically, we consider cases where the components of the random vector are sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables with $\alpha&gt;0$. Our proof relies on a novel combinatorial approach to estimate the moments of the random quadratic form. In addition, we obtain a new Bernstein-type inequality for the sum of independent sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables. We present two applications with the sparse Hanson-Wright inequality: (1) Local law and complete eigenvector delocalization for sparse $\alpha$-subexponential Hermitian random matrices; (2) Concentration of the Euclidean norm for the linear transformation of a sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random vector.</description>

      <title>Paired-domination Problem on Circle and $k$-polygon Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A vertex set $D \subseteq V$ is considered a dominating set of $G$ if every vertex in $V - D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. We called a dominating set $D$ as a paired-dominating set if the subgraph of $G$ induced by $D$ contains a perfect matching. In this paper, we show that determining the minimum paired-dominating set on circle graphs is NP-complete. We further propose an $O(n(\frac{n}{k^2-k})^{2k^2-2k})$-time algorithm for $k$-polygon graphs, a subclass of circle graphs, for finding the minimum paired-dominating set. Moreover, we extend our method to improve the algorithm for finding the minimum dominating set on $k$-polygon graphs in~[\emph{E.S.~Elmallah and L.K.~Stewart, Independence and domination in polygon graphs, Discrete Appl. Math., 1993}] and reduce their time-complexity from $O(n^{4k^2+3})$ to $O(n(\frac{n}{k^2-k})^{2k^2-4k})$.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Core Stability Relaxations in Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study relationships between different relaxed notions of core stability in hedonic games, which are a class of coalition formation games. Our unified approach applies to a newly introduced family of hedonic games, called $\alpha$-hedonic games, which contains previously studied variants such as fractional and additively separable hedonic games. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the maximum factor with which a blocking coalition of a certain size can improve upon an outcome in which no deviating coalition of size at most $q$ exists. Counterintuitively, we show that larger blocking coalitions might sometimes have lower improvement factors. We discuss the tightness conditions of our bound, as well as its implications on the price of anarchy of core relaxations. Our general result has direct implications for several well-studied classes of hedonic games, allowing us to prove two open conjectures by Fanelli et al. (2021) for fractional hedonic games.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. We have studied local changes of the graphs in adding these circles. These graphs are essentially so-called {\it Reeb graphs} of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>

      <title>Some ergodic theorems involving Omega function and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build some ergodic theorems involving function $\Omega$, where $\Omega(n)$ denotes the number of prime factors of a natural number $n$ counted with multiplicities. As a combinatorial application, it is shown that for any $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and every $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ with positive upper Banach density, there are $a,d\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $$a,a+d,\ldots,a+kd,a+\Omega(d)\in A.$$</description>
