      <title>Analog In-Memory Computing Attention Mechanism for Fast and Energy-Efficient Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks, driven by self-attention mechanisms, are core components of foundational and Large Language Models. In generative transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks for long sequences. In this work, we propose a fast and energy-efficient hardware implementation of self-attention using analog in-memory computing based on gain cell memories. Volatile gain cell memories can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation, while performing analog signed weight multiplications to compute the dot-products required for self-attention. We implement Sliding Window Attention, which keeps memory of a finite set of past steps. A charge-to-pulse converter for array readout eliminates the need for analog-to-digital conversion between self-attention stages. Using a co-designed initialization algorithm to adapt pre-trained weights to gain cell non-idealities, we achieve NLP performance comparable to ChatGPT-2 with minimal training iterations, despite hardware constraints. Our end-to-end hardware design includes digital controls, estimating area, latency, and energy. The system reduces attention latency by up to two orders of magnitude and energy consumption by up to five orders compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power sequence generation in Large Language Models.</description>

      <title>Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present a compelling and energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their sparse binary activation. Leveraging the success of the transformer architecture, the spiking transformer architecture is explored to scale up dataset size and performance. However, existing works only consider the spatial self-attention in spiking transformer, neglecting the inherent temporal context across the timesteps. In this work, we introduce Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture designed to integrate spatial and temporal information in self-attention with negligible additional computational load. The STAtten divides the temporal or token index and calculates the self-attention in a cross-manner to effectively incorporate spatial-temporal information. We first verify our spatial-temporal attention mechanism's ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies using sequential datasets. Moreover, we validate our approach through extensive experiments on varied datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101. Notably, our cross-attention mechanism achieves an accuracy of 78.39 % on the ImageNet dataset.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Feature Neural Network for Accurate Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture capable of approximating functions up to machine accuracy. Termed Chebyshev Feature Neural Network (CFNN), the new structure employs Chebyshev functions with learnable frequencies as the first hidden layer, followed by the standard fully connected hidden layers. The learnable frequencies of the Chebyshev layer are initialized with exponential distributions to cover a wide range of frequencies. Combined with a multi-stage training strategy, we demonstrate that this CFNN structure can achieve machine accuracy during training. A comprehensive set of numerical examples for dimensions up to $20$ are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the method.</description>

      <title>Sequencing the Neurome: Towards Scalable Exact Parameter Reconstruction of Black-Box Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the exact parameters of a neural network with only query access is an NP-Hard problem, with few practical existing algorithms. Solutions would have major implications for security, verification, interpretability, and understanding biological networks. The key challenges are the massive parameter space, and complex non-linear relationships between neurons. We resolve these challenges using two insights. First, we observe that almost all networks used in practice are produced by random initialization and first order optimization, an inductive bias that drastically reduces the practical parameter space. Second, we present a novel query generation algorithm that produces maximally informative samples, letting us untangle the non-linear relationships efficiently. We demonstrate reconstruction of a hidden network containing over 1.5 million parameters, and of one 7 layers deep, the largest and deepest reconstructions to date, with max parameter difference less than 0.0001, and illustrate robustness and scalability across a variety of architectures, datasets, and training procedures.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Echo State Networks for Modeling Controllable Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are recurrent neural networks usually employed for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems with relatively ease of training. By incorporating physical laws into the training of ESNs, Physics-Informed ESNs (PI-ESNs) were proposed initially to model chaotic dynamic systems without external inputs. They require less data for training since Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) of the considered system help to regularize the ESN. In this work, the PI-ESN is extended with external inputs to model controllable nonlinear dynamic systems. Additionally, an existing self-adaptive balancing loss method is employed to balance the contributions of the residual regression term and the physics-informed loss term in the total loss function. The experiments with two nonlinear systems modeled by ODEs, the Van der Pol oscillator and the four-tank system, and with one differential-algebraic (DAE) system, an electric submersible pump, revealed that the proposed PI-ESN outperforms the conventional ESN, especially in scenarios with limited data availability, showing that PI-ESNs can regularize an ESN model with external inputs previously trained on just a few datapoints, reducing its overfitting and improving its generalization error (up to 92% relative reduction in the test error). Further experiments demonstrated that the proposed PI-ESN is robust to parametric uncertainties in the ODE equations and that model predictive control using PI-ESN outperforms the one using plain ESN, particularly when training data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Cauchy activation function and XNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a novel activation function, named the Cauchy Activation Function. This function is derived from the Cauchy Integral Theorem in complex analysis and is specifically tailored for problems requiring high precision. This innovation has led to the creation of a new class of neural networks, which we call (Comple)XNet, or simply XNet. We will demonstrate that XNet is particularly effective for high-dimensional challenges such as image classification and solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Our evaluations show that XNet significantly outperforms established benchmarks like MNIST and CIFAR-10 in computer vision, and offers substantial advantages over Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in both low-dimensional and high-dimensional PDE scenarios.</description>

      <title>Zorro: A Flexible and Differentiable Parametric Family of Activation Functions That Extends ReLU and GELU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even in recent neural network architectures such as Transformers and Extended LSTM (xLSTM), and traditional ones like Convolutional Neural Networks, Activation Functions are an integral part of nearly all neural networks. They enable more effective training and capture nonlinear data patterns. More than 400 functions have been proposed over the last 30 years, including fixed or trainable parameters, but only a few are widely used. ReLU is one of the most frequently used, with GELU and Swish variants increasingly appearing. However, ReLU presents non-differentiable points and exploding gradient issues, while testing different parameters of GELU and Swish variants produces varying results, needing more parameters to adapt to datasets and architectures. This article introduces a novel set of activation functions called Zorro, a continuously differentiable and flexible family comprising five main functions fusing ReLU and Sigmoid. Zorro functions are smooth and adaptable, and serve as information gates, aligning with ReLU in the 0-1 range, offering an alternative to ReLU without the need for normalization, neuron death, or gradient explosions. Zorro also approximates functions like Swish, GELU, and DGELU, providing parameters to adjust to different datasets and architectures. We tested it on fully connected, convolutional, and transformer architectures to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>VecLSTM: Trajectory Data Processing and Management for Activity Recognition through LSTM Vectorization and Database Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activity recognition is a challenging task due to the large scale of trajectory data and the need for prompt and efficient processing. Existing methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by employing traditional LSTM architectures, but these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in processing large datasets. In response to this challenge, we propose VecLSTM, a novel framework that enhances the performance and efficiency of LSTM-based neural networks. Unlike conventional approaches, VecLSTM incorporates vectorization layers, leveraging optimized mathematical operations to process input sequences more efficiently. We have implemented VecLSTM and incorporated it into the MySQL database. To evaluate the effectiveness of VecLSTM, we compare its performance against a conventional LSTM model using a dataset comprising 1,467,652 samples with seven unique labels. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art, with VecLSTM achieving a validation accuracy of 85.57\%, a test accuracy of 85.47\%, and a weighted F1-score of 0.86. Furthermore, VecLSTM significantly reduces training time, offering a 26.2\% reduction compared to traditional LSTM models.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary approach for discovering non-Gaussian stochastic dynamical systems based on nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering explicit governing equations of stochastic dynamical systems with both (Gaussian) Brownian noise and (non-Gaussian) L\'evy noise from data is chanllenging due to possible intricate functional forms and the inherent complexity of L\'evy motion. This present research endeavors to develop an evolutionary symbol sparse regression (ESSR) approach to extract non-Gaussian stochastic dynamical systems from sample path data, based on nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas, genetic programming, and sparse regression. More specifically, the genetic programming is employed to generate a diverse array of candidate functions, the sparse regression technique aims at learning the coefficients associated with these candidates, and the nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas serve as the foundation for constructing the fitness measure in genetic programming and the loss function in sparse regression. The efficacy and capabilities of this approach are showcased through its application to several illustrative models. This approach stands out as a potent instrument for deciphering non-Gaussian stochastic dynamics from available datasets, indicating a wide range of applications across different fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present hyper-connections, a simple yet effective method that can serve as an alternative to residual connections. This approach specifically addresses common drawbacks observed in residual connection variants, such as the seesaw effect between gradient vanishing and representation collapse. Theoretically, hyper-connections allow the network to adjust the strength of connections between features at different depths and dynamically rearrange layers. We conduct experiments focusing on the pre-training of large language models, including dense and sparse models, where hyper-connections show significant performance improvements over residual connections. Additional experiments conducted on vision tasks also demonstrate similar improvements. We anticipate that this method will be broadly applicable and beneficial across a wide range of AI problems.</description>

      <title>Counter-Current Learning: A Biologically Plausible Dual Network Approach for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in neural networks, error backpropagation has faced criticism for its lack of biological plausibility, suffering from issues such as the backward locking problem and the weight transport problem. These limitations have motivated researchers to explore more biologically plausible learning algorithms that could potentially shed light on how biological neural systems adapt and learn. Inspired by the counter-current exchange mechanisms observed in biological systems, we propose counter-current learning (CCL), a biologically plausible framework for credit assignment in neural networks. This framework employs a feedforward network to process input data and a feedback network to process targets, with each network enhancing the other through anti-parallel signal propagation. By leveraging the more informative signals from the bottom layer of the feedback network to guide the updates of the top layer of the feedforward network and vice versa, CCL enables the simultaneous transformation of source inputs to target outputs and the dynamic mutual influence of these transformations. Experimental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets using multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks demonstrate that CCL achieves comparable performance to other biologically plausible algorithms while offering a more biologically realistic learning mechanism. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of our approach to an autoencoder task, underscoring its potential for unsupervised representation learning. Our work presents a direction for biologically inspired and plausible learning algorithms, offering an alternative mechanisms of learning and adaptation in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Whole-Graph Representation Learning For the Classification of Signed Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex systems involving structured data and relationships. Consequently, graph representation learning, which aims to automatically learn low-dimensional representations of graphs, has drawn a lot of attention in recent years. The overwhelming majority of existing methods handle unsigned graphs. However, signed graphs appear in an increasing number of application domains to model systems involving two types of opposed relationships. Several authors took an interest in signed graphs and proposed methods for providing vertex-level representations, but only one exists for whole-graph representations, and it can handle only fully connected graphs. In this article, we tackle this issue by proposing two approaches to learning whole-graph representations of general signed graphs. The first is a SG2V, a signed generalization of the whole-graph embedding method Graph2vec that relies on a modification of the Weisfeiler--Lehman relabelling procedure. The second one is WSGCN, a whole-graph generalization of the signed vertex embedding method SGCN that relies on the introduction of master nodes into the GCN. We propose several variants of both these approaches. A bottleneck in the development of whole-graph-oriented methods is the lack of data. We constitute a benchmark composed of three collections of signed graphs with corresponding ground truths. We assess our methods on this benchmark, and our results show that the signed whole-graph methods learn better representations for this task. Overall, the baseline obtains an F-measure score of 58.57, when SG2V and WSGCN reach 73.01 and 81.20, respectively. Our source code and benchmark dataset are both publicly available online.</description>

      <title>"What" x "When" working memory representations using Laplace Neural Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working memory $\unicode{x2013}$ the ability to remember recent events as they recede continuously into the past $\unicode{x2013}$ requires the ability to represent any stimulus at any time delay. This property requires neurons coding working memory to show mixed selectivity, with conjunctive receptive fields (RFs) for stimuli and time, forming a representation of 'what' $\times$ 'when'. We study the properties of such a working memory in simple experiments where a single stimulus must be remembered for a short time. The requirement of conjunctive receptive fields allows the covariance matrix of the network to decouple neatly, allowing an understanding of the low-dimensional dynamics of the population. Different choices of temporal basis functions lead to qualitatively different dynamics. We study a specific choice $\unicode{x2013}$ a Laplace space with exponential basis functions for time coupled to an "Inverse Laplace" space with circumscribed basis functions in time. We refer to this choice with basis functions that evenly tile log time as a Laplace Neural Manifold. Despite the fact that they are related to one another by a linear projection, the Laplace population shows a stable stimulus-specific subspace whereas the Inverse Laplace population shows rotational dynamics. The growth of the rank of the covariance matrix with time depends on the density of the temporal basis set; logarithmic tiling shows good agreement with data. We sketch a continuous attractor CANN that constructs a Laplace Neural Manifold. The attractor in the Laplace space appears as an edge; the attractor for the inverse space appears as a bump. This work provides a map for going from more abstract cognitive models of WM to circuit-level implementation using continuous attractor neural networks, and places constraints on the types of neural dynamics that support working memory.</description>

      <title>Tight Runtime Bounds for Static Unary Unbiased Evolutionary Algorithms on Linear Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a seminal paper in 2013, Witt showed that the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm with standard bit mutation needs time $(1+o(1))n \ln n/p_1$ to find the optimum of any linear function, as long as the probability $p_1$ to flip exactly one bit is $\Theta(1)$. In this paper we investigate how this result generalizes if standard bit mutation is replaced by an arbitrary unbiased mutation operator. This situation is notably different, since the stochastic domination argument used for the lower bound by Witt no longer holds. In particular, starting closer to the optimum is not necessarily an advantage, and OneMax is no longer the easiest function for arbitrary starting positions.
  Nevertheless, we show that Witt's result carries over if $p_1$ is not too small, with different constraints for upper and lower bounds, and if the number of flipped bits has bounded expectation~$\chi$. Notably, this includes some of the heavy-tail mutation operators used in fast genetic algorithms, but not all of them. We also give examples showing that algorithms with unbounded $\chi$ have qualitatively different trajectories close to the optimum.</description>

Abstract: Spiking neural networks and neuromorphic hardware platforms that simulate neuronal dynamics are getting wide attention and are being applied to many relevant problems using Machine Learning. Despite a well-established mathematical foundation for neural dynamics, there exists numerous software and hardware solutions and stacks whose variability makes it difficult to reproduce findings. Here, we establish a common reference frame for computations in digital neuromorphic systems, titled Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation (NIR). NIR defines a set of computational and composable model primitives as hybrid systems combining continuous-time dynamics and discrete events. By abstracting away assumptions around discretization and hardware constraints, NIR faithfully captures the computational model, while bridging differences between the evaluated implementation and the underlying mathematical formalism. NIR supports an unprecedented number of neuromorphic systems, which we demonstrate by reproducing three spiking neural network models of different complexity across 7 neuromorphic simulators and 4 digital hardware platforms. NIR decouples the development of neuromorphic hardware and software, enabling interoperability between platforms and improving accessibility to multiple neuromorphic technologies. We believe that NIR is a key next step in brain-inspired hardware-software co-evolution, enabling research towards the implementation of energy efficient computational principles of nervous systems. NIR is available at neuroir.org</description>

      <title>Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) for solving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) more accurately, robustly and faster</title>

Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions, has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higherorder-ReLU (HR), which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, Bsplines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential to physicsinformed neural networks. We name such KANs with Higher-order-ReLU (HR) as their activations, HRKANs. Our detailed experiments on two famous and representative PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLU-KANs and HRKANs. The codes to replicate our experiments are available at https://github.com/kelvinhkcs/HRKAN.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning and the Emergence of Attributes Associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10763v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In response to an object presentation, supervised learning schemes generally respond with a parsimonious label. Upon a similar presentation we humans respond again with a label, but are flooded, in addition, by a myriad of associations. A significant portion of these consist of the presented object attributes. Contrastive learning is a semi-supervised learning scheme based on the application of identity preserving transformations on the object input representations. It is conjectured in this work that these same applied transformations preserve, in addition to the identity of the presented object, also the identity of its semantically meaningful attributes. The corollary of this is that the output representations of such a contrastive learning scheme contain valuable information not only for the classification of the presented object, but also for the presence or absence decision of any attribute of interest. Simulation results which demonstrate this idea and the feasibility of this conjecture are presented.</description>
