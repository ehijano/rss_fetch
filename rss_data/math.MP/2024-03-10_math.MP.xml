      <title>Fractional diffusion equations interpolate between damping and waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behaviour of the solutions of the time-fractional diffusion equation, based on the Caputo derivative, is studied and its dependence on the fractional exponent is analysed. The time-fractional convection-diffusion equation is also solved and an application to Pennes bioheat model is presented. Generically, a wave-like transport at short times passes over to a diffusion-like behaviour at later times.</description>

      <title>Liouville models of particle-laden flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Langevin (stochastic differential) equations are routinely used to describe particle-laden flows. They predict Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) of a particle's trajectory and velocity, even though experimentally observed dynamics might be highly non-Gaussian. Our Liouville approach overcomes this dichotomy by replacing the Wiener process in the Langevin models with a (small) set of random variables, whose distributions are tuned to match the observed statistics.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Ising models: the Semi-infinite with decaying field and the Random Field Long-range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present results on phase transition for two models: the semi-infinite Ising model with a decaying field, and the long-range Ising model with a random field. We study the semi-infinite Ising model with an external field $h_i = \lambda |i_d|^{-\delta}$, $\lambda$ is the wall influence, and $\delta&gt;0$. This external field decays as it gets further away from the wall. We are able to show that when $\delta&gt;1$ and $\beta &gt; \beta_c(d)$, there exists a critical value $0&lt; \lambda_c:=\lambda_c(\delta,\beta)$ such that, for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$ there is phase transition and for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$ we have uniqueness of the Gibbs state. In addition, when $\delta&lt;1$ we have only one Gibbs state for any positive $\beta$ and $\lambda$. For the model with a random field, we extend the recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in the class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting proposed by Affonso, Bissacot, Endo and Handa, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fr\"ohlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha &gt; d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative proof that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen claimed that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <title>A short proof of a strong Weyl law in dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Dirichlet realization of $-d^2/dx^2-\lambda^2V$ on a bounded interval, with $V$ a positive $C^2$ potential bounded away from $0$ and $\lambda&gt;0$ a large parameter, we prove an asymptotic law for the values $\lambda_n$ of $\lambda$ at the $n^{\text{th}}$ appearance of a new negative eigenvalue. This approximation is correct up to an error of order $1/n$, thus making the result strictly stronger than the classical Weyl law for the number of negative eigenvalues for these operators.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the generalized Yang-Poisson models. We costruct generalizations of the Yang Poisson algebra related to so(1, 5) algebra. The exact realizations of this generalized algebra on canonical phase space are presented and the corresponding differential equations are solved in simple case. Futhermore, we discuss a Poisson algebras related to so(3, 3) and so(2, 4) algebras.</description>

      <title>Generalized Choi-Davis-Jensen's Operator Inequalities and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original Choi-Davis-Jensen's inequality, with its wide-ranging applications in diverse scientific and engineering fields, has motivated researchers to explore generalizations. In this study, we extend Davis-Choi-Jensen's inequality by considering a nonlinear map instead of a normalized linear map and generalize operator convex function to any continuous function defined in a compact region. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem and Kantorovich function are instrumental in formulating and proving generalized Choi-Davis-Jensen's inequalities. Additionally, we present an application of this generalized inequality in the context of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Effective quenched linear response for random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove ``effective'' linear response for certain classes of non-uniformly expanding random dynamical systems which are not necessarily composed in an i.i.d manner. In applications, the results are obtained for base maps with a sufficient amount of mixing. The fact that the rates are effective is then applied to obtain the differentiability of the variance in the CLT as a function of the parameter, as well as the annealed linear response. These two applications are beyond the reach of the linear response obtained in the general case, when all the random variables appearing in the bounds are only tempered. We also provide several wide examples of one-dimensional maps satisfying our conditions, as well as some higher-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Fractional stochastic Landau-Lifshitz Navier-Stokes equations in dimension $d \geq 3$: Existence and (non-)triviality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in $d\ge 3$, driven by the random force $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\theta}{2}}\xi$ which, as we show, corresponds to a fractional version of the Landau-Lifshitz random force in the physics literature. We obtain the existence and uniqueness of martingale solutions on the torus $\mathbb T^d$ for $\theta &gt; \frac{d}{2}$. For $\theta \le 1$ the equation is supercritical and we regularize the problem by introducing a Galerkin approximation and we study the large scale behavior of the truncated model on $\RR^d$. We show that the nonlinear term in the Galerkin approximation vanishes on large scales when $\theta &lt; 1$ and the model converges to the linearized equation. For $\theta = 1$ the nonlinear term gives a nontrivial contribution to the large scale beahvior, and we conjecture that the large scale behavior is given by a linear model with strictly larger effective diffusivity compared to simply dropping the nonlinear term. The effective diffusivity is explicitly given in terms of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Tensor approximation of functional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional Differential Equations (FDEs) play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematical physics, including fluid dynamics (Hopf characteristic functional equation), quantum field theory (Schwinger-Dyson equation), and statistical physics. Despite their significance, computing solutions to FDEs remains a longstanding challenge in mathematical physics. In this paper we address this challenge by introducing new approximation theory and high-performance computational algorithms designed for solving FDEs on tensor manifolds. Our approach involves approximating FDEs using high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), and then solving such high-dimensional PDEs on a low-rank tensor manifold leveraging high-performance parallel tensor algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through its application to the Burgers-Hopf FDE, which governs the characteristic functional of the stochastic solution to the Burgers equation evolving from a random initial state.</description>

      <title>A universal phase-field mixture representation of thermodynamics and shock wave mechanics in porous soft biologic continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuum mixture theory is formulated for large deformations, thermal effects, phase interactions, and degradation of soft biologic tissues. Such tissues consist of one or more solid and fluid phases and can demonstrate nonlinear anisotropic elastic, viscoelastic, thermoelastic, and poroelastic physics. Under extremely large or rapid deformations, for example impact or shock loading, tissues may fracture, tear, or rupture. Mechanisms are encompassed in a universal, thermodynamically consistent formulation that combines the continuum theory of mixtures with phase-field mechanics of fracture. A metric tensor of generalized Finsler space supplies geometric insight on effects rearrangements of microstructure, for example degrading collagen fibers. Governing equations are derived, and energy potentials and kinetic laws posited, for generic soft porous tissues with solid and liquid or gas phases. Shock waves are modeled as singular surfaces; Hugoniot states and shock decay are studied analytically. Suitability of the framework for representing blood, skeletal muscle, and liver is demonstrated. Insight into physics presently unresolved by experiments is obtained.</description>

Abstract: Lie brackets or Lie affgebra structures on several classes of affine spaces of matrices are studied. These include general normalised affine matrices, special normalised affine matrices, anti-symmetric and anti-hermitian normalised affine matrices and special anti-hermitian normalised affine matrices. It is shown that, when retracted to the underlying vector spaces, they correspond to classical matrix Lie algebras: general and special linear, anti-symmetric, anti-hermitian and special anti-hermitian Lie algebras respectively.</description>

      <title>Multirate Time-Integration based on Dynamic ODE Partitioning through Adaptively Refined Meshes for Compressible Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta (P-ERK) schemes by Vermeire et. al. (2019, 2022) to dynamically partitioned systems arising from adaptive mesh refinement. The P-ERK schemes enable multirate time-integration with no changes in the spatial discretization methodology, making them readily implementable in existing codes that employ a method-of-lines approach.
  We show that speedup compared to a range of state of the art Runge-Kutta methods can be realized, despite additional overhead due to the dynamic re-assignment of flagging variables and restricting nonlinear stability properties. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for a range of simulation setups for viscous and inviscid convection-dominated compressible flows for which we provide a reproducibility repository.
  In addition, we perform a thorough investigation of the nonlinear stability properties of the Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes regarding limitations due to the violation of monotonicity properties of the underlying spatial discretization. Furthermore, we present a novel approach for estimating the relevant eigenvalues of large Jacobians required for the optimization of stability polynomials.</description>

      <title>Integrable systems in magnetic fields: the generalized parabolic cylindrical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a contribution to the classification of quadratically integrable systems with vector potentials whose integrals are of the nonstandard, nonseparable type. We focus on generalized parabolic cylindrical case, related to non-subgroup-type coordinates. We find 3 new systems, two with magnetic fields polynomial in Cartesian coordinates and one with unbounded exponential terms. The limit in the parameters of the integrals yields a new parabolic cylindrical system; the limit of vanishing magnetic fields leads to the free motion. This confirms the conjecture that non-subgroup type integrals can be related to separable systems only in a trivial manner.</description>

Abstract: We study a nonlinear partial differential equation that arises when introducing inertial effects in the Kuramoto model. Based on the known theory of degenerate Kolmogorov operators, we prove existence, uniqueness and a priori estimates of the solution to the relevant Cauchy problem. Moreover, a stable numerical operator, which is consistent with the degenerate Kolmogorov operator, is introduced in order to produce numerical solutions. Finally, numerical experiments show how the synchronization phenomena depend on the parameters of the Kuramoto model with inertia.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in equilibrium for a dynamics of rods with random length. This includes the classical hard rod elastic collisions, when rod lengths are constant and equal to a positive value. We prove that in the diffusive space-time scaling, an initial fluctuation of density of particles of velocity $v$, after recentering on its Euler evolution, evolve randomly shifted by a Brownian motion of variance $\mathcal D(v)$.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of crossing probabilities in the dilute Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent paper due to Duminil-Copin and Tassion from 2019 introduces a novel argument for obtaining estimates on horizontal crossing probabilities of the random cluster model, in which a range of four possible behaviors is established. To apply the novel renormalization of crossing probabilities that the authors propose can be studied in other models of interest that are not self-dual, we collect results to formulate vertical and horizontal strip, and renormalization, inequalities for the dilute Potts model, whose measure is obtained from the high temperature expansion of the loop $O(n)$ measure supported over the hexagonal lattice in the presence of two external fields. The dilute Potts model was originally introduced in $1991$ by Nienhuis and is another model that enjoys the RSW box crossing property in the Continuous Critical phase, which is one of the four possible behaviors that the model is shown to enjoy. Through a combination of the Spatial Markov Property (SMP) and Comparison between Boundary Conditions (CBC) of the high-temperature spin measure, four phases of the dilute Potts model can be analyzed, exhibiting a class of boundary conditions upon which the probability of obtaining a horizontal crossing is significantly dependent. The exponential factor that is inserted into the Loop $O(n)$ model to quantify properties of the high-temperature phase is proportional to the summation over all spins, and the number of monochromatically colored triangles over a finite volume, which is in exact correspondence with the parameter of a Boltzmann weight introduced in Nienhuis' 1991 paper detailing extensions of the $q$-state Potts model. Asymptotically, in the infinite volume limit we obtain strip and renormalization inequalities that provide conditions on the RSW constants $1-c$ and $c$.</description>

      <title>Multiple Partition Structures and Harmonic Functions on Branching Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study multiple partition structures which are sequences of probability measures on families of Young diagrams subjected to a consistency condition. The multiple partition structures are generalizations of Kingman's partition structures, and are motivated by a problem of population genetics. They are related to harmonic functions and coherent systems of probability measures on a certain branching graph. The vertices of this graph are multiple Young diagrams (or multiple partitions), and the edges depend on the Jack parameter. Our main result establishes a bijective correspondence between the set of harmonic functions on the graph and probability measures on the generalized Thoma set. The correspondence is determined by a canonical integral representation of harmonic functions. As a consequence we obtain a representation theorem for multiple partition structures.
  We give an example of a multiple partition structure which is expected to be relevant for a model of population genetics for the genetic variation of a sample of gametes from a large population. Namely, we construct a probability measure on the wreath product of a finite group with the symmetric group. The constructed probability measure defines a multiple partition structure which is a generalization of the Ewens partition structure studied by Kingman. We show that this multiple partition structure can be represented in terms of a multiple analogue of the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution called the multiple Poisson-Dirichlet distribution in the paper.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Trajectory and its Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13587v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel approach to investigating entanglement in the context of quantum computing. Our methodology involves analyzing reduced density matrices at different stages of a quantum algorithm's execution and representing the dominant eigenvalue and von Neumann entropy on a graph, creating an "entanglement trajectory." To establish the trajectory's boundaries, we employ random matrix theory. Through the examination of examples such as quantum adiabatic computation, the Grover algorithm, and the Shor algorithm, we demonstrate that the entanglement trajectory remains within the established boundaries, exhibiting unique characteristics for each example. Moreover, we show that these boundaries and features can be extended to trajectories defined by alternative entropy measures. The entanglement trajectory serves as an invariant property of a quantum system, maintaining consistency across varying situations and definitions of entanglement. Numerical simulations accompanying this research are available via open access.</description>

      <title>Features of a spin glass in the random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A longstanding open question in the theory of disordered systems is whether short-range models, such as the random field Ising model or the Edwards-Anderson model, can indeed have the famous properties that characterize mean-field spin glasses at nonzero temperature. This article shows that this is at least partially possible in the case of the random field Ising model. Consider the Ising model on a discrete $d$-dimensional cube under free boundary condition, subjected to a very weak i.i.d. random external field, where the field strength is inversely proportional to the square-root of the number of sites. It turns out that in $d\ge 2$ and at subcritical temperatures, this model has some of the key features of a mean-field spin glass. Namely, (a) the site overlap exhibits one step of replica symmetry breaking, (b) the quenched distribution of the overlap is non-self-averaging, and (c) the overlap has the Parisi ultrametric property. Furthermore, it is shown that for Gaussian disorder, replica symmetry does not break if the field strength is taken to be stronger than the one prescribed above, and non-self-averaging fails if it is weaker, showing that the above order of field strength is the only one that allows all three properties to hold. However, the model does not have two other features of mean-field models. Namely, (a) it does not satisfy the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities, and (b) it has only two pure states instead of many.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Manin triples associated to $n$-Lie bialgebras. We introduce the concept of operad matrices for $n$-Lie bialgebras. In particular, by studying a special case of operad matrices, it leads to the notion of local cocycle $n$-Lie bialgebras. Furthermore, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the double of $n$-Lie bialgebras and Manin triples of $n$-Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze physical spacings between locations of safety rest areas on interstates in the United States. We show normalized safety rest area spacings on major interstates exhibit Wigner surmise statistics, which align with the eigenvalue spacings for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble from random matrix theory as well as the one-dimensional gas interactions via the Coulomb potential. We identify economic and geographic regional traits at the state level that exhibit Poissonian statistics, which become more pronounced with increased geographical obstacles in interstate travel. Other regional filters (e.g., historical or political) produced results that did not diverge substantially from the overall Wigner surmise model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [1] a conjecture for the modular transformation of the free fermion generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE) was given where only the KdV charge associated to the weight four quasi primary field was inserted. In this paper we first generalise this conjecture to the case with an arbitrary, finite collection of KdV charges in the GGE. These GGEs are generalisations of the generating function of power partitions. We prove the conjectured transformation for the case with a finite number of charges inserted and discuss the case with an infinite number of charges.</description>

      <title>Universality of the quantum energy flux at the inner horizon of asymptotically de Sitter black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was found that the energy flux of a free scalar quantum field on a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter spacetime has a quadratic divergence towards the inner horizon of the black hole. Moreover, the leading divergence was found to be state independent as long as the spectral gap of the wave equation on the spacetime is sufficiently large. In this work, we show that the latter result can be extended to all subextremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and subextremal Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes with a positive spectral gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The holomorphic twist provides a powerful framework to study minimally protected sectors in supersymmetric quantum field theories. We investigate the algebraic structure underlying the holomorphic twist of $\mathcal{N} = 1$ superconformal field theories in four dimensions. In particular, in holomorphically twisted theories the flavour and conformal symmetry algebras are enhanced to infinite-dimensional higher Kac Moody and higher Virasoro symmetry algebras respectively. We explicitly compute the binary and ternary $\lambda$-brackets and clarify their relation with the underlying infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra. Doing so we show that the central extensions of said symmetry algebras precisely encode the conformal anomalies $a$ and $c$ as well as the flavour central charges of the physical four-dimensional theory. This parallels the familiar story in two dimensions where the conformal anomaly $c$ is encoded in the central extension of the Virasoro algebra.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation and Asymptotics of Cubically Nonlinear Transverse Magnetic Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Maxwell equations for transverse magnetic (TM) polarized fields support single frequency surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) localized at the interface of a metal and a dielectric. Metals are typically dispersive, i.e. the dielectric function depends on the frequency. We prove the bifurcation of localized SPPs in dispersive media in the presence of a cubic nonlinearity and provide an asymptotic expansion of the solution and the frequency. The problem is reduced to a system of nonlinear differential equations in one spatial dimension by assuming a plane wave dependence in the direction tangential to the (flat) interfaces. The number of interfaces is arbitrary and the nonlinear system is solved in a subspace of functions with the $H^1$-Sobolev regularity in each material layer. The corresponding linear system is an operator pencil in the frequency parameter due to the material dispersion. Because of the TM-polarization the problem cannot be reduced to a scalar equation.
  The studied bifurcation occurs at a simple isolated eigenvalue of the pencil. For geometries consisting of two or three homogeneous layers we provide explicit conditions on the existence of eigenvalues and on their simpleness and isolatedness. Real frequencies are shown to exist in the nonlinear setting in the case of PT-symmetric materials. We also apply a finite difference numerical method to the nonlinear system and compute bifurcating curves.</description>

      <title>Field theory expansions of string theory amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by quantum field theory (QFT) considerations, we present new representations of the Euler-Beta function and tree-level string theory amplitudes using a new two-channel, local, crossing symmetric dispersion relation. Unlike standard series representations, the new ones are analytic everywhere except at the poles, sum over poles in all channels and include contact interactions, in the spirit of QFT. This enables us to consider mass-level truncation, which preserves all the features of the original amplitudes. By starting with such expansions for generalized Euler-Beta functions and demanding QFT like features, we single out the open superstring amplitude. We demonstrate the difficulty in deforming away from the string amplitude and show that a class of such deformations can be potentially interesting when there is level truncation. Our considerations also lead to new QFT-inspired, parametric representations of the Zeta function and $\pi$, which show fast convergence.</description>

      <title>First-principles construction of symmetry-informed quantum metrologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but exact solutions are often hard to find. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of exactly solvable optimisation equations. For any quantity isomorphic to a location parameter, rules to devise optimal measurements are given in closed form. These are valid for any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. This framework unifies the metrology of locations, scales, and other parameter types such as relative weights, for which hyperbolic errors are required. But the central advantage lies on its simplifying power: searching for good strategies amounts to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant, irrespective of error bounds. This reduces the number of calculations needed in practice and enables the rigorous application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.</description>

      <title>Isles of regularity in a sea of chaos amid the gravitational three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem (3BP) poses a longstanding challenge in physics and celestial mechanics. Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can significantly impact estimates of coalescence efficiency and detectable eccentricity.</description>
