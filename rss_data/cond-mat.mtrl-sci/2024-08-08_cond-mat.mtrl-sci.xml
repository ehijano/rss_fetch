      <title>Performance Classification and Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Lithium Batteries Using Machine Learning and Early Cycle Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presents an approach for early cycle classification of lithium-ion batteries into high and low-performing categories, coupled with the prediction of their remaining useful life (RUL) using a linear lasso technique. Traditional methods often rely on extensive cycling and the measurement of a large number of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) frequencies to assess battery performance, which can be time and resource consuming. In this study, we propose a methodology that leverages specific EIS frequencies to achieve accurate classification and RUL prediction within the first few cycles of battery operation. Notably, given only the 20 kHz impedance response, our support vector machine (SVM) model classifies batteries with 100\% accuracy. Additionally, our findings reveal that battery performance classification is frequency agnostic within the high frequency ($&lt;20$ kHz) to low-frequency (32 mHz) range. Our model also demonstrates accurate RUL predictions with $R^2&gt;0.96$ based on the out of phase impedance response at a single high (20 kHz) and a single mid-frequency (8.8 Hz), in conjunction with temperature data. This research underscores the significance of the mid-frequency impedance response as merely one among several crucial features in determining battery performance, thereby broadening the understanding of factors influencing battery behavior.</description>

      <title>Activated Spin Resonance with THz Attempt Frequency in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation techniques are used commonly to characterize non-equilibrium phenomena such as freezing in spin glass and domain wall motion in ferromagnets. Here we investigate the unusual re-entrant ferromagnetic state in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ using ac-susceptibility in the frequency range 0.1 Hz - 1 kHz. Surprisingly, we find Debye-like relaxation with an energy barrier $E_B \approx 840$ $k_B$ and attempt frequencies in the THz range. We discuss the origin of this resonance and, in particular, the implication for single-spin resonance of Sm spins.</description>

      <title>Autonomous, Self-driving Multi-Step Growth of Semiconductor Heterostructures Guided by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03508v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks by closed-loop, autonomous experimentation which enables accelerated optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in automated process with minimal human intervention. In this work, we develop SemiEpi, a self-driving automation platform capable of executing molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth with multi-steps, continuous in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard hardware, homemade software, curve fitting, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi operates autonomously, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes to achieve optimal outcomes. The platform actively learns from previous experimental results, identifying favorable conditions and proposing new experiments to achieve the desired results. We standardize and optimize growth for InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of ML-guided multi-step growth. A temperature calibration was implemented to get the initial growth condition, and fine control of the process was executed using ML. Leveraging RHEED movies acquired during the growth, SemiEpi successfully identified and optimized a novel route for multi-step heterostructure growth. This work demonstrates the capabilities of closed-loop, ML-guided systems in addressing challenges in multi-step growth for any device. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Our strategy facilitates the development of a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Global Minimum Structure of the Pt5V Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the most stable structures of Pt5V clusters are investigated using the successive growth algorithm (SCG) in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The resulting structures are evaluated by various functionals, including GGA (PBE), meta-GGA (TPSS) and hybrid (B3PW91, PBE0, PBEh-3c, M06-L), in conjunction with the Def2TZVP basis set. The results based on these functionals show that two different structures compete for the global minimum. The structural and electronic properties of the two most stable structures are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction activity of nitrogen deficient $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the catalytic performance of a $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dot aimed at enhancing electrochemical water splitting, using the first-principles density functional theory. The size of the considered quantum dot lies within the range reported experimentally (2nm - 4nm) [Zhou et al. ACS Nano 9, 12480 (2015)]. The nitrogen vacancies are created in the considered $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ structure to simulate the realistic scenario, as the presence of nitrogen and carbon defects are reported in the synthesized $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dots. First, the structural and vibrational properties are computed to ensure the stability of the nitrogen deficient $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dots, and subsequently, their electronic and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties are investigated. The calculate HER parameters, i.e., adsorption energies, Gibbs free energies, and overpotentials demonstrate that the considered $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dot with nitrogen vacancies can be used as a moderately effective electrocatalyst for HER performance. We also considered the quantum dot to be dissolved in water and ethanol, and find that the overpotential gets drastically reduced to 16 mV for the alcohol dissolved quantum dot, while some significant reduction is seen for the aqueous solution also. As a result, this study suggests that the nitrogen-deficient $hg-C_{3}N_{4}$ quantum dots dissolved in ethanol are excellent candidates for catalysis aimed at sustainable hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting.</description>

      <title>Machine learning supported annealing for prediction of grand canonical crystal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Factorization Machines with Quantum Annealing (FMQA) to address the crystal structure problem (CSP) in materials science. FMQA is a black-box optimization algorithm that combines machine learning with annealing machines to find samples to a black-box function that minimize a given loss. The CSP involves determining the optimal arrangement of atoms in a material based on its chemical composition, a critical challenge in materials science. We explore FMQA's ability to efficiently sample optimal crystal configurations by setting the loss function to the energy of the crystal configuration as given by a predefined interatomic potential. Further we investigate how well the energies of the various metastable configurations, or local minima of the potential, are learned by the algorithm. Our investigation reveals FMQA's potential in quick ground state sampling and in recovering relational order between local minima.</description>

      <title>Look What You Made Me Glue: SEMGluTM Enabled Alternative Cryogenic Sample Preparation Process for Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive efforts over the past number of years have been applied to develop workflows for sample preparation of specimens for atom probe tomography at cryogenic temperatures. This is primarily due to the difficulty involved in preparing site specific lift out samples at cryogenic temperatures without the assistance of the gas injection system (GIS) as using it under cryogenic conditions leads to nonuniform and difficult to control deposition. Building on the efforts of previously developed GIS free workflows utilising redeposition techniques, this work provides an alternative approach using SEMGluTM, which is an electron beam curing adhesive that remains usable at cryogenic temperatures, to both lift out cryogenically frozen samples, and mount these samples to Si microarray posts for subsequent redeposition welding. This approach is applicable for a full cryogenic workflow but is particularly useful for non-fully cryogenic workflows such as beam sensitive samples, samples that mill easily, and samples with challenging geometries. We demonstrate atom probe analysis of silicon samples in both laser pulsing and voltage mode prepared using this workflow, with comparable analytical performance to a pre-sharpened microtip coupon. An application-based example which directly benefits from this approach, correlative Liquid Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy and cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography sample preparation, is also shown.</description>

      <title>Generation of Weyl points and a nodal line by magnetization reorientation in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnets exhibit fascinating properties like topologically protected surface states or anomalous transport phenomena. While these properties can be significantly altered by manipulating the magnetic state, the experimental verification of such predictions remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the efficient magnetic field control of the Weyl semimetallic state of the collinear ferromagnet Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ by magneto-optical spectroscopy. We resolve a redshift of the nodal loop resonance as the magnetization is rotated into the kagome plane by the magnetic field. Our material-specific theory, capturing the observed field-induced spectral reconstruction, shows the creation of 26 Weyl points for one in-plane magnetization direction and predicts the emergence of a gapless nodal loop for the orthogonal in-plane magnetization orientation. These findings demonstrate that while topological band structures are generally considered robust, breaking underlying crystal symmetries with external fields provides an efficient way to manipulate them, even in collinear magnets. This approach opens exciting avenues to control band topology also in materials with more complex magnetic structures and even to study the interplay of real- and momentum-space topological states, e.g. in skyrmion-lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of mechanical strength in a nanocrystalline CoCrNi concentrated alloy by nitrogen alloying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical performance and microstructures of a CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy (MEA) and NCoCrNi, alloyed with 0.5at% N, after high pressure torsion (HPT) and subsequent annealing treatments in a temperature range of 150-1000 {\deg}C were investigated. The introduction of N results in a reduction of grain size by 40% and ~10-15% increased hardness and bending strength after HPT. Both materials showed strain hardening and plasticity after HPT even at these strength levels over 1500 MPa which is induced by the saturated nanocrystalline state. Annealing at intermediate temperatures of 300-500 {\deg}C resulted in an additional increase of hardness and strength by ~20-40%, compared to the HPT deformed state. This effect was ~10 % more pronounced in the nitrogen alloyed CoCrNi that also showed better thermal stability. However, the increase in strength after 500 {\deg}C annealing was accompanied by a drastic loss of ductility in both materials.</description>

      <title>On electrical transport and thermoelectric performance in half-Heusler phase ScNiSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03639v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-Heusler phases are among the most extensively studied thermoelectic materials. Bipolar thermal conductivity analysis performed for their sub-group based on rare-earth (R) metals, RNiSb, indicated on high mobility ratio in favor of electrons. The suggestion found its experimental verification and led to significant improvement of thermoelectric properties in $n$-type doped series ScNiSb$_{1-x}$Te$_x$. Recently, an alternative interpretation of transport properties in ScNiSb was proposed, where multi-parameter fit lead to mobility ratio in favor of holes. In this work we discuss the details of electrical properties and thermoelectric performance of ScNiSb in context of structural disorder. The article considers also relevant assumptions regarding band degeneracy and scattering mechanisms for effective mass modeling in ScNiSb. Lastly, technical difficulties of the model proposed by the others are addressed. We believe, that the provided insight will be useful for understating electrical transport in half-Heusler compounds, which can contribute to further improvement of their thermoelectric performance.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Thermophotonic Charge Density Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-order states of broken symmetry, such as charge density wave (CDW), are able to induce exceptional physical properties, however, the precise understanding of the underlying physics is still elusive. Here, we combine fluctuational electrodynamics and density functional theory to reveal an unconventional thermophotonic effect in CDW-bearing TiSe$_2$, referred to as thermophotonic-CDW ($tp$-CDW). The interplay of plasmon polariton and CDW electron excitations give rise to an anomalous negative temperature dependency in thermal photons transport, offering an intuitive fingerprint for a transformation of the electron order. Additionally, the demonstrated nontrivial features of $tp$-CDW transition hold promise for a controllable manipulation of heat flow, which could be extensively utilized in various fields such as thermal science and electron dynamics, as well as in next-generation energy devices.</description>

      <title>Lift-off free catalyst for metal assisted chemical etching of silicon in vapour phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-assisted chemical etching of silicon is a promising method for fabricating nanostructures with a high aspect ratio. To define a pattern for the catalyst, lift-off processes are commonly used. The lift-off step however is often a process bottle neck due to low yield, especially for smaller structures. To bypass the lift-off process, other methods such as electroplating can be utilized. In this paper, we suggest an electroplated bi-layer catalyst for vapour phase metal-assisted chemical etching as an alternative to the commonly utilised lift-off process. Samples were successfully etched in vapour, and resulting structures had feature sizes down to 10 nm.</description>

      <title>Giant Uniaxial Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy in SmCrGe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy is a crucial characteristic for enhancing spintronic device performance. The synthesis of SmCrGe$_3$ single crystals through a high-temperature solution method has led to the determination of uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Phase verification was achieved using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), powder, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Electrical transport and specific heat measurements indicate a Curie temperature ($T_C$) of approximately 160 K, while magnetization measurements were utilized to determine the anisotropy fields and constants. Curie-Weiss fitting applied to magnetization data suggests the contribution of both Sm and Cr in the paramagnetic phase. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations explored the electronic structures and magnetic properties of SmCrGe$_3$, revealing a significant easy-axis single-ion Sm magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 16 meV/f.u.. Based on the magnetization measurements, easy-axis magnetocrystalline anisotropy at 20 K is 13 meV/f.u..</description>

      <title>Dynamical manipulation of polar topologies from acoustic phonon pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the recent discovery of polar topologies, a recurrent question has been in the way to remotely tune them. Many efforts have focused on the pumping of polar optical phonons from optical methods but with limited success, as only switching between specific phases has been achieved so far. Additionally, the correlation between optical pulse characteristics and the resulting phase remains poorly understood. Here, we propose an alternative approach and demonstrate the deterministic and dynamical tailoring of polar topologies using instead acoustic phonon pumping. Our second-principles simulations reveal that by pumping specific longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons, various topological textures can be induced in materials like BaTiO$_\mathrm{3}$ or PbTiO$_\mathrm{3}$. This method leverages the strong coupling between polarization and strain in these materials, enabling predictable and dynamical control of polar patterns. Our findings open up an alternative possibility for the manipulation of polar textures, inaugurating a promising research direction.</description>

      <title>Understanding the transport behaviour of PbSe: A combined experimental and computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03786v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead chalcogenides are the promising thermoelectric (TE) materials having narrow band gap. The present work investigates the TE behaviour of PbSe in the temperature range 300-500 K. The transport properties of the sample have been studied using the Abinit and BoltzTrap code. The experimentally observed value of \textit{S} at 300 and 500 K is found to be $\sim$ 198 and 266 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$, respectively. The rate of increase in \emph{S} from 300 to 460 (460 to 500) K is found to be $\sim$ 0.4 (0.09). The temperature dependent electrical conductivity \textit{($\sigma$)} shows the increasing trend, with values of $\sim $ 0.35 $\times $ 10$^{3}$ and $\sim$ 0.58 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ $\Omega$$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$ at 300 and 500 K, respectively. Further, the value of thermal conductivity \textit{($\kappa$)} at 300 (500) K is found to be 0.74 (1.07) W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. The value of \textit{$\kappa$} is found to be increasing upto 460 K and then starts decreasing. The dispersion plot indicates that PbSe is a direct band gap semiconductor with band gap value of 0.16 (0.27) eV considering spin-orbit coupling (without SOC). The partial density of states (PDOS) plot shows that Pb 6p and Se 4p states have a major contribution in the transport properties. The observed and calculated values of \textit{S} gives a good match for SOC case. The calculated \textit{$\sigma$} and electronic part of thermal conductivity (\textit{$\kappa{_e}$}) gives good match with the experimental data. The maximum power factor (PF) value of $\sim$ 4.3 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ W/mK$^{2}$ is observed at 500 K. This work helps in understanding the TE behaviour of PbSe through a novel and insightful alliance of experimental measurements and DFT approach.</description>

      <title>Simplifying FFT-based methods for mechanics with automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) methods have been widely used in solid mechanics to address complex homogenization problems. However, current FFT-based methods face challenges that limit their applicability to intricate material models or complex mechanical problems. These challenges include the manual implementation of constitutive laws and the use of computationally expensive and complex algorithms to couple microscale mechanisms to macroscale material behavior. Here, we incorporate automatic differentiation (AD) within the FFT framework to mitigate these challenges. We demonstrate that AD-enhanced FFT-based methods can derive stress and tangent stiffness directly from energy density functionals, facilitating the extension of FFT-based methods to more intricate material models. Additionally, AD simplifies the calculation of homogenized tangent stiffness for microstructures with complex architectures and constitutive properties. This enhancement renders current FFT-based methods more modular, enabling them to tackle homogenization in complex multiscale systems, especially those involving multiphysics processes. Our work will simplify the numerical implementation of FFT-based methods for complex solid mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Paramagnetic fluctuations of the magnetocaloric compound MnFe$_4$Si$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering technique is employed to investigate the paramagnetic spin dynamics in a single crystalline sample of the magnetocaloric compound MnFe$_4$Si$_3$. In the investigated temperature range, 1.033$\times T_{C}$ to 1.5$\times T_{C}$, where $T_C$ is the Curie temperature, the spin fluctuations are well described by the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model predictions. Apart from the Heisenberg exchange, additional pseudo-dipolar interactions manifest through a finite long-wavelength relaxation rate that vanishes at the transition temperature ($T_C = 305$\,K). Based on the characteristic extend of spin fluctuations in wave-vector and energy space we determine that the nature of magnetism in MnFe$_4$Si$_3$ is localized above room temperature. This contrasts with the most celebrated Mn and Fe based magnetocaloric materials that are considered as itinerant magnets.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty of DFT calculated mechanical and structural properties of solids due to incompatibility of pseudopotentials and exchange-correlation functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for pseudopotentials constructed for a given exchange-correlation (XC) functional far exceeds the supply, necessitating the use of those commonly available. The number of XC functionals currently available is in the hundreds, if not thousands, and the majority of pseudopotentials have been generated for the LDA and PBE. The objective of this study is to identify the error in the determination of the mechanical and structural properties (lattice constant, cohesive energy, elastic constants, and bulk modulus) of crystals calculated by DFT with such inconsistency. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the performance of popular XC functionals (LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN) for these calculations in a consistent manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a longitudinal electrical conductivity calculation method for disordered alloys applicable from a wide range of density functional theory (DFT) codes based on the first-principles Wannier-based coherent potential approximation (Wannier-CPA). For evaluation of electrical conductivity, we employ two complementary methods; the Kubo-Greenwood formula and numerical analytic continuation of the current-current correlation function. We apply the developed method to Ag-Pd alloys and find that the results obtained by the Wannier-CPA reasonably reproduce previous studies by the well-established CPA implementation based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green's function method (KKR-CPA).</description>

      <title>Enantiomer-Selective Magnetoresistance in Chiral Gold Nanocrystals by Magnetic Control of Surface Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral nanomaterials offer intriguing possibilities for novel electronic and chemical applications. Here, we report the discovery of an enantiomer-selective magnetoresistance effect in chiral gold nanocrystals. Based on precise control of nanocrystal chiral morphology using amino acid-directed synthesis, we demonstrate that an external magnetic field can dramatically modulate resistance in an enantiomer-specific manner. For a given enantiomer, a magnetic field in one direction alters the resistance by over an order of magnitude, while the opposite field direction leaves it unchanged. This asymmetric response reverses for the opposite enantiomer. We attribute this phenomenon to a novel chirality-driven charge trapping mechanism, where the interplay between the chiral nanocrystal morphology and the magnetic field selectively modifies the surface potential. The magnitude and sign of the magnetoresistance can be further tuned by the surface chemistry of the nanocrystal, as demonstrated through sulfide treatment. Our findings reveal a new form of chirality-dependent magnetoresistance, distinct from previously known effects such as chirality-induced spin selectivity and electric magnetochiral anisotropy. The ability to remotely control surface potentials of chiral nanostructures using magnetic fields could enable novel approaches in catalysis, drug delivery, and nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of ~ 10T, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved but can be even enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the helical atomic chains occurring in elemental selenium and tellurium. We postulate a realistic model that includes spin-orbit interaction and show this to be topologically non-trivial, with a topological invariant protected by a crystalline symmetry. We describe the end-states, which are orbitally polarized, with an orbital density modulation strongly peaked at the edge. Furthermore, we propose a simplified model that decomposes into three orbital chains, allowing us to define a topological invariant protected by a crystalline symmetry. We contrast this result with recent observations made for the orbital Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model containing a $p$-orbital zigzag chain.</description>

      <title>Material Hardness Descriptor Derived by Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardness is a materials' property with implications in several industrial fields, including oil and gas, manufacturing, and others. However, the relationship between this macroscale property and atomic (i.e., microscale) properties is unknown and in the last decade several models have unsuccessfully tried to correlate them in a wide range of chemical space. The understanding of such relationship is of fundamental importance for discovery of harder materials with specific characteristics to be employed in a wide range of fields. In this work, we have found a physical descriptor for Vickers hardness using a symbolic-regression artificial-intelligence approach based on compressed sensing. SISSO (Sure Independence Screening plus Sparsifying Operator) is an artificial-intelligence algorithm used for discovering simple and interpretable predictive models. It performs feature selection from up to billions of candidates obtained from several primary features by applying a set of mathematical operators. The resulting sparse SISSO model accurately describes the target property (i.e., Vickers hardness) with minimal complexity. We have considered the experimental values of hardness for binary, ternary, and quaternary transition-metal borides, carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides, carboborides, and boronitrides of 61 materials, on which the fitting was performed. The found descriptor is a non-linear function of the microscopic properties, with the most significant contribution being from a combination of Voigt-averaged bulk modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Reuss-averaged shear modulus. Results of high-throughput screening of 635 candidate materials using the found descriptor suggest the enhancement of material's hardness through mixing with harder yet metastable structures (e.g., metastable VN, TaN, ReN$_2$, Cr$_3$N$_4$, and ZrB$_6$ all exhibit high hardness).</description>

Abstract: $\rm{PtSe_2}$ is a van der Waals material transitioning from an indirect bandgap semiconductor to a semimetal with increasing thickness. Its absorption threshold has been conjectured to originate from interband indirect transitions. By quantitative comparison between broadband ($0.8 - 3.0\,\rm{eV}$) optical absorption of high-quality exfoliated crystals and DFT ab-initio simulations, we prove instead that the optical absorption arises only from direct transitions. This understanding allows us to shed light on the semiconductor to semimetal transition and to explore the effect of stacking and excitons on the optical absorption.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Grain Boundary Shear Coupling Tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration stands as a linchpin process governing microstructural evolution in polycrystalline materials. Over the past decade, the concept of shear coupling, quantified through the shear coupling factor, has transformed our understanding and driven the development of theoretical frameworks for unifying GB behaviors. In this study, we introduced a novel concept of shear coupling strength designed to overcome the limitations of the conventional shear coupling factor, notably its deficiency in conveying "coupling" information. The shear coupling tensor formed by the shear coupling strengths characterizes intrinsic shear coupling properties across diverse GBs and reveals complex dynamics within the GB mobility tensor. The molecular dynamics simulation confirms the symmetry of the GB mobility tensor. This symmetry is inherently built into the shear coupling strength, aligning with an assumption made in previous studies. Additionally, an efficient methodology has been developed for streamlined extraction of both shear coupling and GB mobility tensors from atomistic simulations. This advancement holds the potential to sample GB behavior across extensive datasets, significantly enhancing our ability to predict structure-property relationships within the expansive 5-parameter space of GBs.</description>

      <title>Microwave magnetic excitations in U-type hexaferrite Sr$_4$CoZnFe$_{36}$O$_{60}$ ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave (MW) transmission, absorption, and reflection loss spectra of the ferrimagnetic U-type hexaferrite Sr$_4$CoZnFe$_{36}$O$_{60}$ ceramics were studied from 100 MHz to 35 GHz at temperatures between 10 and 390 K. 9 MW magnetic excitations with anomalous behavior near the ferrimagnetic phase transitions were revealed. They also change under the application of weak bias magnetic field (0 - 700 Oe) at room temperature. 6 pure magnetic modes are assigned to dynamics of the magnetic domain walls and inhomogeneous magnetic structure of the ceramics, to the natural ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and to the higher-frequency magnons. Three modes are considered as the magnetodielectric ones with dominating influence of the magnetic properties on their temperature and field dependences. Presence of the natural FMR in all ferrimagnetic phases proves existence of the non-zero internal magnetization and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Splitting of the FMR into the two components without magnetic bias was observed in the collinear phase and is attributed to a change of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy during the phase transition. The high-frequency FMR component critically slows down to the phase transition. At room temperature, the FMR splitting and essential suppression of the higher-frequency modes was revealed under the weak bias field (300 - 700 Oe). The highly nonlinear MW response and the FMR splitting are caused by the gradual evolution of the polydomain magnetic structure to a monodomain one. The high number of magnetic excitations observed in the MW region confirms the suitability of using hexaferrite Sr$_4$CoZnFe$_{36}$O$_{60}$ ceramics as MW absorbers, shielding materials and highly tunable filters.</description>

Abstract: We present the optical activity induced by the orbital magnetic moment in metals and superconductors using Green's function formalization. We show that an apparent singularity of the optical activity vanishes in the normal state; however, it remains finite in the superconducting state and is related to the superconducting Edelstein effect, ensuring the missing area measurement. Finally, we calculate the optical activity in a model Hamiltonian mimicking doped transition metal dichalcogenides to investigate its characteristic spectrum, and we analyze the Kerr effect to discuss a possibility to observe the optical activity in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phosphorene and its components are highly reactive to oxygen when exposed to ambient conditions due to the presence of lone pairs of electrons on phosphorus atoms. Functionalization serves as a solution to prevent the chemical degradation of these materials. In this paper, we investigate the impact of relatively strong covalent or noncovalent functionalization on phosphorene (monolayer black phosphorus (BP)), few-layer BP, and bulk BP. We use an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian that corresponds to one orbital per site, wherein covalent functionalization is simulated by atomic vacancies, and noncovalent functionalization is simulated by Anderson disorder. We demonstrate that these two types of functionalization act differently on the electronic structure and quantum diffusion, particularly affecting the gap and mobility characteristics, especially with a high degree of functionalization. However, we also show that the mobility gap is not significantly modified by the two types of defect. We also analyze the electron-hole asymmetry that is more important for multilayer and bulk BP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanometric solid solution alloys are utilized in a broad range of fields, including catalysis, energy storage, medical application, and sensor technology. Unfortunately, the synthesis of these alloys becomes increasingly challenging as the disparity between the metal elements grows, due to differences in atomic sizes, melting points, and chemical affinities. This study utilized a data-driven approach incorporating sample balancing enhancement techniques and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms to improve the model's ability to handle imbalanced data, significantly boosting the efficiency of experimental parameter optimization. Building on this enhanced data processing framework, we developed an entropy-engineered synthesis approach specifically designed to produce stable, nanometric copper and cobalt (CuCo) solid solution alloys. Under conditions of -0.425 V (vs. RHE), the CuCo alloy exhibited nearly 100% Faraday efficiency (FE) and a high ammonia production rate of 232.17 mg h-1 mg-1. Stability tests in a simulated industrial environment showed that the catalyst maintained over 80% FE and an ammonia production rate exceeding 170 mg h-1 mg-1 over a testing period of 120 hours, outperforming most reported catalysts. To delve deeper into the synergistic interaction mechanisms between Cu and Co, in situ Raman spectroscopy was utilized for realtime monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further substantiated our findings. These results not only highlight the exceptional catalytic performance of the CuCo alloy but also reflect the effective electronic and energy interactions between the two metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1408.2974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to create self-assembled porous media with highly tunable geometrical properties and permeabilities: We first allow a particle-stabilized emulsion to form from a mixture of two fluids and colloidal particles. Then, either one fluid phase or the particle layer is solidified, which can be achieved by techniques such as polymerization or freezing. Based on computer simulations we demonstrate that modifying only the particle wettability or concentration results in porous structures with a wide range of pore sizes and a permeability that can be varied by up to three orders of magnitude. We then discuss optimization of these properties for self-assembled filters or reactors and conclude that structures based on so-called "bijels" are most suitable candidates.</description>

Abstract: Iron-based superconductors, with the ThCr$_{2}$Si$_{2}$-type tetragonal structure (122 family), due to the iron arsenide/selenide layers exhibit several characteristic electronic properties. For example, multiband character mosty associated with the $d$-orbitals of iron and the quasi-two-dimensional (2D) cylindrical Fermi surface. Moreover, external hydrostatic pressure leads to the isostructural phase transition from the tetragonal to collapsed-tetragonal phase. In this paper, in relation to the iron-based superconductors, we discuss the electronic properties of novel 122-family member RbNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ [Liu H. et al., Phys. Rev. B 106, 094511 (2022)]. We show that the two Fermi pockets exhibit quasi-2D character. Calculation of the surface spectral function for the (001) surface shows that the surface states are realized independently on the surface termination. Additionally, contrary to the iron-based 122 compounds, RbNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ exhibits extraordinary multiple isostructural phase transitions under pressure. Moreover, the Lifshizt transition occurs under external pressure, which results into a strong modification of the shapes of the Fermi pockets.</description>
