      <title>One-dimensional Piecewise Smooth Rational Degree Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of continuous maps characterized by a singularity of order $x^{q/p}$ (with $p,q \in \mathbb{N}$, $p&gt;q$, and $(p,q)=1$) on one side of the discontinuity boundary $\Sigma$ and a linear behaviour on the other side. Such maps arise naturally in the study of grazing bifurcations of hybrid and piecewise flows. In this context the boundary collision of a fixed point of the map with $\Sigma$ then corresponds to a grazing bifurcation of the flow. We will start by studying one-dimensional maps, and the main result of this paper is a classification of all bifurcation scenarios, including: period doubling and robust chaos.</description>

      <title>Monotone Multivalued Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of nonautonomous multivalued semiflows and their associated pullback attractors. For this kind of dynamical systems we are able to characterize the upper and lower bounds of the attractor as complete trajectories belonging to the attractor, so that all the internal dynamics is confined in this region, which can be described as an interval due to the orderly nature of the processes. Thus, we are able to generalize to this framework previous general results in literature for autonomous multivalued flows or nonautonomous differential equations. We apply our results to a partial differential inclusion with a nonautonomous term, also proving the upper semicontinuity dependence of pullback and global attractors when the time dependent term asymptotically converges to an autonomous multivalued term.</description>

      <title>Closed geodesics and the first Betti number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, on any closed manifold of dimension at least two with non-trivial first Betti number, a $C^\infty$ generic Riemannian metric has infinitely many closed geodesics, and indeed closed geodesics of arbitrarily large length. We derive this existence result combining a theorem of Ma\~n\'e together with the following new theorem of independent interest: the existence of minimal closed geodesics, in the sense of Aubry-Mather theory, implies the existence of a transverse homoclinic, and thus of a horseshoe, for the geodesic flow of a suitable $C^\infty$-close Riemannian metric.</description>

      <title>Realization of Anosov Diffeomorphisms on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study area preserving Anosov maps on the two-dimensional torus within a fixed homotopy class. We show that the set of pressure functions for Anosov diffeomorphisms with respect to the geometric potential is equal to the set of pressure functions for the linear Anosov automorphism with respect to H\"{o}lder potentials. We use this result to provide a negative answer to the $C^{1+\alpha}$ version of the question posed by Rodriguez Hertz on whether two homotopic area preserving $C^\infty$ Anosov difeomorphisms whose geometric potentials have identical pressure functions must be $C^\infty$ conjugate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the complex 1-dimensional polynomial vector fields with real coefficients under topological orbital equivalence preserving the separatrices of the pole at infinity. The number of generic strata is determined, and a complete parametrization of these strata is given in terms of a modulus formed by a combinatorial and an analytic part. The bifurcation diagram is described for the degree 4. A realization theorem is proved for any generic modulus.</description>

      <title>Validation of Theoretical Estimation Methods and Maximum Value Distribution Calculation for Parametric Roll Amplitude in Long-Crested Irregular Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric rolling is a parametric excitation phenomenon caused by GM variation in waves. There are a lot of studies of the estimation the conditions, the occurrence, and the amplitude of parametric rolling. On the other hand, there are relatively few cases in which theoretical methods for estimating parametric roll amplitudes in irregular waves have been validated in tank tests. The primary objective of this study is to validate theoretical estimation methods for the parametric roll amplitude in irregular waves and improve their accuracy. First, the probability density functions (PDF) of the parametric roll amplitude obtained from the model ship motion experiment in irregular waves are compared with that obtained from theoretical estimation methods. Second, the method to improve the accuracy of estimation of the roll restoring variation in irregular waves is suggested. Third, the method to estimate the distribution of the maximum amplitude of parametric rolling in irregular waves. As a result, the PDFs of the roll amplitude obtained from the experiments differ from the results of theoretical estimation. After that, by correcting GM variation, the results of theoretical estimation are closer to the experimental results. Moreover, by the theoretical estimation method using the moment equation, the qualitative estimation for the PDF of the maximum roll amplitude is succeeded.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to Compute Orbit Zariski Closure in Affine Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article demonstrates the procedure how to compute the Zariski closure of an orbit by an algebraic action of finitely generated group on the affine plane. First half of the algorithm is about deciding whether given finitely generated group is contained in an algebraic group. For the next half, we compute the totality of the invariant subvarieties for a single triangular automorphism. Then, the computation for the individual generators is applied to compute the orbit Zariski closure for a finitely generated group.</description>

      <title>Examining the impact of forcing function inputs on structural identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For mathematical and experimental ease, models with time varying parameters are often simplified to assume constant parameters. However, this simplification can potentially lead to identifiability issues (lack of uniqueness of parameter estimates). Methods have been developed to algebraically and numerically determine the identifiability of a model, as well as resolve identifiability issues. This specific type of simplification presents an alternate opportunity to instead use this information to resolve the unidentifiability. Given that re-parameterizing, collecting more data, and adding inputs can be potentially costly or impractical, this could present new alternatives.
  We present a method for resolving unidentifiability in a system by introducing a new data stream correlated with a parameter of interest. First, we demonstrate how and when non-constant input data can be introduced into any rational function ODE system without worsening the model identifiability. Then, we prove when these input functions improve structural and potentially also practical identifiability for a given model and relevant data.
  By utilizing pre-existing data streams, these methods can potentially reduce experimental costs, while still answering key questions. By connecting mathematical proofs to application, our framework removes guesswork from when, where, and how researchers can best introduce new data to improve model outcomes.</description>

      <title>Existence of arithmetic degrees for generic orbits and dynamical Lang-Siegel problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of the arithmetic degree for dominant rational self-maps at any point whose orbit is generic. As a corollary, we prove the same existence for \'etale morphisms on quasi-projective varieties and any points on it. We apply the proof of this fact to dynamical Lang-Siegel problem. Namely, we prove that local height function associated with zero-dimensional subscheme grows slowly along orbits of a rational map under reasonable assumption. Also if local height function associated with any proper closed subscheme grows fast on a subset of an orbit of a self-morphism, we prove that such subset has Banach density zero under some assumptions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting sums and products in countable and finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a polynomial ergodic theorem for actions of the affine group of a countable field $K$. As an application, we deduce--via a variant of Furstenberg's correspondence principle--that for fields of characteristic zero, any "large" set $E\subset K$ contains "many" patterns of the form $\{p(x)+y,xy\}$, for every non-constant polynomial $p(x)\in K[x]$.
  Our methods are flexible enough that they allow us to recover analogous density results in the setting of finite fields and, with the aid of a new finitistic variant of Bergelson's "colouring trick", show that for $r\in \mathbb{N}$ fixed, any $r-$colouring of a large enough finite field will contain monochromatic patterns of the form $\{x,p(x)+y,xy\}$.
  In a different direction, we obtain a double ergodic theorem for actions of the affine group of a countable field. An adaptation of the argument for affine actions of finite fields leads to a generalisation of a theorem of Shkredov. Finally, to highlight the utility of the aforementioned finitistic "colouring trick", we provide a conditional, elementary generalisation of Green and Sanders' $\{x,y,x+y,xy\}$ theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $C^r$ $(r=3,\dots,\infty,\omega)$ diffeomorphisms with a generic homoclinic tangency to a hyperbolic periodic point, where this point has at least one complex (non-real) central multiplier and some explicit assumptions on central multipliers are satisfied so that the dynamics near the homoclinic tangency is not effectively one-dimensional. We prove that $C^1$-robust heterodimensional cycles of co-index one appear in any generic two-parameter $C^r$-unfolding of such a tangency. These heterodimensional cycles also have $C^1$-robust homoclinic tangencies.</description>

      <title>Fractional Order Sunflower Equation: Stability, Bifurcation and Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sunflower equation describes the motion of the tip of a plant due to the auxin transportation under the influence of gravity. This work proposes the fractional-order generalization to this delay differential equation. The equation contains two fractional orders and infinitely many equilibrium points. The problem is important because the coefficients in the linearized equation near the equilibrium points are delay-dependent. We provide a detailed stability analysis of each equilibrium point using linearized stability. We find the boundary of the stable region by setting the purely imaginary value to the characteristic root. This gives the conditions for the existence of the critical values of the delay at which the stability properties change. We observed the following bifurcation phenomena: stable for all the delay values, a single stable region in the delayed interval, and a stability switch. We also observed a multi-scroll chaotic attractor for some values of the parameters.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. First, motivated by the nearly-affine blender system found in [LT24], we introduce standard blenders and their variations, and prove their fundamental properties on the generation of $C^1$-robust tangencies. Next, as an application, we show that unfolding a homoclinic tangency to a hyperbolic periodic point can produce uncountably many $C^1$-robust homoclinic tangencies, provided that either this point is involved in a coindex-1 heterodimensional cycle, or the central dynamics near it are not essentially two-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Multi-topic belief formation through bifurcations over signed social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a nonlinear dynamic model of continuous-time multi-dimensional belief formation over signed social networks. Our model accounts for the effects of a structured belief system, self-appraisal, internal biases, and various sources of cognitive dissonance posited by recent theories in social psychology. We prove that agents become opinionated as a consequence of a bifurcation. We analyze how the balance of social network effects in the model controls the nature of the bifurcation and, therefore, the belief-forming limit-set solutions. Our analysis provides constructive conditions on how multi-stable network belief equilibria and belief oscillations emerging at a belief-forming bifurcation depend on the communication network graph and belief system network graph. Our model and analysis provide new theoretical insights on the dynamics of social systems and a new principled framework for designing decentralized decision-making on engineered networks in the presence of structured relationships among alternatives.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e and A. Denjoy. The long-standing problem of generalising these results for the equations of the order $k&gt;1$ (or for the systems of equations) is both important and difficult, requiring an essentially new approach. (See, e.g., an interesting old paper by P. Bohl.)
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying important conditions, which follow from the analogy with the solutions in the case $k=1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1.$</description>

      <title>System identification based on characteristic curves: a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier analysis for first-order nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the sinosoidal output response in power series (SORPS) formalism was presented for system identification and simulation. Based on the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), it establishes a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier series for a first-order nonlinear system [F. J. Gonzalez, Sci. Rep. 13, 1955, (2023)]. However, the system identification procedure discussed there, based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), presents the limitations of requiring a sinusoidal single tone for the dynamical variable and equally spaced time steps for the input-output dataset (DS). These limitations are here addressed by introducing a different approach: we use a power series-based model for system modeling using two hyperparameters $\hat{A}_0$ and $\hat{A}_1$ optimally defined depending on the DS. Overall, this work expands the applicability of the SORPS formalism to arbitrary DSs and represents a groundbreaking contribution for the concept of CCs. The method of CCs is complementary to the commonly used approaches of NARMAX-models and sparse regression techniques, which emphasize the estimation of the individual parameter values of the model. However, the CCs-based methods emphasize the computation of the CCs as a whole, thus presenting the advantages that the system identification is uniquely defined, and that it can be applied for any system without additional algebraic operations. Thus, the parsimonious principle defined by the NARMAX-philosophy is extended from the concept of a model with as few parameters as possible to the concept of finding the lowest model order that correctly describe the input-output DS. This opens up a wide variety of potential applications in vibration analysis, structural dynamics, viscoelastic materials, nonlinear electric circuits, voltammetry techniques, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis.</description>
