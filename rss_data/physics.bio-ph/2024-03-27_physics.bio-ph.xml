      <title>Stability distillation hypothesis for the origin of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The essence of life is a frequency distribution conversion process of molecules accompanied by changes in information. In wet-dry cycling hot springs, RNA of different sequences continuously undergoes polymerization and decomposition reactions, products with stable configurations will accumulate their frequency among all RNA molecules and finally become an important source of DNA coding and non-coding regions in primitive cells. This periodic extreme environmental change narrows the frequency distribution of macromolecules through the distillation process and new potential catalysts are searched. When enough macromolecules are accumulated and reliable reaction pathways are built, phospholipids randomly wrap the macromolecules in the hot springs which I would call it the pioneer pools, and these protocells become parallel calculators of molecule frequency distribution. Through the selective permeability of the cell membrane to different molecular weights and properties, cells with appropriate distribution have more opportunities to absorb small molecule substances and increase its intracellular frequencies of molecules. This will strongly induce the occurrence of macromolecules that can widely catalyze the synthesis of other macromolecules or themselves, such as ribosomes, etc. Rupture and fusion during cell division make all protocells share the same frequency distribution of molecules during the origin of life, thus ensuring that all present cells have very similar genetic materials and protein translation systems. This also suggests that viruses may have originated and evolved together with cells.</description>

      <title>The generic temperature response of large biochemical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems are remarkably susceptible to relatively small temperature changes. The most obvious example is fever, when a modest rise in body temperature of only few Kelvin has strong effects on our immune system and how it fights pathogens. Another very important example is climate change, when even smaller temperature changes lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems. Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it effects large biochemical networks with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a rigorous explanation has not been given yet. Here we use a graph theoretical interpretation of the mean first passage times of a biochemical master equation to give a statistical description. We find that in the limit of large system size and if the network has a bias towards a target state, then the Arrhenius plot is generically quadratic, in excellent agreement with experimental data for developmental times in fly and frog.</description>

      <title>Recent advances on the spherical metal oxides for sustainable degradation of antibiotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the permanent harm to human health and ecosystem balance, antibiotic pollution in water has become an important direction of current environmental governance. Spherical metal oxides (SMOs) have been frequently utilized as effective heterogeneous photocatalysts for the efficient degradation of antibiotics due to the unique properties (e.g., strong light absorption ability, high separation efficiency of photo-generated electron hole pairs, and good catalytic activity). This review will firstly focus on summarizing the rational design and synthesis of SMOs with various tuned microstructures such as hollow, porous shell, yolk shell, core shell, and nanoflowers. These structures can expose more active sites, achieve a higher utilization rate of light, enhance the mass transfer efficiency and improve the effective diffusion of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Secondly, this review will mainly analyze the intrinsic relationship between the structure of SMOs and its photocatalytic property, the ability to generate ROS, and the degradation pathway for antibiotics. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanisms and recent progress of different SMOs catalysts for degrading typical antibiotics are compared in detail. Finally, challenges and prospects of future direction in the development of SMOs for antibiotic degradation are reviewed. It is expected to provide a rational design of SMOs catalysts for efficient photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants.</description>

      <title>Tracing and segmentation of molecular patterns in 3-dimensional cryo-et/em density maps through algorithmic image processing and deep learning-based techniques</title>

Abstract: Understanding the structures of biological macromolecules is highly important as they are closely associated with cellular functionalities. Comprehending the precise organization actin filaments is crucial because they form the dynamic cytoskeleton, which offers structural support to cells and connects the cell's interior with its surroundings. However, determining the precise organization of actin filaments is challenging due to the poor quality of cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) images, which suffer from low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios and the presence of missing wedge, as well as diverse shape characteristics of actin filaments. To address these formidable challenges, the primary component of this dissertation focuses on developing sophisticated computational techniques for tracing actin filaments. In particular, three novel methodologies have been developed: i) BundleTrac, for tracing bundle-like actin filaments found in Stereocilium, ii) Spaghetti Tracer, for tracing filaments that move individually with loosely cohesive movements, and iii) Struwwel Tracer, for tracing randomly orientated actin filaments in the actin network. The second component of the dissertation introduces a convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmentation model to determine the location of protein secondary structures, such as helices and beta-sheets, in medium-resolution (5-10 Angstrom) 3-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images. This methodology later evolved into a tool named DeepSSETracer. The final component of the dissertation presents a novel algorithm, cylindrical fit measure, to estimate image structure match at helix regions in medium-resolution cryo-EM images. Overall, my dissertation has made significant contributions to addressing critical research challenges in structural biology by introducing various computational methods and tools.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The force field is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>

      <title>Active drive towards elastic spinodals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active renewable matter, a distinctive feature of adaptive living materials, can exhibit highly unusual mechanical responses by actively navigating the space of material parameters. In particular, it can self-drive towards elastic spinodals where the presence of inhomogeneous floppy modes, makes the matter elastically degenerate. The main effect of the implied marginality is stress localization leading to the emergence of force chains which can be actively assembled and disassembled. In this Letter we formalize the concept of spinodal states for general elastic solids and show how such extreme mechanical regimes can be actively navigated.</description>

      <title>Controlling the chaotic wake of a flapping foil by tuning its chordwise flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effects of chord-wise flexibility as an instrument to control chaotic transitions in the wake of a flexible flapping foil have been studied here using an immersed boundary method-based in-house fluid-structure-interaction solver. The ability of the flapping foil at an optimum level of flexibility to inhibit chaotic transition, otherwise encountered in a similar but rigid configuration, has been highlighted. The rigid foil manifests chaotic transition through a quasi-periodic-intermittency route at high dynamic plunge velocities; whereas, increasing the level of flexibility gradually regularises the aperiodic behaviour through a variety of interesting wake patterns. If flexibility is increased beyond an optimum level, aperiodicity sets in again and robust chaos is restored at very high flexibility levels. The mechanisms of triggering the order-to-chaos transition are different between the rigid and the high flexibility cases. Along the route to order and back to chaos, the flexible foil exhibits different flow-field behaviours, including far-wake switching, primary \&amp; secondary vortex streets, bifurcated wakes and interactive vortices between the bifurcated wakes. The underlying interaction mechanisms of the flow-field vortices responsible for the associated dynamical signatures of the wake have been closely tracked. This study further examines the optimum propulsive performance range of the flexible flapper and investigates its connection with the periodicity/regularity of the system.</description>

      <title>Shallow learning enables real-time inference of molecular composition from spectroscopy of brain tissue</title>

Abstract: Optical imaging modalities such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) represent a promising alternative for low-cost, non-invasive, and fast monitoring of functional and structural properties of living tissue. Particularly, the possibility of extracting the molecular composition of the tissue from the optical spectra in real-time deems the spectroscopy techniques as a unique diagnostic tool. However, due to a lack of paired optical and molecular profiling studies, building a mapping between a spectral signature and a corresponding set of molecular concentrations is still an unsolved problem. Furthermore, no established methods exist to streamline the inference of the biochemical composition from the optical spectrum for real-time applications such as surgical monitoring. In this paper, we analyse a technique for fast and accurate inference of changes in the molecular composition of brain tissue. We base our method on the Beer-Lambert law to analytically connect the spectra with concentrations and use a deep-learning approach to significantly speed up the concentration inference compared to traditional optimization methods. We test our approach on real data obtained from the broadband NIRS- and HSI-based optical monitoring of brain tissue. The results demonstrate that the proposed method enables real-time molecular composition inference while maintaining the accuracy of traditional linear and non-linear optimization solvers.</description>

      <title>The Nature of the Action Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that our recently developed theory of electric field wave propagation in anisotropic and inhomogeneous brain tissues, which has been shown to explain a broad range of observed coherent synchronous brain electrical processes, also explains the spiking behavior of single neurons, thus bridging the gap between the fundamental element of brain electrical activity (the neuron) and large-scale coherent synchronous electrical activity.
  Our analysis indicates that the membrane interface of the axonal cellular system can be mathematically described by a nonlinear system with several small parameters. This allows for the rigorous derivation of an accurate yet simpler nonlinear model following the formal small parameter expansion. The resulting action potential model exhibits a smooth, continuous transition from the linear wave oscillatory regime to the nonlinear spiking regime, as well as a critical transition to a non-oscillatory regime. These transitions occur with changes in the criticality parameter and include several different bifurcation types, representative of the various experimentally detected neuron types.
  This new theory overcomes the limitations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, such as the inability to explain extracellular spiking, efficient brain synchronization, saltatory conduction along myelinated axons, and a variety of other observed coherent macroscopic brain electrical phenomena. We also show that the standard cable axon theory can be recovered by our approach, using the very crude assumptions of piece-wise homogeneity and isotropy. However, the diffusion process described by the cable equation is not capable of supporting action potential propagation across a wide range of experimentally reported axon parameters.</description>

      <title>Clonal dynamics of surface-driven growing tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-organization of cells into complex tissues relies on a tight coordination of cell behavior. Identifying the cellular processes driving tissue growth is key to understanding the emergence of tissue forms and devising targeted therapies for aberrant growth, such as in cancer. Inferring the mode of tissue growth, whether it is driven by cells on the surface or cells in the bulk, is possible in cell culture experiments, but difficult in most tissues in living organisms (in vivo). Genetic tracing experiments, where a subset of cells is labeled with inheritable markers have become important experimental tools to study cell fate in vivo. Here, we show that the mode of tissue growth is reflected in the size distribution of the progeny of marked cells. To this end, we derive the clone-size distributions using analytical calculations in the limit of negligible cell migration and cell death, and we test our predictions with an agent-based stochastic sampling technique. We show that for surface-driven growth the clone-size distribution takes a characteristic power-law form with an exponent determined by fluctuations of the tissue surface. Our results show how the mode of tissue growth can be inferred from genetic tracing experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patterns on curved surfaces are ubiquitous, yet the influence of surface geometry on pattern dynamics remains elusive. We recently reported a new mechanism of pattern propagation in which a static pattern on a flat plane becomes a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. Here, we address whether surface curvature can drive more complex pattern dynamics beyond propagation. By employing a combination of weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulation, we show that oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics can emerge by controlling the surface shapes. These findings highlight a new role of surface topography in pattern formation and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of Turing pattern dynamics on curved surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pattern dynamics on curved surfaces are ubiquitous. Although the effect of surface topography on pattern dynamics has gained much interest, there is a limited understanding of the roles of surface geometry and topology in pattern dynamics. Recently, we reported that a static pattern on a flat plane can become a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. By examining reaction-diffusion equations on axisymmetric surfaces, certain conditions for the onset of pattern propagation were determined. However, this analysis was limited by the assumption that the pattern propagates at a constant speed. Here, we investigate the pattern propagation driven by surface curvature using weakly nonlinear analysis, which enables a more comprehensive approach to the aforementioned problem. The analysis reveals consistent conditions of the pattern propagation similar to our previous results, and further predicts that rich dynamics other than pattern propagation, such as periodic and chaotic behaviors, can arise depending on the surface geometry. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between surfaces and pattern dynamics and a basis for controlling pattern dynamics on surfaces.</description>
