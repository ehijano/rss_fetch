      <title>Convergence of Recursive Least Squares Based Input/Output System Identification with Model Order Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete-time input/output models, also called infinite impulse response (IIR) models or autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, are useful for online identification as they can be efficiently updated using recursive least squares (RLS) as new data is collected. Several works have studied the convergence of the input/output model coefficients identified using RLS under the assumption that the order of the identified model is the same as that of the true system. However, the case of model order mismatch is not as well addressed. This work begins by introducing the notion of \textit{equivalence} of input/output models of different orders. Next, this work analyzes online identification of input/output models in the case where the order of the identified model is higher than that of the true system. It is shown that, given persistently exciting data, the higher-order identified model converges to the model equivalent to the true system that minimizes the regularization term of RLS.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of the Linear Quadratic Regulator: A Reinforcement Learning Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first known algorithm that provably achieves $\varepsilon$-optimality within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon)$ function evaluations for the discounted discrete-time LQR problem with unknown parameters, without relying on two-point gradient estimates. These estimates are known to be unrealistic in many settings, as they depend on using the exact same initialization, which is to be selected randomly, for two different policies. Our results substantially improve upon the existing literature outside the realm of two-point gradient estimates, which either leads to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ rates or heavily relies on stability assumptions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kalman Filtering Developed from Recursive Least Squares Forgetting Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recursive least squares (RLS) is derived as the recursive minimizer of the least-squares cost function. Moreover, it is well known that RLS is a special case of the Kalman filter. This work presents the Kalman filter least squares (KFLS) cost function, whose recursive minimizer gives the Kalman filter. KFLS is an extension of generalized forgetting recursive least squares (GF-RLS), a general framework which contains various extensions of RLS from the literature as special cases. This then implies that extensions of RLS are also special cases of the Kalman filter. Motivated by this connection, we propose an algorithm that combines extensions of RLS with the Kalman filter, resulting in a new class of adaptive Kalman filters. A numerical example shows that one such adaptive Kalman filter provides improved state estimation for a mass-spring-damper with intermittent, unmodeled collisions. This example suggests that such adaptive Kalman filtering may provide potential benefits for systems with non-classical disturbances.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Actor-Critic for Coordination of Virtual Inertia from Power Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vanishing inertia of synchronous generators in transmission systems requires the utilization of renewables for inertial support. These are often connected to the distribution system and their support should be coordinated to avoid violation of grid limits. To this end, this paper presents the Physics-informed Actor-Critic (PI-AC) algorithm for coordination of Virtual Inertia (VI) from renewable Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) in power distribution systems. Acquiring a model of the distribution grid can be difficult, since certain parts are often unknown or the parameters are highly uncertain. To favor model-free coordination, Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods can be employed, necessitating a substantial level of training beforehand. The PI-AC is a RL algorithm that integrates the physical behavior of the power system into the Actor-Critic (AC) approach in order to achieve faster learning. To this end, we regularize the loss function with an aggregated power system dynamics model based on the swing equation. Throughout this paper, we explore the PI-AC functionality in a case study with the CIGRE 14-bus and IEEE 37-bus power distribution system in various grid settings. The PI-AC is able to achieve better rewards and faster learning than the exclusively data-driven AC algorithm and the metaheuristic Genetic Algorithm (GA).</description>

      <title>Dynamic Phasor Modeling of Single-Phase Grid-Forming Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern power systems, grid-forming power converters (GFMCs) have emerged as an enabling technology. However, the modeling of single-phase GFMCs faces new challenges. In particular, the nonlinear orthogonal signal generation unit, crucial for power measurement, still lacks an accurate model. To overcome the challenges, this letter proposes a dynamic phasor model of single-phase GFMCs. Moreover, we linearize the proposed model and perform stability analysis, which confirm that the proposed model is more accurate than existing models. Experimental results validate the improved accuracy of the proposed dynamic phasor model.</description>

      <title>Vision-based control for landing an aerial vehicle on a marine vessel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the landing problem of an aerial vehicle, exemplified by a simple quadrotor, on a moving platform using image-based visual servo control. First, the mathematical model of the quadrotor aircraft is introduced, followed by the design of the inner-loop control. At the second stage, the image features on the textured target plane are exploited to derive a vision-based control law. The image of the spherical centroid of a set of landmarks present in the landing target is used as a position measurement, whereas the translational optical flow is used as velocity measurement. The kinematics of the vision-based system is expressed in terms of the observable features, and the proposed control law guarantees convergence without estimating the unknown distance between the vision system and the target, which is also guaranteed to remain strictly positive, avoiding undesired collisions. The performance of the proposed control law is evaluated in MATLAB and 3-D simulation software Gazebo. Simulation results for a quadrotor UAV are provided for different velocity profiles of the moving target, showcasing the robustness of the proposed controller.</description>

      <title>Cost-effective company response policy for product co-creation in company-sponsored online community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product co-creation based on company-sponsored online community has come to be a paradigm of developing new products collaboratively with customers. In such a product co-creation campaign, the sponsoring company needs to interact intensively with active community members about the design scheme of the product. We call the collection of the rates of the company's response to active community members at all time in the co-creation campaign as a company response policy (CRP). This paper addresses the problem of finding a cost-effective CRP (the CRP problem). First, we introduce a novel community state evolutionary model and, thereby, establish an optimal control model for the CRP problem (the CRP model). Second, based on the optimality system for the CRP model, we present an iterative algorithm for solving the CRP model (the CRP algorithm). Thirdly, through extensive numerical experiments, we conclude that the CRP algorithm converges and the resulting CRP exhibits excellent cost benefit. Consequently, we recommend the resulting CRP to companies that embrace product co-creation. Next, we discuss how to implement the resulting CRP. Finally, we investigate the effect of some factors on the cost benefit of the resulting CRP. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to study value co-creation through optimal control theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Sustainability of Data Center Digital Twins with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of machine learning (ML) has led to an increased demand for computational power, resulting in larger data centers (DCs) and higher energy consumption. To address this issue and reduce carbon emissions, intelligent design and control of DC components such as IT servers, cabinets, HVAC cooling, flexible load shifting, and battery energy storage are essential. However, the complexity of designing and controlling them in tandem presents a significant challenge. While some individual components like CFD-based design and Reinforcement Learning (RL) based HVAC control have been researched, there's a gap in the holistic design and optimization covering all elements simultaneously. To tackle this, we've developed DCRL-Green, a multi-agent RL environment that empowers the ML community to design data centers and research, develop, and refine RL controllers for carbon footprint reduction in DCs. It is a flexible, modular, scalable, and configurable platform that can handle large High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. Furthermore, in its default setup, DCRL-Green provides a benchmark for evaluating single as well as multi-agent RL algorithms. It easily allows users to subclass the default implementations and design their own control approaches, encouraging community development for sustainable data centers.

      <title>SIFt-RLS: Subspace of Information Forgetting Recursive Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents subspace of information forgetting recursive least squares (SIFt-RLS), a directional forgetting algorithm which, at each step, forgets only in row space of the regressor matrix, or the \textit{information subspace}. As a result, SIFt-RLS tracks parameters that are in excited directions while not changing parameter estimation in unexcited directions. It is shown that SIFt-RLS guarantees an upper and lower bound of the covariance matrix, without assumptions of persistent excitation, and explicit bounds are given. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are given for the uniform Lyapunov stability and global uniform exponential stability of parameter estimation error in SIFt-RLS when estimating fixed parameters without noise. SIFt-RLS is compared to other RLS algorithms from the literature in a numerical example without persistently exciting data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Batch and Recursive Least Squares for Matrix Parameter Estimation with Application to Adaptive MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, batch least squares (BLS) and recursive least squares (RLS) are used for identification of a vector of parameters that form a linear model. In some situations, however, it is of interest to identify parameters in a matrix structure. In this case, a common approach is to transform the problem into standard vector form using the vectorization (vec) operator and the Kronecker product, known as vec-permutation. However, the use of the Kronecker product introduces extraneous zero terms in the regressor, resulting in unnecessary additional computational and space requirements. This work derives matrix BLS and RLS formulations which, under mild assumptions, minimize the same cost as the vec-permutation approach. This new approach requires less computational complexity and space complexity than vec-permutation in both BLS and RLS identification. It is also shown that persistent excitation guarantees convergence to the true matrix parameters. This method can used to improve computation time in the online identification of multiple-input, multiple-output systems for indirect adaptive model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning Controller for Energy from Spread Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The industrial multi-generator Wave Energy Converters (WEC) must handle multiple simultaneous waves coming from different directions called spread waves. These complex devices in challenging circumstances need controllers with multiple objectives of energy capture efficiency, reduction of structural stress to limit maintenance, and proactive protection against high waves. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) controller trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm can handle these complexities. In this paper, we explore different function approximations for the policy and critic networks in modeling the sequential nature of the system dynamics and find that they are key to better performance. We investigated the performance of a fully connected neural network (FCN), LSTM, and Transformer model variants with varying depths and gated residual connections. Our results show that the transformer model of moderate depth with gated residual connections around the multi-head attention, multi-layer perceptron, and the transformer block (STrXL) proposed in this paper is optimal and boosts energy efficiency by an average of 22.1% for these complex spread waves over the existing spring damper (SD) controller. Furthermore, unlike the default SD controller, the transformer controller almost eliminated the mechanical stress from the rotational yaw motion for angled waves.

      <title>Simultaneous compensation of input delay and state/input quantization for linear systems via switched predictor feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a switched predictor-feedback law, which achieves global asymptotic stabilization of linear systems with input delay and with the plant and actuator states available only in (almost) quantized form. The control design relies on a quantized version of the nominal predictor-feedback law for linear systems, in which quantized measurements of the plant and actuator states enter the predictor state formula. A switching strategy is constructed to dynamically adjust the tunable parameter of the quantizer (in a piecewise constant manner), in order to initially increase the range and subsequently decrease the error of the quantizers. The key element in the proof of global asymptotic stability in the supremum norm of the actuator state is derivation of solutions' estimates combining a backstepping transformation with small-gain and input-to-state stability arguments, for addressing the error due to quantization. We extend this result to the input quantization case and illustrate our theory with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Drift Control of High-Dimensional RBM: A Computational Method Based on Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in queueing theory, we consider a stochastic control problem whose state space is the $d$-dimensional positive orthant. The controlled process $Z$ evolves as a reflected Brownian motion whose covariance matrix is exogenously specified, as are its directions of reflection from the orthant's boundary surfaces. A system manager chooses a drift vector $\theta(t)$ at each time $t$ based on the history of $Z$, and the cost rate at time $t$ depends on both $Z(t)$ and $\theta(t)$. In our initial problem formulation, the objective is to minimize expected discounted cost over an infinite planning horizon, after which we treat the corresponding ergodic control problem. Extending earlier work by Han et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2018, 8505-8510), we develop and illustrate a simulation-based computational method that relies heavily on deep neural network technology. For test problems studied thus far, our method is accurate to within a fraction of one percent, and is computationally feasible in dimensions up to at least $d=30$.</description>

      <title>A harmonic framework for the identification of linear time-periodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for the identification of linear time-periodic (LTP) systems in continuous time. This method is based on harmonic modeling and consists in converting any LTP system into an equivalent LTI system with infinite dimension. Leveraging specific harmonic properties, we demonstrate that solving this infinite-dimensional identification problem can be reduced to solving a finitedimensional linear least-squares problem. The result is an approximation of the original solution with an arbitrarily small error. Our approach offers several significant advantages. The first one is closely tied to the harmonic system's inherent LTI characteristic, along with the Toeplitz structure exhibited by its elements. The second advantage is related to the regularization property achieved through the integral action when computing the phasors from input and state trajectories. Finally, our method avoids the computation of signals' derivative. This sets our approach apart from existing methods that rely on such computations, which can be a notable drawback, especially in continuous-time settings. We provide numerical simulations that convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, even in scenarios where signals are corrupted by noise.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by applications in queueing theory, we consider a class of singular stochastic control problems whose state space is the d-dimensional positive orthant. The original problem is approximated by a drift control problem, to which we apply a recently developed computational method that is feasible for dimensions up to d=30 or more. To show that nearly optimal solutions are obtainable using this method, we present computational results for a variety of examples, including queueing network examples that have appeared previously in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Media streaming is the dominant application over wireless edge (access) networks. The increasing softwarization of such networks has led to efforts at intelligent control, wherein application-specific actions may be dynamically taken to enhance the user experience. The goal of this work is to develop and demonstrate learning-based policies for optimal decision making to determine which clients to dynamically prioritize in a video streaming setting. We formulate the policy design question as a constrained Markov decision problem (CMDP), and observe that by using a Lagrangian relaxation we can decompose it into single-client problems. Further, the optimal policy takes a threshold form in the video buffer length, which enables us to design an efficient constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm to learn it. Specifically, we show that a natural policy gradient (NPG) based algorithm that is derived using the structure of our problem converges to the globally optimal policy. We then develop a simulation environment for training, and a real-world intelligent controller attached to a WiFi access point for evaluation. We empirically show that the structured learning approach enables fast learning. Furthermore, such a structured policy can be easily deployed due to low computational complexity, leading to policy execution taking only about 15$\mu$s. Using YouTube streaming experiments in a resource constrained scenario, we demonstrate that the CRL approach can increase quality of experience (QOE) by over 30\%.</description>

      <title>COBRAPRO: A MATLAB toolbox for Physics-based Battery Modeling and Co-simulation Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: COBRAPRO is a new open-source physics-based battery modeling software with the capability to conduct closed-loop parameter optimization using experimental data. Physics-based battery models require systematic parameter calibration to accurately predict battery behavior across different usage scenarios. While parameter calibration is essential to predict the dynamic behavior of batteries, many existing open-source DFN modeling tools lack integrated parameter identification routines. COBRAPRO addresses this gap by featuring an embedded parameter optimization framework that optimizes the model parameters by minimizing the error between the simulated and experimentally observed current-voltage data. With COBRAPRO, users can non-invasively identify unknown battery model parameters for any given battery chemistry.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions for Stochastic Systems and Safety-critical Control Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08728v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the analysis of a control barrier function has received considerable attention because it is helpful for the safety-critical control required in many control application problems. While the extension of the analysis to a stochastic system studied by many researchers, it remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we consider sufficient conditions for reciprocal and zeroing control barrier functions ensuring safety with probability one and design a control law using the functions. Then, we propose another version of a stochastic zeroing control barrier function to evaluate a probability of a sample path staying in a safe set and confirm the convergence of a specific expectation related to the attractiveness of a safe set. We also show a way of deisgning a safety-critical control law based on our stochastic zeroing control barrier function. Finally, we confirm the validity of the proposed control design and the analysis using the control barrier functions via simple examples with their numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Approximation with Random Shallow ReLU Networks with Applications to Model Reference Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are regularly employed in adaptive control of nonlinear systems and related methods of reinforcement learning. A common architecture uses a neural network with a single hidden layer (i.e. a shallow network), in which the weights and biases are fixed in advance and only the output layer is trained. While classical results show that there exist neural networks of this type that can approximate arbitrary continuous functions over bounded regions, they are non-constructive, and the networks used in practice have no approximation guarantees. Thus, the approximation properties required for control with neural networks are assumed, rather than proved. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by showing that for sufficiently smooth functions, ReLU networks with randomly generated weights and biases achieve $L_{\infty}$ error of $O(m^{-1/2})$ with high probability, where $m$ is the number of neurons. It suffices to generate the weights uniformly over a sphere and the biases uniformly over an interval. We show how the result can be used to get approximations of required accuracy in a model reference adaptive control application.</description>
