      <title>Chaos of charged particles near a renormalized group improved Kerr black hole in an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a quantum theory of gravity, a renormalization group improved Kerr metric is obtained from the Kerr metric, where the Newton gravitational constant is modified as a function of the radial distance. The motion of neutral test particles in this metric is integrable. However, the dynamics of charged test particles is nonintegrable when an external asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field exists in the vicinity of the black hole. The transition from regular dynamics to chaotic dynamics is numerically traced as one or two dynamical parameters vary. From a statistical point of view, the strength of chaos is typically enhanced as both the particle energy and the magnetic field increase, but it is weakened with increasing the particle angular momentum and the black hole spin. In particular, an increase of the quantum corrected parameter weakens the extent of chaos. This is because the running Newton gravity constant effectively weakens the central gravitational attraction and results in decreasing sensitivity to initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Triadic percolation on multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Network Dynamics-Based Framework for Understanding Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02436v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence call for a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying deep learning. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze learning dynamics through the lens of dynamical systems theory. We redefine the notions of linearity and nonlinearity in neural networks by introducing two fundamental transformation units at the neuron level: order-preserving transformations and non-order-preserving transformations. Different transformation modes lead to distinct collective behaviors in weight vector organization, different modes of information extraction, and the emergence of qualitatively different learning phases. Transitions between these phases may occur during training, accounting for key phenomena such as grokking. To further characterize generalization and structural stability, we introduce the concept of attraction basins in both sample and weight spaces. The distribution of neurons with different transformation modes across layers, along with the structural characteristics of the two types of attraction basins, forms a set of core metrics for analyzing the performance of learning models. Hyperparameters such as depth, width, learning rate, and batch size act as control variables for fine-tuning these metrics. Our framework not only sheds light on the intrinsic advantages of deep learning, but also provides a novel perspective for optimizing network architectures and training strategies.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaotic synchronization in coupled dissipative time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</description>
