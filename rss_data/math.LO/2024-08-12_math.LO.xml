      <title>Strong standard completeness theorems for S5-modal Lukasiewicz logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the S5-modal expansion of the logic based on the Lukasiewicz t-norm. We exhibit a finitary propositional calculus and show that it is finitely strongly complete with respect to this logic. This propositional calculus is then expanded with an infinitary rule to achieve strong completeness. These results are derived from properties of monadic MValgebras: functional representations of simple and finitely subdirectly irreducible algebras, as well as the finite embeddability property. We also show similar completeness theorems for the extension of the logic based on models with bounded universe.</description>

      <title>Strong completeness for the predicate logic of the continuous t-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axiomatic system introduced by H\'ajek axiomatizes first-order logic based on BL-chains. In this study, we extend this system with the axiom $(\forall x \phi)^2 \leftrightarrow \forall x \phi^2$ and the infinitary rule \[ \frac{\phi \vee (\alpha \to \beta^n):n \in \mathbb{N}}{\phi \vee (\alpha \to \alpha \&amp; \beta)} \] to achieve strong completeness with respect to continuous t-norms.</description>

      <title>Information vs Dimension -- an Algorithmic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper surveys work on the relation between fractal dimensions and algorithmic information theory over the past thirty years. It covers the basic development of prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity from an information theoretic point of view, before introducing Hausdorff measures and dimension along with some important examples. The main goal of the paper is to motivate and develop the informal identity "entropy = complexity = dimension" from first principles. The last section of the paper presents some new observations on multifractal measures from an algorithmic viewpoint.</description>

      <title>On Ramsey-type properties of the distance in nonseparable spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an uncountable subset $\mathcal Y$ of a nonseparable Banach space, is there an uncountable $\mathcal Z\subseteq \mathcal Y$ such that the distances between any two distinct points of $\mathcal Z$ are more or less the same? If an uncountable subset $\mathcal Y$ of a nonseparable Banach space does not admit an uncountable $\mathcal Z\subseteq \mathcal Y$, where any two points are distant by more than $r&gt;0$, is it because $\mathcal Y$ is the countable union of sets of diameters not bigger than $r$?
  We investigate connections between the set-theoretic phenomena involved and the geometric properties of uncountable subsets of nonseparable Banach spaces of densities up to $2^\omega$ related to uncountable $(1+)$-separated sets, equilateral sets or Auerbach systems.
  The results include geometric dichotomies for a wide range of classes of Banach spaces, some in ZFC, some under the assumption of OCA+MA and some under a hypothesis on the descriptive complexity of the space as well as constructions (in ZFC or under CH) of Banach spaces where the geometry of the unit sphere displays anti-Ramsey properties. This complements classical theorems for separable spheres and the recent results of H\'ajek, Kania, Russo for densities above $2^\omega$ as well as offers a synthesis of possible phenomena and categorization of examples for uncountable densities up to $2^\omega$ obtained previously by the author and Guzm\'an, Hru\v{s}\'ak, Ryduchowski and Wark.
  It remains open if the dichotomies may consistently hold for all Banach spaces of the first uncountable density or if the strong anti-Ramsey properties of the distance on the unit sphere of a Banach space can be obtained in ZFC.</description>

      <title>Meta-Modelling in Formal Concept Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis starts from a very basic data structure comprising objects and their attributes. Sometimes, however, it is beneficial to also define attributes of attributes, viz., meta-attributes. In this paper, we use Triadic Formal Concept Analysis, a triadic approach to Formal Concept Analysis, to develop a framework for this kind of meta-modelling in Formal Concept Analysis, including formal definitions and appropriate visualizations.</description>

      <title>Oscillating and nonsummable Radon-Nikodym cocycles along the forward geodesic of measure-class-preserving transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the least-deletion map on the Cantor space, namely the map that changes the first 1 in a binary sequence to 0, and construct product measures on $2^\mathbb{N}$ so that the corresponding Radon-Nikodym cocycles oscillate or converge to zero nonsummably along the forward geodesic of the map. These examples answer two questions of Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob. We analyze the oscillating example in terms of random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, using the Chung-Fuchs theorem.</description>

      <title>Semantical Analysis of Intuitionistic Modal Logics between CK and IK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intuitionistic modal logics considered between Constructive K (CK) and Intuitionistic K (IK) differ in their treatment of the possibility (diamond) connective. It was recently rediscovered that some logics between CK and IK also disagree on their diamond-free fragments, with only some remaining conservative over the standard axiomatisation of intuitionistic modal logic with necessity (box) alone. We show that relational Kripke semantics for CK can be extended with frame conditions for all axioms in the standard axiomatisation of IK, as well as other axioms previously studied. This allows us to answer open questions about the (non-)conservativity of such logics over intuitionistic modal logic without diamond. Our results are formalised using the Coq Proof Assistant.</description>
