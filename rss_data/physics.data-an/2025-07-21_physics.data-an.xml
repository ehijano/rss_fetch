      <title>Physics-guided impact localisation and force estimation in composite plates with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-guided approaches offer a promising path toward accurate and generalisable impact identification in composite structures, especially when experimental data are sparse. This paper presents a hybrid framework for impact localisation and force estimation in composite plates, combining a data-driven implementation of First-Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) with machine learning and uncertainty quantification. The structural configuration and material properties are inferred from dispersion relations, while boundary conditions are identified via modal characteristics to construct a low-fidelity but physically consistent FSDT model. This model enables physics-informed data augmentation for extrapolative localisation using supervised learning. Simultaneously, an adaptive regularisation scheme derived from the same model improves the robustness of impact force reconstruction. The framework also accounts for uncertainty by propagating localisation uncertainty through the force estimation process, producing probabilistic outputs. Validation on composite plate experiments confirms the framework's accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in reducing dependence on large training datasets. The proposed method offers a scalable and transferable solution for impact monitoring and structural health management in composite aerostructures.</description>

      <title>Information-Assisted Carnot Engine Surpasses Standard Thermodynamic Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information can improve heat engine performance, but the underlying principles are still not so clear. Here we introduce a Carnot information machine (CIE) and obtain a quantitative relationship between the engine performance and information. We demonstrate that the presence of information changes allows the CIE to operate as a heat engine in the regime where the standard Carnot cycle is prohibited, ensures that the efficiency of the CIE is greater than or equal to the standard Carnot efficiency, and significantly enables it to achieve 100\% efficiency with positive work extraction for arbitrary two-level systems. We explicitly demonstrate these features using a spin-1/2 system and propose an experimental implementation scheme based on a trapped $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion.</description>

      <title>Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and plasma density for laser-plasma experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma characteristics which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.\\ Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.\\ In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.</description>

      <title>Deep Image Reconstruction for Background Subtraction in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet reconstruction in an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision suffers from a notoriously large, fluctuating thermal background. Traditional background subtraction methods struggle to remove this soft background while preserving the jet's hard substructure. In this Letter, we present DeepSub, the first machine learning-based approach for full-event background subtraction. DeepSub utilizes a model based on Swin Transformer layers to denoise jet images and disentangle hard jets from the heavy-ion background. DeepSub significantly outperforms existing subtraction techniques by reproducing key jet observables such as jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ and mass, and substructure observables such as girth and the energy correlation function, at the sub-percent to percent level. As such, DeepSub paves the way for precision heavy-ion measurements in hitherto inaccessible kinematic regimes.</description>

      <title>Global $q$-dependent inverse transforms of intensity autocorrelation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new analysis approach for intensity autocorrelation data, as measured with dynamic light scattering and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. Our analysis generalizes the established CONTIN and MULTIQ methods by direct nonlinear modeling of the $g_2$ function, enabling decomposition of complex dynamics without a priori knowledge of experimental scaling factors. We describe the mathematical formulation, implementation details, and strategies for solution, as well as demonstrate decompositions of soft matter dynamics data into distributions of diffusion rates/velocities. The open-source MATLAB implementation, including example data, is publicly available for adoption and further development.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Learning in Lagrangian Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for training dynamical systems governed by Lagrangian mechanics using Equilibrium Propagation. Our approach extends Equilibrium Propagation - initially developed for energy-based models - to dynamical trajectories by leveraging the principle of action extremization. Training is achieved by gently nudging trajectories toward desired targets and measuring how the variables conjugate to the parameters to be trained respond. This method is particularly suited to systems with periodic boundary conditions or fixed initial and final states, enabling efficient parameter updates without requiring explicit backpropagation through time. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, this approach yields the semiclassical limit of Quantum Equilibrium Propagation. Applications to systems with dissipation are also discussed.</description>
