      <title>Deep learning inference with the Event Horizon Telescope III. Zingularity results from the 2017 observations and predictions for future array expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) In the first two papers of this publication series, we present a comprehensive library of synthetic EHT observations and used this library to train and validate Bayesian neural networks for the parameter inference of accreting supermassive black hole systems. The considered models are ray-traced GRMHD simulations of Sgr A* and M87*. In this work, we infer the best-fitting accretion and black hole parameters from 2017 EHT data and predict improvements that will come with future upgrades of the array. Compared to previous EHT analyses, we considered a substantially larger synthetic data library and the most complete set of information from the observational data. We made use of the Bayesian nature of the trained neural networks and apply bootstrapping of known systematics in the observational data to obtain parameter posteriors. Within a wide GRMHD parameter space, we find M87* to be best described by a spin between 0.5 and 0.94 with a retrograde MAD accretion flow and strong synchrotron emission from the jet. Sgr A* has a high spin of $\sim$ 0.8 $-$ 0.9 and a prograde accretion flow beyond the standard MAD/SANE models with a comparatively weak jet emission, seen at a $\sim$ 20$^\circ$ $-$ 40$^\circ$ inclination and $\sim$ 106$^\circ$ $-$ 137$^\circ$ position angle. While previous EHT analyses could rule out specific regions in the model parameter space considered here, we are able to obtain narrow parameter posteriors with our Zingularity framework without being impacted by the unknown foreground Faraday screens and data calibration biases. We further demonstrate that the AMT extension to the EHT will reduce parameter inference errors by a factor of three for non-Kerr models, enabling more robust tests of general relativity. It will be instructive to produce new GRMHD models with the inferred interpolated parameters to study their accretion rate plus jet power.</description>

      <title>Limits to Extracting Neutron-Star Physics Constraints from NICER Pulse Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling energy-dependent X-ray pulse profiles from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed with NICER has emerged as a promising avenue for measuring neutron star radii and probing the equation of state of cold, ultra-dense matter. However, pulse profile models have often required an unwieldy number of parameters to account for complex surface emission geometries, introducing the risk of overfitting and degeneracies. To explore the number of model parameters that can be inferred uniquely, we perform a quantitative assessment of the information content in X-ray pulse profiles by applying Fourier methods. We determine the number of independent observables that can be reliably extracted from the pulse shapes, as well as from complementary X-ray spectral data obtained with XMM-Newton, for key NICER targets. Our analysis provides a framework for evaluating the match between model complexity and data constraints. It also demonstrates the importance of incorporating in the model the pulsed components of the magnetospheric non-thermal emission, which often contributes significantly to the observed spectra. Our results highlight limitations in previous inferences of neutron-star radii from NICER observations, which have incorporated model complexity not supported by the data.</description>

      <title>Search for Astrophysical Transients on Limiting Time Scales and Their Classification Based on INTEGRAL Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have searched for ultra-long (&gt; 100 s) gamma-ray transients in the data from the anticoincidence shield (ACS) of the SPI gamma-ray spectrometer onboard the INTEGRAL orbital observatory and classified them by machine learning methods. We have found about 4364 candidates for such events in the SPI-ACS data by the `blind' threshold search method. We have developed an algorithm for automatic processing of their light curves that distinguishes a candidate for transients on various time scales and allows its duration and fluence to be determined. The algorithm has been applied to calculate (and compare) the fluxes in the light curves recorded by various INTEGRAL detectors: IREM, SPI-ACS, SPI, ISGRI, and PICsIT. These fluxes have been used to train the classifier based on gradient boosting. Subsequently, we have performed a cluster analysis of the candidates found by the dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. In conclusion we have compared the remaining candidates with the data from the Konus-WIND gamma-ray detectors. Thus, we have confirmed 16 candidates for astrophysical transients, including four candidates for ultra-long gamma-ray bursts from the events detected by the SPI-ACS detector. Out of the probable events, but unconfirmed by other experiments, up to 270 events can be classified as real gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Irradiated Circumbinary Disks around Binary Black Holes Governed by Hydrogen Opacities Dependent on Temperature and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermal and spectral properties of irradiated circumbinary disks (CBDs) around binary black holes (BBHs), using analytic, hydrogen-based opacity models that capture key dependencies on temperature, density, and ionization. We solve the vertically hydrostatic energy balance equations with Rosseland mean opacities from free-free absorption, bound-free absorption, and electron scattering processes, combined with ionization fractions derived by the Saha equation. Four opacity models are considered, including a reference model with no physical opacity, constructed by Lee et al. (2024), and three physically motivated alternatives. The midplane temperature profiles show significant variation across models, while the surface temperature remains largely unchanged in regions dominated by viscous heating. Opacity effects become pronounced in the outer disk, where irradiation reprocessing shapes the IR-optical continuum. Inclusion of bound-free opacity introduces a noticeable flattening and a mid-frequency peak in the spectral energy distribution. We also compute spectra of a triple disk system including the CBD and two accreting minidisks. The high-frequency peak arises from the hot minidisks, while the low-frequency excess originates from irradiated outer CBD layers. By comparing model spectra with detection limits of Subaru, JWST, and Swift, we find that systems within $\sim10$ Mpc may show detectable IR excess from the CBD. Our results highlight the need for accurate opacity modeling to interpret electromagnetic signatures of black hole mergers and support future integration of opacity tables with metallicity.</description>

      <title>Precise Hubble constant measurement from quasi-periodic eruptions as electromagnetic counterparts to extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Here we study the secular orbital evolution of QPE systems under different theoretical frameworks, and assess their GWs detectability by LISA. We find that LISA can detect the EMRI signals of two or three known QPE systems with a four-year observation. One EMRI event can measure the $H_0$ with an uncertainty of $3\%-8\%$ at a 68.3 percent confidence level, while a few events will reduce it below $2\%$. The EMRI events surpass current bright siren limitations and offer an independent pathway to resolve the Hubble constant tension.</description>

      <title>The 2MIG isolated AGNs -- 2. X-ray general properties and peculiarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analyzed a sample of 2MIG isolated galaxies hosting AGNs (isolated AGNs) to assess whether their nuclear activity differs from that in a denser environment. The isolation criteria rule out interactions with other galaxies of similar size for at least $\sim$3 Gyr. We systemized the available Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and INTEGRAL X-ray data for isolated AGN at $z&lt;0.05$, determining their general X-ray properties and peculiarities, spectral models, SMBH masses, and possible parameter correlations. We investigated the best spectral models of 25 isolated AGNs, including 10 recently fitted in this work. The intrinsic luminosities $\log L_{2-10,\mathrm{keV}}$ do not exceed $\sim43$.
  Our results indicate that the isolation of galaxies in the nearby Universe does not significantly affect nuclear activity. This is confirmed by the diversity of accretion types and the absence of any advantage of one particular basic/compound spectral model. We note an interesting case discovered for the ESO499-041 spectrum, where the data-to-model ratio shows significant changes after 6.4 keV. These deviations from the continuum may indicate the presence of a relativistic Iron line in the Chandra spectrum of ESO 499-041 compared to the Swift spectrum. Most isolated AGNs contain SMBH with $M_{\mathrm{SMBH}} \leq 10^7,M_{\odot}$. For the first time, we found a linear correlation between $L_{2-10,\mathrm{keV}}$ and $\log M_{\mathrm{SMBH}}$ that is not observed in other AGN samples. This trend may be affected by the limited sample size and requires further confirmation with larger datasets. Finally, we identified UGC10120, NG6300, and CGCG243-024 as promising candidates for Milky Way analogues.</description>

      <title>VLBA astrometry of PSRs B0329+54 and B1133+16: Improved pulsar distances and comparison of global ionospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) astrometry is used to determine the three-dimensional position and proper motion of astronomical objects. A typical VLBI astrometric campaign generally includes around ten observations, making it challenging to characterise systematic uncertainties. Our study on two bright pulsars, B0329+54 and B1133+16, involves analysis of broadband Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data over $\sim30$ epochs (spanning approximately $3.5\, {\rm years}$). This extended dataset has significantly improved the precision of the astrometric estimates of these pulsars. Our broadband study suggests that, as expected, the primary contribution to systematic uncertainties in L-band VLBI astrometry originates from the ionosphere. We have also assessed the effectiveness of the modified TEC (total electron content) mapping function, which converts vertical TEC to slant TEC, in correcting ionospheric dispersive delays using global TEC maps. The parallax and proper motion obtained from the multiple data sets, calibrated using the traditional and the modified TEC mapping functions, are consistent. However, the reduced chi-square values from least-squares fitting and precision of the fitted astrometric parameters show no significant improvement, and hence, the effectiveness of the new TEC mapping function on astrometry is unclear. For B0329+54, the refined parallax estimate is $0.611^{+0.013}_{-0.013}\, {\rm mas}$, with best-fit proper motion of $\mu_{\alpha} = 16.960^{+0.011}_{-0.010}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ in R.A. and and $\mu_{\delta} = -10.382^{+0.022}_{-0.022}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ in Dec. For B1133+16, the new estimated parallax is $2.705^{+0.009}_{-0.009}\, {\rm mas}$, with proper motions of $\mu_{\alpha} = -73.777^{+0.008}_{-0.008}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ and $\mu_{\delta} = 366.573^{+0.019}_{-0.019}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>The radio properties of quasi-periodic X-ray eruption sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions (QPEs) are a new class of repeating nuclear transient in which repeating X-ray flares are observed coming from the nuclei of generally low mass galaxies. Here we present a comprehensive summary of the radio properties of 12 bona-fide quasi-periodic eruption sources, including a mix of known tidal disruption events (TDEs) and AGN-like hosts. We include a combination of new dedicated radio observations and archival/previously published radio observations to compile a catalogue of radio observations of each source in the sample. We examine the overall radio properties of the sample and compare to the radio properties of known TDEs, given the apparent link between QPEs and TDEs. Overall we find compact, weak radio sources associated with 5/12 of the QPE sources and no signatures of strong AGN activity via a luminous radio jet. We find no radio variability or correlation between radio emission and the X-ray QPE properties, implying that the mechanism that produces the X-ray flares does not generate strong radio-emitting outflows. The compactness of the radio sources and lack of correlation between radio luminosity and SMBH mass is very unusual for AGN, but the radio spectra and luminosities are consistent with outflows produced by a recent TDE (or accretion event), in both the known TDE sources as well as the AGN-like sources in the sample.</description>

      <title>FAST Pulsar Database: II. Scattering profiles of 122 Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turbulent ionized interstellar medium diffracts radio waves and makes them propagate in multiple paths. The pulse-broadening observed at low frequencies results from the scattering effect of interstellar clouds of ionized gas. During the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey and other projects by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we detect the pulse-broadening for 122 pulsars in the radio frequency band between 1.0 and 1.5 GHz, including 60 newly discovered pulsars in the GPPS survey and 62 previously known pulsars. We find that a more accurate dispersion measure can be obtained from aligning the front edge of the scattered subband pulses at the 1/4 or 1/2 peak level for most pulsars with one dominant component in the intrinsic profile, and the best DM values from aligning the intrinsic profile components from the model-fitting. From the pulse profiles at a few subbands we derive the pulse-broadening timescale and the scattering spectral index. These scattering parameters are measured for the first time for 93 pulsars. For 29 pulsars with previously detected scattering features, our measurements of the pulse-broadening timescale are consistent with results in the literature. We find that pulsars behind spiral arms show a stronger scattering effect due to greater density fluctuations in the arm regions. With a properly derived dispersion measure and careful calibration, we also present polarization profiles for 41 pulsars in three subbands of FAST observations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated inference of binary black-hole populations from the stochastic gravitational-wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to observe $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ of overlapping signals per year from a multitude of astrophysical sources that will be computationally challenging to resolve individually. On the other hand, the stochastic background resulting from the entire population of sources encodes information about the underlying population, allowing for population parameter inference independent and complementary to that obtained with individually resolved events. Parameter estimation in this case is still computationally challenging, as computing the power spectrum involves sampling $\sim 10^5$ sources for each set of hyperparameters describing the binary population. In this work, we build on recently developed importance sampling techniques to compute the SGWB efficiently and train neural networks to interpolate the resulting background. We show that a multi-layer perceptron can encode the model information, allowing for significantly faster inference. We test the network assuming an observing setup with CE and ET sensitivities, where for the first time we include the intrinsic variance of the SGWB in the inference, as in this setup it presents a dominant source of measurement noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of rotating viscous stars, using the causal relativistic hydrodynamics of Bemfica, Disconzi, Kovtun, and Noronha. We derive, in a slow-rotation approximation, a coupled system of equations describing the propagation of axial gravitational waves through the star, which couple to internal viscous modes. We show that rotating viscous stars amplify incoming low-frequency gravitational waves, a phenomenon which we argue to be universal. Superradiant amplification does not seem to trigger an instability for uniformly rotating stars, even if the object is compact enough to have light rings.</description>

      <title>The fast, the slow and the merging: probes of evaporating memory burdened PBHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called memory-burden effect implies that evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) inevitably stabilize before complete decay. This stabilization opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter below $10^{15}\,$g. The transition to the memory-burdened phase is not instantaneous but unfolds over cosmological timescales, with some PBHs entering this phase in the present epoch. Additionally, a fraction of PBHs undergo mergers today, forming ''young'' semiclassical black holes that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. Both processes generate fluxes of stable astrophysical particles, which are constrained by current measurements of high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. Moreover, the steep increase in energy injection at higher redshifts perturbs the ionization history of the Universe, leading to complementary bounds from observations of the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. We find that the reopened window enabled by the memory-burden effect is largely within reach of detection, both locally and across cosmological distances. We further describe how our findings restrict the values of the critical exponent characterizing the memory burden phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Beyond diagonal approximations: improved covariance modeling for pulsar timing array data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for nHz gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) typically model time-correlated noise by assuming a diagonal covariance in Fourier space, neglecting inter-frequency correlations introduced by the finite observation window. We show that this diagonal approximation can lead to biased estimates of spectral parameters, especially for the common red process that represents the GWB. To address these limitations, we present a method that (i) computes the time-domain autocorrelation on a coarse grid using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), (ii) interpolates it accurately to the unevenly sampled observation times, and (iii) incorporates it into a low-rank likelihood via the Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury identity. Using both analytic covariance comparisons and end-to-end simulations inspired by the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we demonstrate that our method captures frequency correlations faithfully, avoids Gibbs ringing, and recovers unbiased spectral parameters with modest computational cost. As PTA datasets increase in sensitivity and complexity, our approach offers a practical and scalable path to fully accurate covariance modeling for current and future analyses.</description>

      <title>Black Hole - Neutron Star and Binary Neutron Star Mergers from Population III and II stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population III (Pop.$~$III) stars are expected to be massive and to undergo minimal mass loss due to their lack of metals, making them ideal progenitors of black holes and neutron stars. Here, we investigate the formation and properties of binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers originating from Pop.$~$III stars, and compare them to their metal-enriched Population II (Pop.$~$II) counterparts, focusing on their merger rate densities (MRDs), primary masses and delay times. We find that, despite the high merger efficiency of Pop.$~$III BNSs and BHNSs, their low star formation rate results in a MRD at least one order of magnitude lower than that of Pop.$~$II stars. The MRD of Pop.$~$III BNSs peaks at redshift $z\sim15$, attaining a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BNS}(z\sim15) \sim 15\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, while the MRD of Pop.$~$III BHNSs is maximum at $z\sim13$, reaching a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BHNS}(z\sim13) \sim 2\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$. Finally, we observe that the black hole masses of Pop.$~$III BHNS mergers have a nearly flat distribution with a peak at $\sim 20\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and extending up to $\sim 50\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Black holes in Pop.$~$II BHNS mergers show instead a peak at $\lesssim 15\,\rm M_{\odot}$. We consider these predictions in light of recent gravitational-wave observations in the local Universe, finding that a Pop.$~$III origin is preferred relative to Pop.$~$II for some events.</description>

      <title>Deep learning inference with the Event Horizon Telescope I. Calibration improvements and a comprehensive synthetic data library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) In a series of publications, we describe a comprehensive comparison of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data with theoretical models of Sgr A* and M87*. Here, we report on improvements made to our observational data reduction pipeline and present the generation of observables derived from the EHT models. We make use of ray-traced GRMHD simulations that are based on different black hole spacetime metrics and accretion physics parameters. These broad classes of models provide a good representation of the primary targets observed by the EHT. To generate realistic synthetic data from our models, we took the signal path as well as the calibration process, and thereby the aforementioned improvements, into account. We could thus produce synthetic visibilities akin to calibrated EHT data and identify salient features for the discrimination of model parameters. We have produced a library consisting of an unparalleled 962,000 synthetic Sgr A* and M87* datasets. In terms of baseline coverage and noise properties, the library encompasses 2017 EHT measurements as well as future observations with an extended telescope array. We differentiate between robust visibility data products related to model features and data products that are strongly affected by data corruption effects. Parameter inference is mostly limited by intrinsic model variability, which highlights the importance of long-term monitoring observations with the EHT. In later papers in this series, we will show how a Bayesian neural network trained on our synthetic data is capable of dealing with the model variability and extracting physical parameters from EHT observations. With our calibration improvements, our newly reduced EHT datasets have a considerably better quality compared to previously analyzed data.</description>

      <title>Deep learning inference with the Event Horizon Telescope II. The Zingularity framework for Bayesian artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) In this second paper in our publication series, we present the open-source Zingularity framework for parameter inference with deep Bayesian artificial neural networks. We carried out out supervised learning with synthetic millimeter very long baseline interferometry observations of the EHT. Our ground-truth models are based on GRMHD simulations of Sgr A* and M87* on horizon scales. We investigated how well Zingularity neural networks are able to infer key model parameters from EHT observations, such as the black hole spin and the magnetic state of the accretion disk, when uncertainties in the data are accurately taken into account. Zingularity makes use of the TensorFlow Probability library and is able to handle large amounts of data with a combination of the efficient TFRecord data format plus the Horovod framework. Our approach is the first analysis of EHT data with Bayesian neural networks, where an unprecedented training data size, under consideration of a closely modeled EHT signal path, and the full information content of the observational data are used. Zingularity infers parameters based on salient features in the data and is containerized. Through parameter surveys and dedicated validation tests, we identified neural network architectures, that are robust against internal stochastic processes and unaffected by noise in the observational and model data. We give examples of how different data properties affect the network training. We show how the Bayesian nature of our networks gives trustworthy uncertainties and uncovers failure modes for uncharacterizable data. It is easy to achieve low validation errors during training on synthetic data with neural networks, particularly when the forward modeling is too simplified. Through careful studies, we demonstrate that our trained networks can generalize well so that reliable results can be obtained from observational data.</description>

      <title>Extreme AGN feedback in the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole feedback is the currently favoured mechanism to regulate the star formation rate of galaxies and prevent the formation of ultra-massive galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{12}M_\odot$). However, the mechanism through which the outflowing energy is transferred to the surrounding medium strongly varies from one galaxy evolution model to another, such that a unified model for AGN feedback does not currently exist. The hot atmospheres of galaxy groups are highly sensitive laboratories of the feedback process, as the injected black hole energy is comparable to the binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we report multi-wavelength observations of the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436. The hot atmosphere of this system exhibits a highly relaxed morphology centred on the giant elliptical galaxy NGC~3298. The X-ray emission from the system features a compact core ($&lt;$10 kpc) and a steep increase in the entropy and cooling time of the gas, with the cooling time reaching the age of the Universe $\sim15$ kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The observed entropy profile implies a total injected energy of $\sim1.5\times10^{61}$ ergs, which given the high level of relaxation could not have been injected by a recent merging event. Star formation in the central galaxy NGC~3298 is strongly quenched and its stellar population is very old ($\sim$10.6 Gyr). The currently detected radio jets have low power and are confined within the central compact core. All the available evidence implies that this system was affected by giant AGN outbursts which excessively heated the neighbouring gas and prevented the formation of a self-regulated feedback cycle. Our findings imply that AGN outbursts can be energetic enough to unbind gas particles and lead to the disruption of cool cores.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation Signatures from Primordial Black Holes Transiting the Inner Solar System: Prospects for Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-mass'' window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter signals in solar neutrinos fluxes as probe of non-linear symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) particles gravitationally captured by the Sun can accumulate in its core and subsequently annihilate, producing neutrino fluxes that may be detectable on Earth. The intensity of these fluxes is highly sensitive to the properties of the underlying DM model, especially when the DM candidate is a scalar particle originating from spontaneous or non-linear symmetry breaking mechanisms. In this work, we explore the potential of solar neutrino fluxes to distinguish between the Standard Model extended by a scalar singlet and the non-linear Higgs portal scenarios in the context of a future DM discovery. We compute the expected neutrino fluxes within the regions of parameter space consistent with both relic density and current direct detection limits. Our results show that the non-linear model predicts neutrino fluxes that are systematically larger than those of the linear case, typically by at least one order of magnitude, and up to six orders of magnitude for DM masses around 1 TeV. These findings suggest that solar neutrino observations could provide a valuable probe to discriminate between these competing dark matter frameworks.</description>

      <title>Progress toward the detection of the gravitational-wave background from stellar-mass binary black holes: a mock data challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the third LIGO--Virgo gravitational-wave transient catalog includes 90 signals, it is believed that ${\cal O}(10^5)$ binary black holes merge somewhere in the Universe every year. Although these signals are too weak to be detected individually with current observatories, they combine to create a stochastic background, which is potentially detectable in the near future. LIGO--Virgo searches for the gravitational-wave background using cross-correlation have so far yielded upper limits. However, Smith \&amp; Thrane (2017) showed that a vastly more sensitive ``coherent'' search can be carried out by incorporating information about the phase evolution of binary black hole signals. This improved sensitivity comes at a cost; the coherent method is computationally expensive and requires a far more detailed understanding of systematic errors than is required for the cross-correlation search. In this work, we demonstrate the coherent approach with realistic data, paving the way for a gravitational-wave background search with unprecedented sensitivity.</description>

      <title>SAS in ESA Datalabs: A New Platform for XMM-Newton Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: XMM-Newton is a cornerstone mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) for X-ray astronomy, providing high-quality X-ray data for astrophysical research since the start of the century. Its Science Analysis System (SAS) has been a reliable data reduction and analysis software, evolving throughout the years to meet changing user needs, while incorporating new methods. This paper presents the XMM-SAS Datalab, a tool within the cloud-based ESA Datalabs platform, designed to enhance the interactivity and collaborative potential of SAS. By integrating SAS with a modern, Python-based JupyterLab interface, it enables shared analysis workspaces, removes the need for local software setup, and provides faster access through containerised environments and preconfigured libraries. Moving SAS to the cloud preserves a consistent software setup while eliminating installation complexities, saving time and effort. A case study of the X-ray binary Vela X-1 demonstrates that the Datalabs platform reliably replicates local SAS outputs, with minimal deviations attributed to calibration file versions. The XMM-SAS Datalab allows straightforward X-ray data analysis with collaborative process, setting the way for future adaptations in e-science platforms and multi-wavelength astronomy, while offering traceability and reproducibility of scientific results.</description>

      <title>An independent search for Jovian neutrinos using BOREXINO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent study, arXiv:2401.13043 found evidence for a 6% flux contribution from Jupiter to the total flux rate time series data from the BOREXINO solar neutrino experiment, specifically during the time intervals 2019-2021 and 2011-2013. The significance of this detection was estimated to be around $2\sigma$. We reanalyze the BOREXINO data and independently confirm the Jovian signal with the same amplitude and significance as that obtained in arXiv:2401.13043. However, using the same technique, we also find a spurious flux contribution from Venus and Saturn (at $\sim 2\sigma$ significance), whereas prima facie one should not expect any signal from any other planet. We then implement Bayesian model comparison to ascertain whether the BOREXINO data contain an additional contribution from Jupiter, Venus or Saturn. We find Bayes factors of less than five for an additional contribution from Jupiter, and less than or close to one for Venus and Saturn. This implies that the evidence for an additional contribution from Jupiter is very marginal.</description>

      <title>Axion-like particle limits from multi-messenger sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy neutrino observation from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 offers new insights into the non-thermal processes of active galactic nuclei. Simultaneous gamma-rays emitted by such sources can possibly oscillate into axion-like particles (ALPs) when propagating through astrophysical magnetic fields, potentially modifying the observed spectrum. To probe for ALP-induced signals, a robust understanding of the emission processes at the source is necessary. In this work, we perform a dedicated multi-messenger analysis by modeling a jet in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole of NGC 1068. We model in particular the neutrino and gamma-ray emission originating in lepto-hadronic collisions between jet accelerated particles and background particles from the corona, reproducing both the Fermi-LAT and IceCube data. These source models serve as a baseline for ALP searches, and we derive limits on the ALP-photon coupling by marginalizing over motivated ranges of astrophysical parameters. We find $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 7 \times 10^{-11}$GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9}$ eV. These limits may be weaker than existing constraints, but they demonstrate the potential of multi-messenger observations to probe new physics. We conclude by discussing how additional upcoming multi-messenger sources and improved observational precision can enhance ALP sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: Quadratic gravity theories emerge as the low-energy limit of many grand-unified and quantum-gravity theories. We report the first gravitational-wave ringdown constraints on such theories obtained purely from the quasinormal-mode spectra of rapidly-spinning black-hole remnants. We find no quadratic-gravity signatures from ringdown signals measured by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, thereby constraining the coupling length scale of axi-dilaton gravity below 34 km, dynamical Chern-Simons gravity below 49 km, and scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity below 47 km.</description>

Abstract: Extracting the faint gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal from dominant detector noise and disentangling its %diverse astrophysical and cosmological components remain significant challenges for traditional methods like cross-correlation analysis. We propose a novel hybrid approach that combines deep learning with Bayesian inference to identify and characterize the GWB more rapidly than current techniques. Our method utilizes a custom-designed multi-scale multi-headed autoencoder (MSMHAutoencoder) architecture to separate GWB signals from detector noise, and subsequently Marcov Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation to disentangle the GWB components. Using simulated data representative of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network at design sensitivity, we show that our MSMHAutoencoder can detect with high confidence (log noise Bayes factor of 3) a GWB from binary black hole mergers with fractional energy density $\Omega_{\text{BBH}} \approx 10^{-9}$ at 25 Hz. In the presence of such an astrophysical GWB, we can simultaneously measure a cosmological component as faint as $\Omega_{\text{Cosmo}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-10}$ using 47.4 days of training data.</description>

      <title>All known Type Ia supernovae models fail to reproduce the observed bolometric luminosity-width correlation</title>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely believed to arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs). However, ongoing debate surrounds their progenitor systems and the mechanisms triggering these explosions. Recently, Sharon \&amp; Kushnir showed that existing models do not reproduce the observed positive correlation between the $\gamma$-ray escape time, $t_0$, and the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass, $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$. Their analysis, while avoiding complex radiation transfer (RT) calculations, did not account for the viewing-angle dependence of the derived $t_0$ and $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ in multi-dimensional (multi-D) models during pre-nebular phases, where most observations performed. Here, we aim to identify an observational width-luminosity relation, similar to the $t_0$-$M_\mathrm{Ni56}$ relation to constrain multi-D models during pre-nebular phases while minimizing RT calculation uncertainties. We show that the bolometric luminosity at $t\le30$ days since explosion can be accurately computed without non-thermal ionization considerations, which are computationally expensive and uncertain. We find that the ratio of the bolometric luminosity at 30 days since explosion to the peak luminosity, $L_{30}/Lp$, correlates strongly with $t_0$. Using a sample of well-observed SNe Ia, we show that this parameter tightly correlates with the peak luminosity, $L_p$. We compare the observed $L_{30}/Lp$-$L_p$ distribution with models from the literature, including non-spherical models consisting of head-on WD collisions and off-centered ignitions of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs. We find that all known SNe Ia models fail to reproduce the observed bolometric luminosity-width correlation.</description>

      <title>Detection of the orbital modulation of Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence emission in Centaurus X-3 using the high-resolution spectrometer Resolve onboard XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line emission in X-ray spectra is a powerful diagnostic tool for various astrophysical objects to reveal the distribution of cold matter around photo-ionizing sources. The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter onboard the \textit{XRISM} satellite will bring new constraints on the emission line. We present one of the first such results for the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3, which is composed of an O-type star and a neutron star (NS). We conducted a 155 ks observation covering an entire binary orbit. A weak Fe K$\alpha$ line was detected in all orbital phases at an equivalent width (EW) of 10--20 eV. We found for the first time that its radial velocity (RV) is sinusoidally modulated by the orbital phase. The RV amplitude is 248 $\pm$ 13 km s$^{-1}$, which is significantly smaller than the value (391 km s$^{-1}$) expected if the emission is from the NS surface, but is consistent if the emission takes place at the O star surface. We discuss several possibilities of the line production site, including the NS surface, O star surface, O star wind, and accretion stream from the O star to the NS. We ran radiative transfer calculation for some of them assuming spherically-symmetric density and velocity profiles and an isotropic distribution of X-ray emission from the NS. None of them explains the observed EW and velocity dispersion dependence on the orbital phase, suggesting that more elaborated modeling is needed. In other words, the present observational results have capability to constrain deviations from these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Singular Spectrum Analysis of Fermi-LAT Blazar Light Curves: A Systematic Search for Periodicity and Trends in the Time Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A majority of blazars exhibit variable emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, observed over various time scales. In particular, discernible periodic patterns are detected in the $\gamma$-ray light curves of a few blazars, such as PG 1553+113, S5 1044+71, and PKS 0426-380. The presence of trends, flares, and noise complicates periodicity detection, requiring careful analysis to determine whether these patterns arise from emission mechanisms or occur by chance. We employ Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for the first time on data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to systematically search for periodicity using 28-day binned light curves. We aim to isolate any potential periodic nature of the emission from trends and noise, reducing uncertainties in revealing periodicity. Additionally, we characterize long-term trends and develop a forecasting algorithm based on SSA to predict future emission behavior. We apply SSA to analyze 494 sources detected by Fermi-LAT, focusing on isolating oscillatory components from trends and noise in their $\gamma$-ray light curves. We compute the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram for oscillatory components extracted by SSA to determine the most significant periods, assessing their local and global significance. Our analysis identifies 46 blazars as potential candidates for quasi-periodic $\gamma$-ray emissions, each with a local significance $\geq 2\sigma$. Notably, 33 exhibit a local significance of $\geq 4\sigma$ (corresponding to a global significance of $\geq 2.2\sigma$). Our findings introduce 25 new $\gamma$-ray candidates, doubling the number of potentially periodic sources. This study provides a foundation for future investigations by identifying promising candidates and their significance in blazar variability.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs I: orbital alignment of highly inclined satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied to the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of black holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc by performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc crossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations $i\in[2^\circ,15^\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake that forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We identify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry of the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake morphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The inclination damping $\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as a power law in $\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\text{H,0}$ as $\Delta i/i \propto m_{\rm H,0}^{0.4} \sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated by the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until accretion effects become comparable at $\sin(i)\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where $H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations ($\sin(i)\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading to a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest that the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only episodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying inclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Link between Fast Radio Burst and Binary Neutron Star Origins with Spaceborne Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is an open question, with observations suggesting that at least some are associated with old stellar populations. It has been proposed that some repeating FRBs may be produced by interactions of the binary neutron star magnetospheres decades to centuries before the coalescence. These systems would also emit centi-Hertz gravitational waves during this period, which can be detectable by space-borne gravitational wave detectors. We explore the prospects of using current and future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as TianQin, LISA, and DECIGO, to test this FRB formation hypothesis. Focusing on nearby galaxies like M81, which hosts a repeating FRB source in a globular cluster, we calculate the detection capabilities for binary neutron star systems. Our analysis reveals that while missions like TianQin and LISA face limitations in horizon distance, changing detector pointing direction could significantly enhance detection probabilities. Considering the chance of a Milky Way-like galaxy coincidentally containing a BNS within 100 years before merger is only $3\times10^{-5}$ to $5\times10^{-3}$, if a signal is detected originating from M81, we can establish the link between FRB and binary neutron stars with a significance level of at least 2.81$\sigma$, or a Bayes factor of $4\times10^6 - 7\times10^8$ / $5\times10^2 - 10^5$ against the background model with optimistic/realistic assumptions. Next-generation detectors such as DECIGO offer enhanced capabilities and should easily detect these systems in M81 and beyond. Our work highlights the critical role of space-borne gravitational wave missions in unraveling FRB origins.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Astronomy Beyond the Standard Model: New Window from Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic (ULB) fields with mass $m_{\phi} \ll 1$~eV often arise in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such fields exist, violent astrophysical events that result in emission of gravitational wave, photon, or neutrino signals could also produce bursts of high-density relativistic ULB fields. Detection of such ULB fields in terrestrial or space-based laboratories correlated with other signals from transient astrophysical events opens a novel avenue for multimessenger astronomy. We show that quantum sensors are particularly well-suited to observe emitted scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like ULB fields coupled to SM. We demonstrate that multimessenger astronomy with ULB fields is possible even when accounting for matter screening effects.</description>
