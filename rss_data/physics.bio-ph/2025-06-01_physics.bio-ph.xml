      <title>Modelling bulk mechanical effects in a planar cellular monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a three-dimensional formulation of the cell vertex model to describe the mechanical properties of a confluent planar monolayer of prismatic cells. Treating cell height as a degree of freedom, we reduce the model to a two-dimensional form. We show how bulk effects, associated with cell volume and total surface area, lead to coupling between energy variations arising from changes in cell apical area and apical perimeter, a feature missing from standard implementations of the two-dimensional vertex model. The model identifies four independent mechanisms by which cells can lose in-plane rigidity, relating to variations in total cell surface area, the strength of lateral adhesion, and constrictive forces at the apical cortex. The model distinguishes bulk from in-plane stresses, and identifies two primary measures of cell shear stress. In the rigid regime, the model shows how lateral crowding in a disordered isolated monolayer can lead to cell elongation towards the monolayer centre. We examine loss of in-plane rigidity in a disordered monolayer and connect isolated patches of stiffness that persist during the rigidity transition to the spectrum of a Laplacian matrix. This approach enables bulk mechanical effects in an epithelium to be captured within a two-dimensional framework.</description>

      <title>Surface waves and axoplasmic pressure waves in action potential propagation: fundamentally different physics or two sides of the same coin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that El Hady and Machta's "surface wave" model describes the same underlying process as the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model introduced earlier by Rvachev.
  Note. We, the authors, contacted A. El Hady and B. Machta for comment on the ideas presented herein. They suggested that we "submit a Matters Arising Letter to Nature Communications and we will be asked to respond in due time." Nature Communications ultimately rejected the manuscript, citing:
  "... Our main criterion for consideration of Matters Arising is the degree to which the piece provides interesting and timely scientific criticism and clarification of a Nature Communications publication. In the present case, while we appreciate the interest of your comments to the community, we do not feel that they advance or clarify understanding of the article in question to the extent required for publication in Nature Communications."
  We are posting the submitted version online in accordance with the journal's submission guidelines, which state:
  "Authors who have had a submission declined are encouraged to post it as an online comment to the paper concerned at the journal's website and/or on an appropriate preprint server."</description>

      <title>Preserved reptile scales retain microscopic features, revealing a new instance of convergent evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale structures on biological surfaces can profoundly impact how animals move, appear, and interact with their environments. Such textures may be especially important for limbless reptiles, such as snakes and legless lizards, because their skin serves as the primary interface with the world around them. Here, we examine ventral microstructures of several limbless reptiles, which are hypothesized to be highly specialized to aid locomotion via frictional interactions. Inspired by prior studies that investigated potential links between microtextures, phylogeny, habitat, and locomotion -- but that were limited by their reliance on shed skins -- we characterized the structures present on preserved museum specimens and found that they are quantitatively similar to those found on shed skins. Using this result, we confirmed a previously hypothesized -- but untested due to the lack of shed skins -- third independent evolution of sidewinding-specific isotropic microtexture. Specifically, we examined a museum-preserved \textit{Bitis peringueyi} specimen and identified a new instance of convergent evolution in sidewinding viper microstructures: the loss of micro-spikes (present on many snake species) and the appearance of micro-pits with a characteristic spacing. Our results reveal that museum-preserved specimens retain intact microtextures, greatly expanding the availability of samples for evolutionary studies.</description>

      <title>Motility-dependent selective transport of active matter in trap arrays: Separation methods based on trapping-detrapping and deterministic lateral displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting active matter based on its motility represents a challenging task, as it requires different approaches than common separation techniques intended for separation based on, e.g., size, shape, density, and flexibility. This motility-based selection is important for, e.g., selecting biological species, such as bacteria or highly motile sperm cells for medically assisted reproduction. Common separation techniques are not applicable for separating species based on motility as such species can have indistinguishable physical properties, i.e., size, shape, density, and differ only by their ability to execute self-propelled motion as, e.g., motile, and immotile sperm cells. Therefore, selecting active species based on motility requires completely different approaches. Some of these have been developed including sperm cell selection techniques, e.g., swim-up techniques, passive selection methods based on the ability of highly motile sperm cells to swim across streamlines, as well as more sophisticated techniques. Here we theoretically demonstrate via numerical simulations various efficient methods of selection and separation based on the motility of active species using arrays of traps. Two approaches are proposed: one allowed the selective escape of motile species from traps, and the other one relying on a deterministic lateral displacement (DLD)-type method. As a model system, we consider self-propelled Janus particles whose motility can be tuned. The resulted separation methods are applicable for separation of biological motile species, such as bacteria or sperm cells, as well as for Janus micro- and nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Role of Aerosol and Exudate Transport in the Diffusion of Lung Infection in Respiratory Infectious Diseases (taking SARS-CoV-2 as an example): A Hypothesis Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hypothetical model for the dual role of respiratory aerosols and inflammatory exudates in the dynamics and progression of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection. Starting from a new paradigm in infectious disease transmission, we reflect on the often-overlooked role of physical transmission media within the host individual. The hypothesis posits that tiny aerosols (including those inhaled externally and those self-generated and re-inhaled by the host) play a crucial role in the initial seeding and early expansion of the infection in the lungs, explaining the multifocal characteristics observed in early CT imaging. As the infection progresses, inflammatory exudates, formed due to lung inflammation, become a new efficient vehicle, driving the large-scale spread of the virus within the lungs and accounting for the development of diffuse lesions. This model reveals a "dynamic equilibrium point" where the dominant mechanism shifts from aerosol-mediated to exudate-mediated spread. Although direct validation of this hypothesis faces ethical and technical challenges, existing clinical imaging, viral kinetics, and epidemiological patterns provide indirect support. The paper also conceptualizes ideal experimental designs and retrospective analyses to validate the hypothesis. Finally, we discuss the implications of this hypothesis for public health practice, emphasizing the importance of improving ventilation in the microenvironment of infected individuals to achieve a "for all, by all" (literally "everyone for me, I for everyone") bidirectional protection. This research aims to provide a new framework for understanding the pathophysiology of respiratory infectious diseases and to offer theoretical basis for developing more cost-effective and broadly applicable intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis of branched cells in complex environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell migration in vivo is often guided by chemical signals. Such chemotaxis, such as performed by immune cells migrating to a wound site, is complicated by the complex geometry inside living tissues. In this study, we extend our theoretical model of branched-cell migration on a network by introducing chemokine sources to explore the cellular response. The model predicts a speed-accuracy tradeoff, whereby slow cells are significantly more accurate and able to follow efficiently a weak chemoattractant signal. We then compare the model's predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and migrating in-vitro inside a regular lattice of pillars. We find that the model captures the details of the sub-cellular response to the chemokine gradient, as well as the large-scale migration response. This comparison suggests that the neutrophils behave as fast cells, compromising their chemotaxis accuracy, which explains the functionality of these immune cells.</description>
