      <title>Double Y-Configuration Multi Active Bridge Converter: A Single Stage Bidirectional AC-DC Converter with Simple Sinusoidal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a double Y-configuration multi active bridge converter (DYAB) capable of single stage bidirectional AC-DC isolated power conversion with a simple sinusoidal phase shift modulation. Compared to other dual active bridge (DAB) based AC-DC converters, the DYAB achieves power factor correction (PFC) with a simpler control method while maintaining nearly full-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and relatively low circulating current, resulting in high efficiency. The paper details the equivalent model and modulation method. A steady-state analysis tool based on the fast fourier transform (FFT) is developed to calculate the ZVS range, PFC performance, and loss breakdown. A 2.66kW hardware test demonstrating an efficiency of 97.14% is implemented to verify the proposed circuit and the steady state model.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Computing for Data Centers with Probabilistic Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21510v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers are significant contributors to carbon emissions and can strain power systems due to their high electricity consumption. To mitigate this impact and to participate in demand response programs, cloud computing companies strive to balance and optimize operations across their global fleets by making strategic decisions about when and where to place compute jobs for execution. In this paper, we introduce a load shaping scheme which reacts to time-varying grid signals by leveraging both temporal and spatial flexibility of compute jobs to provide risk-aware management guidelines and job placement with provable performance guarantees based on distributionally robust optimization. Our approach divides the problem into two key components: (i) day-ahead planning, which generates an optimal scheduling strategy based on historical load data, and (ii) real-time job placement and (time) scheduling, which dynamically tracks the optimal strategy generated in (i). We validate our method in simulation using normalized load profiles from randomly selected Google clusters, incorporating time-varying grid signals. We can demonstrate significant reductions in carbon cost and peak power with our approach compared to myopic greedy policies, while maintaining computational efficiency and abiding to system constraints.</description>

      <title>A Method for Constructing Wavelet Functions on the Real Number Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general method to construct wavelet function on real number ffeld is proposed in this article,which is based on finite length sequence.This finite length sequence is called the seed sequence, and the corresponding wavelet function is called the seed sequence wavelet function.The seed sequence wavelet function is continuous and energy concentrated in both time and frequency domains,That is, it has a finite support set in both time and frequency domains. It is proved that if and only if the seed sequence has 0 mean value, the interpolation function satisfy the admissible condition of wavelet function. The conditions corresponding to the higher order vanishing moment of the seed sequence wavelet function are also given in this article. On this basis, the concept of random wavelet function is proposed, and the condition of the regularity of random wavelet is discussed.</description>

      <title>Addressing Imbalance Risk with Reserves and Flexibility Options: An ERCOT-like Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the role of variable renewables in electricity markets expands, new market products help system operators manage imbalances caused by uncertainty and variability. Whereas work in the last decade has focused on constructing demand curves for central procurement of those products, little attention has been paid to designing their settlement scheme and understanding the connections between the economic value of these products, the schedule of variable resources, and the cost of flexibility. In this article, we compare a new product called Flexibility Options, which addresses these gaps, with a traditional reserve product using a case study similar to the 2019 Texas (ERCOT) system. Our findings suggest that both products are equally effective in managing imbalances, but Flexibility Options have superior risk management properties and keep the system operator revenue adequate.</description>

      <title>Survey of Load-Altering Attacks Against Power Grids: Attack Impact, Detection and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing penetration of IoT devices in power grids despite its benefits, raises cyber security concerns. In particular, load-altering attacks (LAAs) targetting high-wattage IoT-controllable load devices pose serious risks to grid stability and disrupt electricity markets. This paper provides a comprehensive review of LAAs, highlighting the threat model, analyzing its impact on transmission and distribution networks, and the electricity market dynamics. We also review the detection and localization schemes for LAAs that employ either model-based or data-driven approaches, with some hybrid methods combining the strengths of both. Additionally, mitigation techniques are examined, focusing on both preventive measures, designed to thwart attack execution, and reactive methods, which aim to optimize responses to ongoing attacks. We look into the application of each study and highlight potential streams for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Average Predictor-Feedback Control Design for Switched Linear Systems with Time-Dependent Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an input delay-compensating feedback law for linear switched systems with time-dependent switching. Because the future values of the switching signal, which are needed for constructing an exact predictor-feedback law, may be unavailable at current time, the key design challenge is how to construct a proper predictor state. We resolve this challenge constructing an average predictor-based feedback law, which may be viewed as an exact predictor-feedback law for a particular average system without switching. We establish that, under the predictor-based control law introduced, the closed-loop system is exponentially stable, provided that the plant's parameters are sufficiently close to the corresponding parameters of the average system. In particular, the allowable difference is inversely proportional to the size of delay and proportional to the dwell time of the switching signal (no restriction is imposed on the size of delay or dwell time themselves). The stability proof relies on two main ingredients-a Lyapunov functional constructed via backstepping and derivation of solutions' estimates for the difference between the average and the exact predictor states. We present consistent, numerical simulation results, which illustrate the necessity of employing the average predictor-based law for achieving stabilization and desired performance of the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantum Neural Network for Renewable-Rich Power Flow with Training Efficiency and Generalization Capability Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of power flow calculation in large scale power systems with high renewable penetration, focusing on computational efficiency and generalization. Traditional methods, while accurate, struggle with scalability for large power systems. Existing data driven deep learning approaches, despite their speed, require extensive training data and lacks generalization capability in face of unseen scenarios, such as uncertainties of power flow caused by renewables. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel power flow calculation model based on Bayesian Quantum Neural Networks (BQNNs). This model leverages quantum computing's ability to improve the training efficiency. The BQNN is trained using Bayesian methods, enabling it to update its understanding of renewable energy uncertainties dynamically, improving generalization to unseen data. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics: effective dimension for model complexity and generalization error bound to assess the model's performance in unseen scenarios. Our approach demonstrates improved training efficiency and better generalization capability, making it as an effective tool for future steady-state power system analysis.</description>

      <title>PC-Gym: Benchmark Environments For Process Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22093v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PC-Gym is an open-source tool designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for chemical process control problems. It provides a suite of environments that model a range of chemical processes, incorporating nonlinear dynamics, process disturbances, and constraints. Key features include flexible constraint handling mechanisms, customizable disturbance generation, and modular reward function design. The framework enables benchmarking state-of-the-art RL algorithms against a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) oracle across various process control scenarios. Case studies demonstrate PC-Gym's effectiveness in evaluating RL approaches for the control of various chemical engineering systems such as a continuously stirred tank reactor, multistage extraction process, and crystallization reactor. The framework's ability to incorporate realistic disturbances and constraints allows for robust testing of control strategies. Results highlight the performance gaps between RL algorithms and NMPC oracles, demonstrating the utility of PC-Gym for algorithm benchmarking and suggesting areas for improvement in RL-based process control. By offering a standardized platform for developing and assessing RL-based control strategies, PC-Gym aims to accelerate research at the intersection of machine learning and process systems engineering. It bridges the gap between theoretical advancements in RL and practical applications in industrial process control, providing researchers and practitioners with a valuable tool for exploring data-driven control solutions for complex chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of PI and PID Controllers for Level and Flow Control in Coupled Tank Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comparative study of Proportional-Integral (PI) and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers applied to level and flow control in coupled tank systems is presented in this research work. The coupled tank system, characterized by its nonlinear behavior, was selected due to its relevance in chemical processing industries where precision in liquid level control is crucial. The study evaluates the performance of both controllers under varying conditions, focusing on their ability to handle disturbances and maintain stability. Through experimental data and graphical analysis, it was observed that PID controllers, with their derivative action, provide faster response times and higher accuracy but are more sensitive to noise and harder to tune. In contrast, PI controllers, though slower, offer more stability and are easier to configure for systems where precise control is less critical. These findings highlight the trade-offs between the two control strategies, providing insights into their application depending on system requirements.</description>

      <title>Extending Jacobian matrix in proving stability for nonlinear systems with one equilibrium point such as compressor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global stability of the systems has always been vital of importance; however, this concept has not yet been sufficiently developed for the nonlinear systems. This paper extends the Jacobian matrix so that this method be able to seek the criteria to ensure global stability for a special class of nonlinear systems. In this regard, we propose a new analysis method that utilizes the Jacobian matrix concept, integrating with the characteristics of the negative eigenvalues to analyze the global stability of the nonlinear systems with only one equilibrium point. Also, the positive eigenvalue to analyze the global instability of the nonlinear systems with only one equilibrium point. Some theorems such as Hartman-Grobman and Popov criteria can prove this claim. To this end, several examples and a benchmark systems have been intended to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. Results indicate the high potential of the proposed approach in order to develop the global stability analysis. The nonlinear compressor model, categorized in this extensive class, is also investigated as a well-known industrial system besides other several examples. The outcomes demonstrate that extended Jacobian stability analysis can ensure global stability for this class of nonlinear systems under some spatial conditions, discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Digital requirements engineering with an INCOSE-derived SysML meta-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional requirements engineering tools do not readily access the SysML-defined system architecture model, often resulting in ad-hoc duplication of model elements that lacks the connectivity and expressive detail possible in a SysML-defined model. Further integration of requirements engineering activities with MBSE contributes to the Authoritative Source of Truth while facilitating deep access to system architecture model elements for V&amp;V activities. We explore the application of MBSE to requirements engineering by extending the Model-Based Structured Requirement SysML Profile to comply with the INCOSE Guide to Writing Requirements while conforming to the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 standard requirement statement patterns. Rules, Characteristics, and Attributes were defined in SysML according to the Guide to facilitate requirements definition, verification &amp; validation. The resulting SysML Profile was applied in two system architecture models at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, allowing us to assess its applicability and value in real-world project environments. Initial results indicate that INCOSE-derived Model-Based Structured Requirements may rapidly improve requirement expression quality while complementing the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook checklist and guidance, but typical requirement management activities still have challenges related to automation and support in the system architecture modeling software.</description>

      <title>Multiple Ships Cooperative Navigation and Collision Avoidance using Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the real world, unmanned surface vehicles (USV) often need to coordinate with each other to accomplish specific tasks. However, achieving cooperative control in multi-agent systems is challenging due to issues such as non-stationarity and partial observability. Recent advancements in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provide new perspectives to address these challenges. Therefore, we propose using the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm with communication to address multiple ships' cooperation problems under partial observability. We developed two tasks based on OpenAI's gym environment: cooperative navigation and cooperative collision avoidance. In these tasks, ships must not only learn effective control strategies but also establish communication protocols with other agents. We analyze the impact of external noise on communication, the effect of inter-agent communication on performance, and the communication patterns learned by the agents. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively addresses cooperative navigation and collision avoidance among multiple vessels, significantly outperforming traditional single-agent algorithms. Agents establish a consistent communication protocol, enabling them to compensate for missing information through shared observations and achieve better coordination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel switching dynamics that converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of a nonlinear optimisation problem. This new approach is particularly notable for its lower dimensionality compared to conventional primal-dual dynamics, as it focuses exclusively on estimating the primal variable. Our method is successfully illustrated on general quadratic optimisation problems, the minimisation of the classical Rosenbrock function, and a nonconvex optimisation problem stemming from the control of energy-efficient buildings.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation with Unbounded Markovian Noise: A General-Purpose Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by engineering applications such as resource allocation in networks and inventory systems, we consider average-reward Reinforcement Learning with unbounded state space and reward function. Recent works studied this problem in the actor-critic framework and established finite sample bounds assuming access to a critic with certain error guarantees. We complement their work by studying Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation and establishing finite-time bounds with the optimal $\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity. These results are obtained using the following general-purpose theorem for non-linear Stochastic Approximation (SA).
  Suppose that one constructs a Lyapunov function for a non-linear SA with certain drift condition. Then, our theorem establishes finite-time bounds when this SA is driven by unbounded Markovian noise under suitable conditions. It serves as a black box tool to generalize sample guarantees on SA from i.i.d. or martingale difference case to potentially unbounded Markovian noise. The generality and the mild assumption of the setup enables broad applicability of our theorem. We illustrate its power by studying two more systems: (i) We improve upon the finite-time bounds of $Q$-learning by tightening the error bounds and also allowing for a larger class of behavior policies. (ii) We establish the first ever finite-time bounds for distributed stochastic optimization of high-dimensional smooth strongly convex function using cyclic block coordinate descent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain computer interface (BCI) applications in robotics are becoming more famous and famous. People with disabilities are facing a real-time problem of doing simple activities such as grasping, handshaking etc. in order to aid with this problem, the use of brain signals to control actuators is showing a great importance. The Emotive Insight, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) device, is utilized in this project to collect brain signals and transform them into commands for controlling a robotic arm using an Arduino controller. The Emotive Insight captures brain signals, which are subsequently analyzed using Emotive software and connected with Arduino code. The HITI Brain software integrates these devices, allowing for smooth communication between brain activity and the robotic arm. This system demonstrates how brain impulses may be utilized to control external devices directly.

      <title>A Degree of Flowability for Virtual Tubes</title>

Abstract: With the rapid development of robotics swarm technology, there are more tasks that require the swarm to pass through complicate environments safely and efficiently. Virtual tube technology is a novel way to achieve this goal. Virtual tubes are free spaces connecting two places that provide safety boundaries and direction of motion for swarm robotics. How to determine the design quality of a virtual tube is a fundamental problem. For such a purpose, this paper presents a degree of flowability (DOF) for two-dimensional virtual tubes according to a minimum energy principle. After that, methods to calculate DOF are proposed with a feasibility analysis. Simulations of swarm robotics in different kinds of two-dimensional virtual tubes are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method of calculating DOF.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Control of Continua of Linear Hyperbolic PDEs and Application to Stabilization of Large-Scale $n+m$ Coupled Hyperbolic PDE Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a backstepping control design for a class of continuum systems of linear hyperbolic PDEs, described by a coupled system of an ensemble of rightward transporting PDEs and a (finite) system of $m$ leftward transporting PDEs. The key analysis challenge of the design is to establish well-posedness of the resulting ensemble of kernel equations, since they evolve on a prismatic (3-D) domain and inherit the potential discontinuities of the kernels for the case of $n+m$ hyperbolic systems. We resolve this challenge generalizing the well-posedness analysis of Hu, Di Meglio, Vazquez, and Krstic to continua of general, heterodirectional hyperbolic PDE systems, while also constructing a proper Lyapunov functional.
  Since the motivation for addressing such PDE systems continua comes from the objective to develop computationally tractable control designs for large-scale PDE systems, we then introduce a methodology for stabilization of general $n+m$ hyperbolic systems, constructing stabilizing backstepping control kernels based on the continuum kernels derived from the continuum system counterpart. This control design procedure is enabled by establishing that, as $n$ grows, the continuum backstepping control kernels can approximate (in certain sense) the exact kernels, and thus, they remain stabilizing (as formally proven). This approach guarantees that complexity of computation of stabilizing kernels does not grow with the number $n$ of PDE systems components. We further establish that the solutions to the $n+m$ PDE system converge, as $n\to\infty$, to the solutions of the corresponding continuum PDE system.
  We also provide a numerical example in which the continuum kernels can be obtained in closed form (in contrast to the large-scale kernels), thus resulting in minimum complexity of control kernels computation, which illustrates the potential computational benefits of our approach.</description>

      <title>LipKernel: Lipschitz-Bounded Convolutional Neural Networks via Dissipative Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel layer-wise parameterization for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that includes built-in robustness guarantees by enforcing a prescribed Lipschitz bound. Each layer in our parameterization is designed to satisfy a linear matrix inequality (LMI), which in turn implies dissipativity with respect to a specific supply rate. Collectively, these layer-wise LMIs ensure Lipschitz boundedness for the input-output mapping of the neural network, yielding a more expressive parameterization than through spectral bounds or orthogonal layers. Our new method LipKernel directly parameterizes dissipative convolution kernels using a 2-D Roesser-type state space model. This means that the convolutional layers are given in standard form after training and can be evaluated without computational overhead. In numerical experiments, we show that the run-time using our method is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art Lipschitz-bounded networks that parameterize convolutions in the Fourier domain, making our approach particularly attractive for improving robustness of learning-based real-time perception or control in robotics, autonomous vehicles, or automation systems. We focus on CNNs, and in contrast to previous works, our approach accommodates a wide variety of layers typically used in CNNs, including 1-D and 2-D convolutional layers, maximum and average pooling layers, as well as strided and dilated convolutions and zero padding. However, our approach naturally extends beyond CNNs as we can incorporate any layer that is incrementally dissipative.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Relaxation based Non-Conservative Chance Constrained Stochastic MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chance constrained stochastic model predictive controllers (CC-SMPC) trade off full constraint satisfaction for economical plant performance under uncertainty. Previous CC-SMPC works are over-conservative in constraint violations leading to worse economic performance. Other past works require a-priori information about the uncertainty set, limiting their application. This paper considers a discrete LTI system with hard constraints on inputs and chance constraints on states, with unknown uncertainty distribution, statistics, or samples. This work proposes a novel adaptive online update rule to relax the state constraints based on the time-average of past constraint violations, to achieve reduced conservativeness in closed-loop. Under an ideal control policy assumption, it is proven that the time-average of constraint violations asymptotically converges to the maximum allowed violation probability. The method is applied for optimal battery energy storage system (BESS) dispatch in a grid connected microgrid with PV generation and load demand, with chance constraints on BESS state-of-charge (SOC). Realistic simulations show the superior electricity cost saving potential of the proposed method as compared to the traditional economic MPC without chance constraints, and a state-of-the-art approach with chance constraints. We satisfy the chance constraints non-conservatively in closed-loop, effectively trading off increased cost savings with minimal adverse effects on BESS lifetime.</description>

Abstract: In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.</description>

      <title>Safe stabilization using generalized Lyapunov barrier function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the safe stabilization problem, focusing on controlling the system state to the origin while avoiding entry into unsafe state sets. The current methods for solving this issue rely on smooth Lyapunov and barrier functions, which do not always ensure the existence of an effective controller even when such smooth functions are created. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the concept of a generalized (nonsmooth) Lyapunov barrier function (GenLBF), which guarantees the existence of a safe and stable controller. We outline a systematic approach for constructing a GenLBF, including a technique for efficiently calculating the upper generalized derivative of the GenLBF. Using the constructed GenLBF, we propose a method for certifying safe stabilization of autonomous systems and design a piecewise continuous feedback control to achieve safe stabilization of non-autonomous systems. A general controller refinement strategy is further proposed to help the state trajectory escape from undesired local points occurring in systems with special physical structure. A thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in addressing the safe stabilization problem for systems with single or multiple bounded unsafe state sets. Extensive simulations of linear and nonlinear systems further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method and its superiority over the smooth control Lyapunov barrier function method.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between Geometric Frequency and Lagrange Derivative</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper shows the equivalence between the geometric frequency of an electric quantity, namely, voltage and current, and the Lagrange derivative of a stream-line of a fluid. The geometric frequency is a concept recently proposed by the author and is a generalization of the instantaneous frequency, a quantity that is particularly important for the analysis and the control of electric power systems. On the other hand, the Lagrange derivative is mostly utilized in fluid dynamics and helps decomposing the time derivative into various components. The paper shows how these components relate to the elements of the geometric frequency. The paper also shows, through a variety of numerical examples, how the decomposition of the Lagrange derivative helps identifying the distortion of the waveform of a measured electric quantity and how this information can be utilized to classify system operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Bayesian Filtering with Natural Gradient Gaussian Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical Bayes filters often assume the state distribution of each time step to be Gaussian for computational tractability, resulting in the so-called Gaussian filters. When facing nonlinear systems, Gaussian filters such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) or unscented Kalman filter (UKF) typically rely on certain linearization techniques, which can introduce large estimation errors. To address this issue, this paper reconstructs the prediction and update steps of Gaussian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization problems, whose optimal conditions are found to have analytical forms from Stein's lemma. It is observed that the stationary point for the prediction step requires calculating the first two moments of the prior distribution, which is equivalent to that step in existing moment-matching filters. In the update step, instead of linearizing the model to approximate the stationary points, we propose an iterative approach to directly minimize the update step's objective to avoid linearization errors. For the purpose of performing the steepest descent on the Gaussian manifold, we derive its natural gradient that leverages Fisher information matrix to adjust the gradient direction, accounting for the curvature of the parameter space. Combining this update step with moment matching in the prediction step, we introduce a new iterative filter for nonlinear systems called \textit{N}atural Gr\textit{a}dient Gaussia\textit{n} Appr\textit{o}ximation filter, or NANO filter for short. We prove that NANO filter locally converges to the optimal Gaussian approximation at each time step. Furthermore, the estimation error is proven exponentially bounded for nearly linear measurement equation and low noise levels through constructing a supermartingale-like property across consecutive time steps.</description>

      <title>C-GAIL: Stabilizing Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning with Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) trains a generative policy to mimic a demonstrator. It uses on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a reward signal derived from a GAN-like discriminator. A major drawback of GAIL is its training instability - it inherits the complex training dynamics of GANs, and the distribution shift introduced by RL. This can cause oscillations during training, harming its sample efficiency and final policy performance. Recent work has shown that control theory can help with the convergence of a GAN's training. This paper extends this line of work, conducting a control-theoretic analysis of GAIL and deriving a novel controller that not only pushes GAIL to the desired equilibrium but also achieves asymptotic stability in a 'one-step' setting. Based on this, we propose a practical algorithm 'Controlled-GAIL' (C-GAIL). On MuJoCo tasks, our controlled variant is able to speed up the rate of convergence, reduce the range of oscillation and match the expert's distribution more closely both for vanilla GAIL and GAIL-DAC.</description>

      <title>Blue and Green-Mode Energy-Efficient Nanoparticle-Based Chemiresistive Sensor Array Realized by Rapid Ensemble Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates the development of optimized nanoparticle-based Chemiresistive Sensor (CRS) arrays that are energy-efficient, specific, and sensitive. This study introduces an optimization strategy that employs a rapid ensemble learning-based model committee approach to achieve these goals. Utilizing machine learning models such as Elastic Net Regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost, among others, the strategy identifies the most impactful sensors in a CRS array for accurate classification. A weighted voting mechanism is introduced to aggregate the models' opinions in sensor selection, thereby setting up two distinct working modes, termed "Blue" and "Green". The Blue mode operates with all sensors for maximum detection capability, while the Green mode selectively activates only key sensors, significantly reducing energy consumption without compromising detection accuracy. The strategy is validated through theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy. The employed optimization strategy elevates the detection capability of CRS arrays while also pushing it closer to theoretical limits, promising significant implications for the development of low-cost, easily fabricable next-generation IoT sensor terminals.</description>

      <title>Fully Decentralized Task Offloading in Multi-Access Edge Computing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of task offloading in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems constituting $N$ devices assisted by an edge server (ES), where the devices can split task execution between a local processor and the ES. Since the local task execution and communication with the ES both consume power, each device must judiciously choose between the two. We model the problem as a large population non-cooperative game among the $N$ devices. Since computation of an equilibrium in this scenario is difficult due to the presence of a large number of devices, we employ the mean-field game framework to reduce the finite-agent game problem to a generic user's multi-objective optimization problem, with a coupled consistency condition. By leveraging the novel age of information (AoI) metric, we invoke techniques from stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) theory and study the tradeoffs between increasing information freshness and reducing power consumption. In numerical simulations, we validate that a higher load at the ES may lead devices to upload their task to the ES less often.</description>

      <title>ECLipsE: Efficient Compositional Lipschitz Constant Estimation for Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lipschitz constant plays a crucial role in certifying the robustness of neural networks to input perturbations. Since calculating the exact Lipschitz constant is NP-hard, efforts have been made to obtain tight upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant. Typically, this involves solving a large matrix verification problem, the computational cost of which grows significantly for both deeper and wider networks. In this paper, we provide a compositional approach to estimate Lipschitz constants for deep feed-forward neural networks. We first obtain an exact decomposition of the large matrix verification problem into smaller sub-problems. Then, leveraging the underlying cascade structure of the network, we develop two algorithms. The first algorithm explores the geometric features of the problem and enables us to provide Lipschitz estimates that are comparable to existing methods by solving small semidefinite programs (SDPs) that are only as large as the size of each layer. The second algorithm relaxes these sub-problems and provides a closed-form solution to each sub-problem for extremely fast estimation, altogether eliminating the need to solve SDPs. The two algorithms represent different levels of trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach provides a steep reduction in computation time (as much as several thousand times faster, depending on the algorithm for deeper networks) while yielding Lipschitz bounds that are very close to or even better than those achieved by state-of-the-art approaches in a broad range of experiments. In summary, our approach considerably advances the scalability and efficiency of certifying neural network robustness, making it particularly attractive for online learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Constrained Optimization with Compressed Gradients: A Dynamical Systems Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient compression is of growing interests for solving constrained optimization problems including compressed sensing, noisy recovery and matrix completion under limited communication resources and storage costs. Convergence analysis of these methods from the dynamical systems viewpoint has attracted considerable attention because it provides a geometric demonstration towards the shadowing trajectory of a numerical scheme. In this work, we establish a tight connection between a continuous-time nonsmooth dynamical system called a perturbed sweeping process (PSP) and a projected scheme with compressed gradients. Theoretical results are obtained by analyzing the asymptotic pseudo trajectory of a PSP. We show that under mild assumptions a projected scheme converges to an internally chain transitive invariant set of the corresponding PSP. Furthermore, given the existence of a Lyapunov function $V$ with respect to a set $\Lambda$, convergence to $\Lambda$ can be established if $V(\Lambda)$ has an empty interior. Based on these theoretical results, we are able to provide a useful framework for convergence analysis of projected methods with compressed gradients. Moreover, we propose a provably convergent distributed compressed gradient descent algorithm for distributed nonconvex optimization. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the validity of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>
