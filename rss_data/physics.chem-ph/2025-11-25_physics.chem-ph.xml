      <title>$\Delta$-ML Ensembles for Selecting Quantum Chemistry Methods to Compute Intermolecular Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum chemical methods for accurately computing interactions between molecules have a wide range of applications but are often computationally expensive. Hence, selecting an appropriate method based on accuracy and computational cost remains a significant challenge due to varying performance of methods. In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $\Delta$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $\Delta$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $\Delta$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Hartree-Fock and DFT for Molecular Hyperpolarizability: Implications for Evolutionary Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms for molecular design require computationally efficient yet accurate fitness functions. We systematically benchmark Hartree-Fock and density functional theory for predicting molecular first hyperpolarizability ($\beta$), evaluating five functionals (HF, PBE0, B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, M06-2X) across six basis sets against experimental data from five organic push-pull chromophores. For this dataset, HF/3-21G achieves 45.5% mean absolute percentage error with perfect pairwise ranking in 7.4 minutes per molecule. All 30 tested combinations of functional and basis sets maintain perfect pairwise agreement, validating their use as evolutionary fitness functions despite moderate absolute errors. Larger basis sets yield a lower percentage error compared to the experimental values than the difference with the functional. The preservation of pairwise rankings across all combinations of functionals and basis sets provides crucial guidance for evolutionary optimization of nonlinear optical materials.</description>

      <title>Unbiased molecular dynamics for the direct determination of catalytic reaction times : paving the way beyond transition state theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study address the computational determination of catalytic reaction rates by moving beyond traditional Transition State Theory (TST), addressing its limitations in complex systems. The Hill relation framework, integrated with Adaptive Multilevel Splitting (AMS), offers exact rate constants for stochastic dynamics, overcoming TST's assumptions and limitations such as recrossings and post-transition state bifurcations. Two case studies validate the approach: water formation on {\gamma}-alumina and protonated isobutanol dehydration in the gas phase, demonstrating consistency with DFT results and highlighting the importance of dynamical effects. This framework provides a robust, computationally feasible methodology for studying complex catalytic processes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Spin-Orbital Entanglement in $5d^1$ Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbital entanglement in $5d^1$ transition metal ions embedded in double perovskites, where anomalous effective magnetic dipole moments are frequently observed, is quantified by the spin-orbital von Neumann entropy $\Delta S_{\rm vN}^{\rm SO}$. The framework is grounded on the relativistic crystal field theory, and is illustrated through a series of quantum materials: $A_2{\rm TaCl}_6$ ($A = {\rm K}, {\rm Rb}$), $A_2{\rm MgReO}_6$ ($A = {\rm Ca}, {\rm Sr}, {\rm Ba}$) and ${\rm Ba_2NaOsO_6}$, all analyzed in their paramagnetic phases, alongside the ${\rm ReF_6}$ molecular system. The entropies are derived from measurements of the optical $d$-$d$ transitions $\Gamma_7(t_{2g})\leftarrow\Gamma_8(t_{2g})$ and $\Gamma_8(e_g)\leftarrow\Gamma_8(t_{2g})$, and of the effective magnetic dipole moment $\mu_{\rm eff}$. It is demonstrated that, regardless of the system, the Kramers doublet $\Gamma_7(t_{2g})$ exhibits no spin-orbital von Neumann entropy. The entropies obtained for the relativistic crystal field states $\Gamma_8(t_{2g})$ and $\Gamma_8(e_g)$ uncover that, a larger effective magnetic dipole moment can be attributed to a grater spin-orbital entanglement, yet paradoxically not to a larger spin-orbit coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Analytical Excited-State Gradients and Derivative Couplings in TDDFT with Minimal Auxiliary Basis Set Approximation and GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating excited-state gradients and derivative couplings using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) remains a computationally demanding task. An efficient variant, TDDFT with resolution of the identity and a minimal auxiliary basis (TDDFT-ris), has been developed to accelerate excitation energy calculations. However, the formulation and implementation of analytical derivatives for this method have not yet been reported. In this work, we present an implementation of analytical excited-state gradients and derivative couplings within the TDDFT-ris framework. Benchmark calculations on medium-sized organic molecules demonstrate a two- to three-fold speedup for both gradients and derivative couplings compared to standard TDDFT. The accuracy of the TDDFT-ris approach is assessed for gradient-dependent applications, including geometry optimizations, emission energy calculations, and the localization of minimum-energy crossing points. Overall, the TDDFT-ris method provides reliable approximations for most cases, with noticeable errors mainly occurring in derivative couplings between nearly degenerate states.</description>

      <title>Neural network approximation of regularized density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory is one of the most efficient and widely used computational methods of quantum mechanics, especially in fields such as solid state physics and quantum chemistry. From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.</description>

      <title>\emph{Ab initio} derivation of the crystal field parameters for lanthanide ions: The f$^1$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal field theory as explained by Abragam and Bleaney in their landmark 1970 book on transition-ion electron paramagnetic resonance remains a cornerstone in the development of luminescence applications and molecular magnets based on the $f$-elements. The modern numerical derivation of the 27 $B_k^q$ Stevens crystal field parameters (CFPs), which describe the splitting of the energy levels of a central ion, is traditionally achieved through the effective Hamiltonian theory and multiconfiguration wavefunction theory calculations, insofar as the lowest $J$ level fully captures the targeted low-energy physics. In this work, we present a novel theoretical approach for determining the CFPs. The procedure resembles the traditional extraction path but crucially accounts for the full $\ket{J,M_J}$ space of an ion configuration with $L=3$ and $S=\nicefrac{1}{2}$. By demonstrating the extraction procedure using the simplest case of a Ce$^\text{III}$ 4f$^1$ ion with a crystal-field split $J \in \{\nicefrac{5}{2}, \nicefrac{7}{2}\}$ manifold, it is shown for the first time that a unique set of CFPs describes the splitting and mixing both the $J$ manifolds. In fact, this $J/J^\prime$ mixing is analogous to the ``spin mixing'' in binuclear transition metal complexes. At the employed level of calculation, we demonstrate that there is no spin-orbit coupling influence on the CFP values, contrary to previous beliefs. This work represents the first step of a larger effort in reviewing the theory and extraction procedures of CFPs in f-element complexes.</description>

      <title>Tuning Domain-Based Charge Transfer in Organic Dyes: Impact of Heteroatom Doping in the pi-linker of Carbazole-Based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an innovative computational study of domain-based charge transfer that leverages the localized orbitals of pair Coupled Cluster Doubles (pCCD). This method enables both directional monitoring and quantitative assessment of charge transfer among donor (D), bridge (B), and acceptor (A) moieties. We applied this approach to a series of newly designed carbazole-based prototypical organic dyes, doping the bridge at positions 1, 2, and 3 with nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms to generate mono-, di-, and tri-doped variants. Our results demonstrate a clear and progressive enhancement in charge transfer as the degree of nitrogen or oxygen doping increases from mono- to di- to tri-doped systems. For mono-doped dyes, the highest forward charge transfer from donor to bridge to acceptor (D$\xrightarrow{}$B$\xrightarrow{}$A) occurs when a heteroatom (N or O) is placed in the terminal ring of the bridge, closer to the acceptor. In di-doped dyes, the largest forward charge transfer is observed when heteroatoms occupy both terminal positions, with one atom (N or S) adjacent to the donor and the other (N) near the acceptor. Nitrogen-doped systems consistently outperform their oxygen and sulfur counterparts. Among all variants, the organic dye doped with three nitrogen atoms at the bridge exhibits the most efficient and highest directional donor-to-acceptor charge transfer (42.6\%), making it the most promising candidate for potential applications in dye-sensitized solar cells. Finally, our calculations predict weak charge separation in all systems, indicating that charge transfer predominantly occurs from the bridge to the acceptor.</description>

      <title>CHAOS - A Consistent Large-scale Database for Sigma-Profiles and Other Molecular Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sigma-profiles obtained from quantum-chemical calculations are key molecular descriptors for solvent selection, thermodynamic modeling, and data-driven molecular design. However, existing sigma-profile libraries are limited in size and inconsistent in quality, which restricts their utility. In this work, we introduce CHAOS (Computed High-Accuracy Observables and Sigma Profiles), a large-scale and internally consistent database providing sigma-profiles for 53091 molecules, along with additional quantum-chemical observables including gas-phase geometries, single-point conductor-like polarizable continuum (C-PCM) data, infrared spectra, ideal-gas heat capacities and entropies, and atomic orbital nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding tensors. All data were generated using a standardized quantum-chemical workflow based on an wB97X-D/def2-TZVP level of theory. The CHAOS database covers molecules composed of a diverse set of elements, with molar masses up to 400 amu and dipole moments up to 15 D, and is freely available on Zenodo under an open license. It extends the number of molecules for which sigma-profiles are publicly available by more than an order of magnitude and systematically links them to a broad range of other quantum-chemical molecular descriptors. CHAOS provides a comprehensive and consistent foundation for developing models of molecular and thermodynamic properties -- both physics-based and machine-learning approaches -- across chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science, greatly extending the possibilities and the available quantum-chemical data basis.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witnesses of Condensation for Enhanced Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</description>

      <title>The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm with qutrits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, which is well-studied in the qubit framework, to its qutrit counterpart (which we call qutrit HHL, as opposed to qubit HHL, which is HHL using qubits). We design the circuit for the algorithm and develop a program for its implementation. We test HHL with qutrits for simple matrices and verify the results against the expected outcomes. We apply the algorithm to quantum chemistry, and in particular, to the potential energy curve calculations of the model problem of the hydrogen molecule in the split valence basis. We compare the number of qudits and the number of gates required between qubit and qutrit HHL implementations. In general, we find that for a fixed precision, the qutrit HHL circuit requires fewer number of qudits and comparable number of two-qudit gates than its qubit counterpart.</description>

      <title>Fewest switches surface hopping with decoherence in the Marcus inverted regime: correct rates but wrong thermal populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) is a well benchmarked dynamical method for simulating nonadiabatic systems. In particular, the literature shows that for the spin-Boson model Hamiltonian, FSSH with appropriate corrections usually captures the detailed balance well and obtains rate constants within a factor of 2 compared to numerically exact results. In this study, we show that in the deep inverted Marcus regime, the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH, one version that includes decoherence) yields reasonably accurate rate constants but incorrect thermal populations over a broad range of parameters. We present an analytical derivation to understand the AFSSH behavior, and therefore, show that AFSSH obtains correct rate constants owing to the resonance of the time derivative coupling with the exothermicity, but obtains an incorrect thermal population owing to the self-consistency issue. The presented derivation provides an analytical expression for the quantum correction factor for AFSSH simulations in the Marcus inverted regime.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on excited states of ICl+ molecular ion considering spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of the ICl+ molecular ion is investigated by using high-level multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method. To improve computational accuracy, Davidson corrections, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and core-valence electron correlations effects are incorporated into the calculations. The potential energy curves (PECs) of 21 electronic states associated with the two lowest dissociation limits are obtained. The dipole moments (DMs) of the 21 electronic states of ICl+ are systematically studied, and the variations of DMs of the identical symmetry state in the avoided crossing regions are elucidated by analyzing the dominant electronic configuration. With the help of the calculated SOC matrix element, the interaction between crossing states can be elucidated. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements involving the several states are calculated. By analyzing potential energy curves of these states and the nearby electronic states, the possible predissociation channels are provided. Based on the computed PECs, the spectroscopic constants of bound states are determined. The comparison of the spectroscopic constants including and excluding SOC effect indicates that the SOC effect has an obvious correction to the spectroscopic properties of low-lying states. Finally, the transition properties between excited states and the ground state are studied. Based on the computed transition dipole moments and Franck-Condon Factors, radiative lifetimes for the low-lying vibrational levels of excited states are evaluated.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Interfaces at Constant Potential: Data-Efficient Transfer Learning for Machine-Learning-Based Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating electrified metal/water interfaces with explicit solvent under constant potential is essential for understanding electrochemical processes, yet remains prohibitively expensive with ab initio methods. We present TRECI, a data-efficient workflow for constructing machine learning force-fields (ML-FFs) that achieve ab initio-level accuracy in electronically grand-canonical molecular dynamics. By leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose and domain-specific models, TRECI enables stable and accurate simulations across a wide potential range using a reduced number of reference configurations. This efficiency allows the use of high-level meta-GGA functionals and rigorous surface-electrification schemes. Applied to Cu(111)/water, models trained on just one thousand configurations yield accurate molecular dynamics simulations, capturing bias-dependent solvent restructuring effects not previously reported. TRECI offers a general strategy for characterising diverse materials and interfacial chemistries, significantly lowering the cost of realistic constant-potential simulations and expanding access to quantitative electrochemical modelling.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Driven Workflow for Accelerating Design of Novel Photosensitizers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance photosensitizers has long been hindered by the time-consuming and resource-intensive nature of traditional trial-and-error approaches. Here, we present \textbf{A}I-\textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{P}hoto\textbf{S}ensitizer \textbf{I}nnovation (AAPSI), a closed-loop workflow that integrates expert knowledge, scaffold-based molecule generation, and Bayesian optimization to accelerate the design of novel photosensitizers. The scaffold-driven generation in AAPSI ensures structural novelty and synthetic feasibility, while the iterative AI-experiment loop accelerates the discovery of novel photosensitizers. AAPSI leverages a curated database of 102,534 photosensitizer-solvent pairs and generate 6,148 synthetically accessible candidates. These candidates are screened via graph transformers trained to predict singlet oxygen quantum yield ($\phi_\Delta$) and absorption maxima ($\lambda_{max}$), following experimental validation. This work generates several novel candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), among which the hypocrellin-based candidate HB4Ph exhibits exceptional performance at the Pareto frontier of high quantum yield of singlet oxygen and long absorption maxima among current photosensitizers ($\phi_\Delta$=0.85, $\lambda_{max}$=650nm).</description>

      <title>Boundary values for the charge transferred during an electronic transition: insights from matrix analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.13465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution we start by proving and generalizing a conjecture that has been established few decades ago, relating the value of the integral of the detachment/attachment density in two pictures - one accounting for transition-induced basis relaxation and one which does not account for such a relaxation. To this end, we show that it is possible to follow two ways: one combines Haynsworth and Courant-Fischer theorems with a corollary to Lidskii-Wielandt theorem, the other combines two twin theorems extending Cauchy's interlacing theorem, together with the abovementioned corollary to Lidskii-Wielandt theorem. These derivations allow us to provide an upper bound for the electronic charge that is effectively displaced during the molecular electronic transition from one electronic quantum state to another. This quantity can be regarded as the neat charge that has been transferred during the transition. Our derivations ultimately show that this boundary value can be determined from a simple singular value decomposition and at most two matrix trace-computing operations.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Core-Valence-Separated Molecular Mean-Field Exact-Two-Component Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster Theory: Applications to L-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: L-edge X-ray absorption spectra for first-row transition metal complexes are obtained from relativistic equation-of-motion singles and doubles coupled-cluster (EOM-CCSD) calculations that make use of the core-valence separation (CVS) scheme, with scalar and spin--orbit relativistic effects modeled within the molecular mean-field exact two-component (X2C) framework. By incorporating relativistic effects variationally at the Dirac--Coulomb--Breit (DCB) reference level, this method delivers accurate predictions of L-edge features, including energy shifts, intensity ratios, and fine-structure splittings, across a range of molecular systems. Benchmarking against perturbative spin--orbit treatments and relativistic TDDFT highlights the superior performance and robustness of the CVS-DCB-X2C-EOM-CCSD approach, including the reliability of basis set recontraction schemes. While limitations remain in describing high-density spectral regions, our results establish CVS-DCB-X2C-EOM-CCSD as a powerful and broadly applicable tool for relativistic core-excitation spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>In situ 2D visualization of hydrogen entry into Zn-coated steels in NaCl solutions: Roles of Zn dissolution and potential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrogen entry behavior of a partially Zn-coated steel sheet in NaCl solutions was investigated employing a polyaniline-based hydrogenochromic sensor, electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests, and potential measurements using a scanning Kelvin probe. While the Zn coating mitigated corrosion of the steel substrate, it simultaneously accelerated the hydrogen entry. The hydrogen entry occurred at the bare steel surface regions exposed to the NaCl solution, with the hydrogen flux exhibiting non-uniform distribution: higher near the dissolving Zn coating. While no significant differences in Zn dissolution behavior or galvanic current were observed between 0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl solutions, the total hydrogen flux decreased with decreasing Cl ion concentration. This reduction was attributed to a potential gradient induced by differences in electrolyte conductivity. The results demonstrate that potential distribution, rather than galvanic current, is a dominant factor influencing hydrogen entry under the investigated conditions.</description>

      <title>SynTwins: A Retrosynthesis-Guided Framework for Synthesizable Molecular Analog Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational discovery of drugs and materials. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecule design framework that finds synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemists' strategies in three steps: retrosynthesis, searching similar building blocks, and virtual synthesis. Using a search algorithm instead of a stochastic data-driven generator, SynTwins outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models at exploring synthetically accessible analogs while maintaining high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when integrated into existing molecular property-optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach produces synthetically feasible analogs with minimal loss in property scores. Our comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Natural Excitation Framework for Defining the External Space: Uncontracted and Internally Contracted Multireference Nonorthogonal Wavefunction Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this communication, we examine new formalisms for the construction of the external space when correlating reference wavefunctions built from nonorthogonal determinant expansions. Defining the external space in nonorthogonal approaches is challenging, as every substitution from the reference wavefunction can potentially mix both internal and external configurations. As a result, post-nonorthogonal methods are plagued by internal contamination and linear dependencies in the external space, which may lead to correlation double counting that results from overlap of the external and reference spaces. Removal of these internal configurations and orthonormalization of the excited space basis can be computationally expensive. In particular, as the excitation operators cannot be subdivided by their action on orbital subspaces, the external space cannot be partitioned into non-overlapping subsets as is possible in orthogonal methods. To resolve these issues, we propose both uncontracted and internally-contracted approaches based on a natural excitation framework that allows for reduced scaling, more straightforward separation of excitation types that lead to external and internal spaces, and allows for a facile translation of orthogonal methods to a nonorthogonal framework. Several proofs and a numerical demonstration using vanadium monohydride (VH) are provided to illustrate the viability of the proposed approach, using a method-agnostic presentation to highlight the generality of the approach.</description>

      <title>Looking Inside the Widom Region: Non-Equilibrium Stratification in Supercritical CO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supercritical state of matter is usually described as a continuous phase without sharp boundaries between liquid and gas regions. However, under non-equilibrium conditions, this view breaks down. Here we report an experimental investigation of non-equilibrium fluctuations in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) subjected to a stabilising temperature gradient. Using shadowgraphy, we reveal spontaneous stratification of the fluid into different layers, separated by transition regions, where thermodynamic properties vary dramatically. These signatures are particularly evident when the system crosses the Widom lines, loci of the extrema of the response function in the supercritical domain. The analysis of the intermediate scattering function of temperature fluctuations highlights the presence of Brunt-Vaisala oscillations within the fluid at multiple frequencies. These oscillations arise from the coupling of thermal and viscous modes under gravity and are a clear signature of the layered structure of the fluid. Our approach enables systematic exploration of a wide range of thermodynamic conditions in a single experiment. These findings suggest that the Widom region cannot be described as a homogeneous phase, but rather as a dynamic assembly of phase-like behaviours, challenging the applicability of classical thermodynamics in non-equilibrium supercritical regimes.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Hydrogen Embrittlement for the Controllable Synthesis of Functional Hydrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal hydrides are promising solid-state carriers for the integrated hydrogen economy, which is essential for achieving carbon neutrality. However, their conventional synthesis relies on external sources of high-purity H2, thereby linking storage directly to energy-intensive production processes. Here, we transform this paradigm by introducing an acid-mediated "controllable hydrogen embrittlement" strategy for the direct and efficient synthesis and functionalization of metal hydrides under mild conditions. This approach leverages in situ hydrogen generation and defect engineering during the reaction of bulk metals with acid, enabling the preparation of over 20 high-purity hydrides. Using diamond anvil cell experiments, we establish a quantitative criterion, |Delta Peq| &gt; Delta Pph, which reveals the key mechanism governing hydride formation and stability, and guides the synthesis of challenging targets such as LiH. This method not only significantly lowers the energy footprint and economic cost of hydride synthesis by eliminating the need for high-pressure H2 and enabling the use of renewable feedstocks but also creates defect-rich, active hydrides. As a demonstration, an engineered titanium hydride achieves an outstanding current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for NH3 in the nitrate electroreduction reaction, while maintaining consistently high performance across a wide operating window, showcasing the stability conferred by enhanced H- transport. This work redefines hydrogen embrittlement as a powerful tool for synthesis and functionalization, establishing a material platform that integrates hydrogen capture, storage, and conversion, and thereby opening a novel pathway to unify the fragmented hydrogen energy chain.</description>

      <title>General-Purpose Models for the Chemical Sciences: LLMs and Beyond</title>

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in conventional machine learning approaches. A new class of models, which can be summarized under the term general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, has shown the ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent and emerging applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process. While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Efficient $GW$ band structure calculations using Gaussian basis functions and application to atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a $GW$ space-time algorithm for periodic systems in a Gaussian basis including spin-orbit coupling. We employ lattice summation to compute the irreducible density response and the self-energy, while we employ $k$-point sampling for computing the screened Coulomb interaction. Our algorithm enables accurate and computationally efficient quasiparticle band structure calculations for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. For monolayer MoS$_\text{2}$, MoSe$_\text{2}$, WS$_\text{2}$, and WSe$_\text{2}$, computed $GW$ band gaps agree on average within 50 meV with plane-wave-based reference calculations. $G_0W_0$ band structures are obtained in less than two days on a laptop (Intel i5, 192 GB RAM) or in less than 30 minutes using 1024 cores. Overall, our work provides an efficient and scalable framework for $GW$ calculations on atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. Using molecular dynamics, we show our MACE potential is stable, reactive, and generalizes beyond training data to model HAT barriers in collagen I. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.</description>
