      <title>EpiClim: Weekly District-Wise all-India multi-epidemics Climate-Health Dataset for accelerated GeoHealth research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change significantly impacts public health, driving the emergence and spread of epidemics. Climate health models are essential for assessing and predicting disease outbreaks influenced by climatic variables like temperature and precipitation. For instance, dengue and malaria correlate with temperature changes, while cholera is linked to precipitation anomalies. Advances in AI-enabled weather prediction (AI-NWP) have improved forecasting, but integrating climate models with health systems is hindered by the lack of comprehensive, granular health datasets. This study introduces EpiClim: India's Epidemic-Climate Dataset, the first weekly district-wise dataset for major epidemics in India from 2009 to the present, sourced from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). The dataset, covering diseases like dengue, malaria, and acute-diarrheal disease, bridges the gap between climate and health data, enabling the integration of climate forecasts with epidemic prediction models. This work lays the foundation for coupling predictive climate health models with weather and climate models, advancing efforts to mitigate climate-induced public health crises.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Covid-19 Lockdown on Human Behaviour Using Analytical Hierarchy Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronavirus pandemic corresponds to a serious global health crisis which not only changed the way people used to live but also how people behaved in their daily lives. Information from social and behavioural sciences can help in modifying human behaviour to comply with the recommendations of health officials, as the pandemic requires large-scale behaviour change and puts significant mental stress on individuals. The aim of this paper is to examine the changes in human behaviour brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a global health crisis and altered the way people live and interact. The collection of data has been done through online mode and the behaviour of the people is observed, and the results were finally analysed using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) which is a multi-criteria decision-making method to rank the factors that had the greatest impact on the changes in human behaviour. During the study, parameters taken under consideration were the ones which were most likely to affect the human behaviour as an impact of COVID-19 lockdown on health, relationship with family and friends, overall lifestyle, online education and work from home, screen time etc. The paper explains each criterion and how it affected human behaviour the most.</description>

      <title>Ineffectiveness of Alien Terms Interference in a Culture of Multilingual Counties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language serves as a foundation of cultural identity, deeply entangled with the social and historical contexts of a community. This paper examines the ineffectiveness of interference by alien words within a culture. Drawing on sociolinguistic theories and case studies from diverse linguistic environments, it is argued that the forced introduction or adoption of foreign lexicon often fails to achieve its intended socio-cultural objectives. Instead, indigenous languages demonstrate resilience, adapting to or resisting external influences through unique strategies. The effectiveness of this research highlights the futility of attempting to impose linguistic uniformity and underscores the importance of understanding local cultural dynamics in preserving linguistic heritage. This pure language understanding directly relates to translation knowledge where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words because there are different local and internal words like food, garment, cultural and traditional words, and others in every notion. Truly, most of these words do not have an equivalent in the target language and these words need to be worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the challenges and ineffectiveness of cultural influences in different notions where people do not see the facts of cultural enrichment. However, some of these ineffectiveness have been clearly mentioned in this research but some effective ways have also been dictated.</description>

      <title>Temporal dynamics of goal scoring in soccer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the temporal distribution of goals in soccer using event-level data from 3,433 matches across 21 leagues and competitions. Contrary to the prevailing notion of randomness, we found that the probability of a goal being scored is higher as matches progress, and we observed fewer-than-expected goals in the early minutes of each half. Further analysis of the time between subsequent goals shows an exponential decay, indicating that most goals naturally cluster closer together in time. By splitting this distribution by the team that scores the next goal, we observe bursty goal-scoring dynamics, wherein the same team is more likely to score again shortly after its previous goal. These findings highlight the importance of match context (whether driven by fatigue, tactical adaptations, or psychological momentum) in shaping when teams are able to score. Moreover, the results open avenues for extending data-driven methods for identifying high-impact moments in a match and refining strategic decision-making in soccer's evolving analytical landscape.</description>

      <title>Gender assignment in doctoral theses: revisiting Teseo with a method based on cultural consensus theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study critically evaluates gender assignment methods within academic contexts, employing a comparative analysis of diverse techniques, including a SVM classifier, gender-guesser, genderize.io, and a Cultural Consensus Theory based classifier. Emphasizing the significance of transparency, data sources, and methodological considerations, the research introduces nomquamgender, a cultural consensus-based method, and applies it to Teseo, a Spanish dissertation database. The results reveal a substantial reduction in the number of individuals with unknown gender compared to traditional methods relying on INE data. The nuanced differences in gender distribution underscore the importance of methodological choices in gender studies, urging for transparent, comprehensive, and freely accessible methods to enhance the accuracy and reliability of gender assignment in academic research. After reevaluating the problem of gender imbalances in the doctoral system we can conclude that it's still evident although the trend is clearly set for its reduction. Finaly, specific problems related to some disciplines, including STEM fields and seniority roles are found to be worth of attention in the near future.</description>

      <title>The Physics and Metaphysics of Social Powers: Bridging Cognitive Processing and Social Dynamics, a New Perspective on Power through Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of power can be explored at several scales: from physical action and process effectuation, all the way to complex social dynamics. A spectrum-wide analysis of power requires attention to the fundamental principles that constrain these processes. In the social realm, the acquisition and maintenance of power is intertwined with both social interactions and cognitive processing capacity: socially-facilitated empowerment grants agents more information-processing capacities and opportunities, either by relying on others to bring about desired policies or ultimately outcomes, and/or by enjoying more information-processing possibilities as a result of relying on others for the reproduction of (material) tasks. The effects of social empowerment thus imply an increased ability to harness computation toward desired ends, thereby augmenting the evolution of a specific state space. Empowered individuals attract the attention of others, who contribute to increasing the scale of their access to various policies effectuating these state spaces. The presented argument posits that social power, in the context of active inference, is a function of several variables. As a result of its power-amplifying effects, this extended computational ability also buffers against possible vulnerabilities. We propose that individuals wield power not only by associating with others possessing desirable policies, but also by enhancing their ability to intake and compute information effectively. This dual mechanism is argued to create a cyclical, reinforcing pattern wherein the empowered are able to incrementally expand the scope of policies and state spaces available to them while minimizing risk-exposure.</description>

      <title>Report on Reproducibility in Condensed Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present recommendations for how to improve reproducibility in the field of condensed matter physics. This area of physics has consistently produced both fundamental insights into the functioning of matter as well as transformative inventions. Our recommendations result from a collaboration that includes researchers in academia and government laboratories, scientific journalists, legal professionals, representatives of publishers, professional societies, and other experts. The group met in person in May 2024 at a conference at the University of Pittsburgh to discuss the growing challenges related to research reproducibility in condensed matter physics. We discuss best practices and policies at all stages of the scientific process to safeguard the value condensed matter research brings to society. We look forward to comments and suggestions, especially regarding subfield-specific recommendations, and will incorporate them into the next version of the report.</description>

      <title>Modelling Infodemics on a Global Scale: A 30 Countries Study using Epidemiological and Social Listening Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infodemics are a threat to public health, arising from multiple interacting phenomena occurring both online and offline. The continuous feedback loops between the digital information ecosystem and offline contingencies make infodemics particularly challenging to define operationally, measure, and eventually model in quantitative terms. In this study, we present evidence of the effect of various epidemic-related variables on the dynamics of infodemics, using a robust modelling framework applied to data from 30 countries across diverse income groups. We use WHO COVID-19 surveillance data on new cases and deaths, vaccination data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, infodemic data (volume of public conversations and social media content) from the WHO EARS platform, and Google Trends data to represent information demand. Our findings show that new deaths are the strongest predictor of the infodemic, measured as new document production including social media content and public conversations, and that the epidemic burden in neighbouring countries appears to have a greater impact on document production than the domestic one. Building on these results, we propose a taxonomy that highlights country-specific discrepancies between the evolution of the infodemic and the epidemic. Further, an analysis of the temporal evolution of the relationship between the two phenomena quantifies how much the discussions around vaccine rollouts may have shaped the development of the infodemic. The insights from our quantitative model contribute to advancing infodemic research, highlighting the importance of a holistic approach integrating both online and offline dimensions.</description>

      <title>Financial instability transition under heterogeneous investments and portfolio diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the stability of financial investment networks, where financial institutions hold overlapping portfolios of assets. We consider the effect of portfolio diversification and heterogeneous investments using a random matrix dynamical model driven by portfolio rebalancing. While heterogeneity generally correlates with heightened volatility, increasing diversification may have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect depending on the connectivity level of the network. The stability/instability transition is dictated by the largest eigenvalue of the random matrix governing the time evolution of the endogenous components of the returns, for which different approximation schemes are proposed and tested against numerical diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Managing CO2 under global and country-specific net-zero emissions targets in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Union (EU) is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This requires capturing CO2, eventually transporting it to different regions, to then either convert it into valuable products or sequester it underground. Although the target is set for the EU as a whole, in practice, most of the governance and strategy to attain it remains in the individual member states. Using the networked sector-coupled model PyPSA-Eur, we explored the impacts of imposing net-zero emissions globally for the entire EU versus imposing carbon neutrality for each country. As expected, under a global CO2 target, some countries are net CO2 emitters, while others are net CO2 absorbers. Forcing net-zero emissions in every country increases system cost by 1.4%, demands varied CO2 prices, and triggers higher investment in direct air capture and renewable capacities. In both scenarios, a significant portion of the captured CO2 is transported across Europe either directly in CO2 pipelines or indirectly via solid biomass or synthetic methane gas, methanol, and oil.</description>

      <title>The Atlas for the Aspiring Network Scientist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network science is the field dedicated to the investigation and analysis of complex systems via their representations as networks. We normally model such networks as graphs: sets of nodes connected by sets of edges and a number of node and edge attributes. This deceptively simple object is the starting point of never-ending complexity, due to its ability to represent almost every facet of reality: chemical interactions, protein pathways inside cells, neural connections inside the brain, scientific collaborations, financial relations, citations in art history, just to name a few examples. If we hope to make sense of complex networks, we need to master a large analytic toolbox: graph and probability theory, linear algebra, statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorics, and more.
  This book aims at providing the first access to all these tools. It is intended as an "Atlas", because its interest is not in making you a specialist in using any of these techniques. Rather, after reading this book, you will have a general understanding about the existence and the mechanics of all these approaches. You can use such an understanding as the starting point of your own career in the field of network science. This has been, so far, an interdisciplinary endeavor. The founding fathers of this field come from many different backgrounds: mathematics, sociology, computer science, physics, history, digital humanities, and more. This Atlas is charting your path to be something different from all of that: a pure network scientist.</description>
