      <title>Compact localized states and magnetic flux-driven topological phase transition in a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a novel two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding model defined on a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry that hosts multiple flat bands (FBs) and supports topological phase transitions driven by a magnetic flux. This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport. Our findings put forward the diamond-dodecagon lattice as a robust and tunable platform for studying the flat-band physics and magnetic flux-controlled topological phenomena, offering promising experimental feasibility in photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Information lattice approach to the metal-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation functions and correlation lengths are frequently used to describe phase transitions in quantum systems, but they require an explicit choice of observables. The recently introduced information lattice instead provides an observable-independent way to identify where and at which scale information is contained in quantum lattice models. Here, we use it to study the difference between the metallic and insulating regime of one-dimensional tight-binding chains. We find that the information per scale follows a power law in metals at low temperature and that Friedel-like oscillations are visible in the information lattice. At high temperature or in insulators at low temperature, the information per scale decays exponentially. Thus, the information lattice is a useful tool for analyzing the metal-insulator transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene/hBN Moir\'e Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has established a highly versatile platform for correlated topological matter. This review synthesizes the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these interaction-driven topological phases. Experimentally, the landscape has rapidly expanded from initial Chern insulators in trilayer systems to fully quantized QAH states in thicker systems. Theoretically, it is believed that moir\'e potential and electron-electron interaction cooperate and produce the QAH effect in such systems. Theoretical calculations also bring interesting questions, such as the formation of an interaction-driven topological phase known as an anomalous Hall crystal (AHC). This review comprehensively covers the experimental hallmarks, the theoretical frameworks, including continuum models and many-body approaches, and the ensuing physical picture that reconciles the roles of interactions, displacement fields, and the moir\'e potentials. We conclude by outlining outstanding open questions and future directions, positioning RMG/hBN systems at the forefront of topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing energy gap in quantum spin liquids via polarization amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped N\'eel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_\chi$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Variational study of the magnetization plateaus in the spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet: an approach from vision transformer neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the magnetization curve of the spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg model in a magnetic field. Using state-of-the-art variational wavefunctions based on neural networks, we confirm the presence of robust magnetization plateaus at $m=1/3$, $5/9$ and $7/9$ of the saturation value, stabilized by a spontaneous symmetry breaking of lattice translations with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell. Regarding the more challenging $m=1/9$ plateau, we find two competing valence bond crystals depending on the system size, both breaking translation as well as point group symmetries and with a larger $3\times 3$ unit cell. Such quantum states with local modulations of the magnetization average values could be observed experimentally in the near future.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Fermi surface and universality of the metal-metal and metal-insulator transitions: $d$-dimensional Hatsugai-Kohmoto model as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The earlier theory [1] of the quantum phase transitions related to the change of the Fermi Surface Topology (FST) is advanced. For such transitions the Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold determined by the Lee-Yang zeros, the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ as the $d$-volume of the Fermi sea, and the special FST universality class were introduced in [1]. The exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) $d$-dimensional ($d=1,2,3$) model of interacting fermions is analyzed. We explore the relation between the Lee-Yang zeros, the Luttinger and the plateau (Oshikawa) theorems. The validity of the Luttinger theorem in the HK model is confirmed. It is shown that the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ and the FST universality class describe the transitions between metal and band/Mott insulators, as well as the Lifshitz and van Hove gapless-to-gapless transitions. The gapless phases are established to be the Landau Fermi liquids (metals). In addition to the conventional paradigm with a continuous order parameter, we apply the homology theory to analyze the FST transitions. They are critical points of the Morse function. To quantify FST we use the Euler characteristic, which is calculated for each phase of the HK model. We claim that the FST universality class is robust with respect to interactions and other model details, under the condition that the critical points are non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical quasiparticle dynamics in antiferromagnets revealed by time- and momentum-resolved X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy flows among coupled subsystems are essential for ultrafast dynamics and high-speed technologies. In magnetic materials, spin fluctuations -- magnons -- mediate these flows in ultrafast magnetism. Yet momentum-resolved access to low-energy magnons governing the microscopic dynamics has been lacking. Using time-resolved resonant diffuse scattering alongside complementary time-resolved X-ray techniques and quantum-kinetic simulations, we unveil the hierarchical energy pathways among correlated systems in the photoexcited antiferromagnet CuO. Above-bandgap excitation triggers near-instantaneous spin disorder, generating non-thermal magnons throughout reciprocal space within femtoseconds. Real-time momentum-resolved tracking reveals picosecond magnon quasi-thermalization, followed by nanosecond recovery via momentum-selective magnon-phonon scattering. The quasiparticle dispersion mismatch creates recovery bottlenecks that control non-equilibrium lifetimes. This microscopic framework transcends phenomenological models and generalizes across materials, establishing design principles for ultrafast control of material properties.</description>

      <title>Resonant level model coupled to a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a resonant level model coupled to a strongly interacting electron bath modeled by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Different from the well-investigated case of a structureless non-interacting Fermi gas bath leading to a temperature-independent exponential decay of the impurity orbital occupation, we find a temperature-dependent oscillatory decay. We attribute this difference to the lack of quasiparticles in the SYK model, which is reflected in its singular density of states at the Fermi level. Our results are exact and can be obtained analytically by mapping to a suitably structured Fermi gas bath as an ancillary model for the SYK bath.</description>

      <title>Observing dissipationless flow of an impurity in a strongly repulsive quantum fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frictionless motion of an object through a fluid medium is commonly viewed as a hallmark of superfluidity. According to Landau, kinematic constraints prohibit superfluid behavior in one-dimensional (1D) bosonic systems. Here, using ultracold atoms, we show how a microscopic impurity can propagate through a strongly interacting 1D Bose gas without any friction, at odds with conventional expectations. We inject the impurity with initial velocities ranging from the subsonic to supersonic regime, and subsequently track its dynamics. For supersonic initial velocities, we observe the formation of a shock wave and a remarkably fast relaxation to a stationary regime, on a time scale that increases with decreasing impurity velocity. After reaching the stationary state, the impurity continues its motion through the system with a finite velocity. Our findings demonstrate how quantum effects can conspire to eliminate dissipation of a microscopic object immersed in a quantum fluid, thereby bringing novel insights into the propagation of matter and information in the quantum realm.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Gapped States and Symmetry-Enforced Gaplessness in 3-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing the infrared (IR) phases of a fermionic quantum theory in three spatial dimensions, based on its quantum anomalies associated with a finite symmetry. We uncover a fundamental dichotomy among these anomalies: the first class of anomalies can always be realized by symmetric gapped states, while the second class can never be realized by gapped states without breaking the given symmetry, establishing the phenomenon of symmetry-enforced gaplessness in these settings. Moreover, using the construction of symmetry extension, we construct the candidate gapped states that theories with the first class of anomalies can flow to in the IR. As an application, we provide concrete predictions of the candidate IR phases of (3+1)-dimensional gauge theories based on our results. Our results also suggest that systems with discrete chiral anomalies cannot be gapped out by adding arbitrary bosonic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Magic and Wormholes in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any quantum state is fully specified by the expectation values of a complete set of Hermitian operators. For a system of Majorana fermions, such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, this set of observables can be taken to be all possible strings of Majorana fermion operators. The expectation values of these fermion strings in a thermal state depend erratically on the microscopic couplings that specify the SYK Hamiltonian, and we study their statistical properties directly in the thermodynamic limit using path integral techniques. When the underlying SYK Hamiltonian is chaotic, we find that these expectation values are well-modeled as real Gaussian random variables with zero mean and a variance that we compute. In contrast, for the integrable variant of SYK, we find that the expectation values are actually non-Gaussian. We then use these results to study measures of magic in the SYK thermal state, including the robustness of magic and the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. We also show that our results can be quantitatively reproduced with a dual gravity calculation in the chaotic case at sufficiently low temperature. In this dual gravity model the variance of a given microscopic operator string is related to a wormhole geometry stabilized by a massive particle which is dual to the operator string. Our results thus provide a concrete and quantitative setting in which to study the relationship between randomness, wormholes, and closed universes as well as a holographic dual of quantum magic.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz critical points meet Zamolodchikov perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical points of classical and quantum lattice models are often described by scale-invariant Lifshitz theories which are anisotropic in the continuum limit, as characterized by a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq1$. This type of critical behavior can in principle be studied by deforming ordinary $z=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) by relevant vector operators breaking the rotational/Lorentz symmetry. In this short note, we consider a two-dimensional system of coupled minimal model CFTs $\mathcal{M}_{m,m+1}$ which realizes this perspective in a controlled fashion via Zamolodchikov's large $m$ expansion. The model turns out to exhibit interesting properties, including a manifold of interacting Lifshitz fixed points and emergent rotational symmetry in the infrared.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Spin-Splitting Induced by Spin-Orbit Coupling in Non-magnetic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to splitting of otherwise spin-degenerate bands in noncentrosymmetric materials, even if time-reversal symmetry is present. While this gives rise to well-known phenomena such as the Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, various other terms are allowed based on the point group of the crystal and the electronic Hamiltonian. In this study, we utilize point group representations to illustrate that four different types of SOC terms (Rashba, Dresselhaus, Weyl, and Ising) can emerge in periodic solids. We construct reciprocal space energy expressions for each type of SOC-induced splitting of opposite spin bands, and follow a similar procedure to also obtain minimal tight-binding models that capture all types of spin-splittings for subgroups of the cubic parent group $m\bar{3}m$. Furthermore, we also obtain a complete list of nodal features in the electronic band structure in these systems, distinguishing between crystallographic-symmetry-imposed nodal lines and those imposed by time-reversal-symmetry only. Finally, we conclude by presenting a list of materials that host each type of inversion-breaking SOC effects. Our classification of the spin-splitting symmetries in non-magnetic systems with SOC is the counterpart of the recent classification of spin-splitting symmetries in unconventional magnetic systems without SOC, such as altermagnets and odd-parity magnets. More broadly, our work provides a basis for studying superconductivity and other collective electronic phenomena that are impacted by SOC-induced band splittings in noncentrosymmetric materials.</description>

      <title>Three-body Fermi-liquid corrections for Andreev transport through quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study crossed Andreev reflection occurring in quantum dots connected to one superconducting lead and two normal leads at low temperatures $T$. Specifically, we derive an exact formula for the conductance up to order $T^2$ in the large superconducting gap limit, which is expressed in terms of the transmission probabilities of Cooper pairs and interacting Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our formulation is based on the latest version of Fermi-liquid theory for the Anderson impurity model, which has clarified the quasiparticle energy shifts of order $\omega^2$ and $T^2$ -- that is, corrections of the same order as those arising from the finite lifetime of quasiparticles -- can be exactly taken into account through three-body correlations of impurity electrons. We also demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve and affect the Cooper-pair tunneling as the Andreev level moves away from the Fermi level, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The results demonstrate that the Cooper-pair contribution to the $T^2$ term of the nonlocal conductance becomes comparable to the Bogoliubov-quasiparticle contribution in the parameter region where superconducting proximity effects dominate over the Kondo effect.</description>

Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory and determinant quantum Monte Carlo methods, we show that Janus graphene nanoribbons with topological defect arrays ($m=2$) exhibit robust intrinsic ferromagnetism across widths $W=2-6$, with bandgaps exceeding 200 $meV$ and stable ferromagnetic ground states. Notably, uniaxial tensile strain significantly enhances their ferromagnetic properties: at 25\% strain, the Curie temperature increases to $222K$, a fivefold improvement over unstrained systems and the highest reported for graphene-based nanoribbons. Strain also induces a reversible transition to a bipolar magnetic semiconductor, with spin-flipped valence and conduction band edges beyond 10\% strain. This dual functionality, strain-enhanced ferromagnetism and strain-induced spin flip, stems from strain-modulated $p_{z}$ orbital hybridization and strong direct exchange interaction. Among these, $W=5$ Janus graphene nanoribbons emerge as potential candidates for room-temperature spintronic devices and strain-programmable quantum transport systems.</description>

      <title>Boundary mutual information in double holography</title>

Abstract: We consider a composite system where AdS$_3$ gravity is coupled to a flat heat bath and investigate the mutual information between two subregions on the intersection of the AdS$_3$ and bath, referred to as the boundary mutual information (BMI). The corresponding entanglement entropy is captured via quantum extremal surfaces (QES), which holographically be computed by a surface optimization algorithm based on ``Surface Evolver''. We focus on both connected and disconnected configurations of the quantum entanglement wedge (Q-EW) in the AdS$_3$ bulk and analyze the finite corrections to the BMI. Our numerical results reveal a phase transition of the BMI as the separation between two subregions increases. Furthermore, we find that the BMI can naturally be decomposed into two distinct components: a geometric term arising from the areas of the quantum extremal surfaces, and a correction term resulting from bulk quantum fields within the Q-EW. Interestingly, the geometric contribution always exceeds the total BMI, indicating a negative correction from the bulk matter fields. This negativity can be understood as the result of subtracting a greater contribution from quantum fields in the connected Q-EW than in the disconnected one. We also reproduce the negative contribution of bulk quantum fields to BMI within a random tensor network (RTN) toy model of double holography. Modeling the bulk as a highly mixed state entangled with a large bath leads to a volume-law bulk entropy. In the large bond-dimension limit, the geometric part of the BMI remains non-negative, while the bulk entropy contribution becomes non-positive when the Q-EWs merge.</description>

      <title>Floquet implementation of a 3d fermionic toric code with full logical code space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet quantum error-correcting codes provide an operationally economical route to fault tolerance by dynamically generating stabilizer structures using only two-body Pauli measurements. But while it is well established that stabilizer codes in higher spatial dimensions gain additional levels of intrinsic robustness, higher-dimensional Floquet codes have hitherto been explored only in limited scope. Here we introduce a 3d generalization of a Floquet code whose instantaneous stabilizer group realizes a 3d fermionic toric code, while crucially preserving all three logical qubits throughout the entire measurement sequence. One central ingredient is the identification of a 3d lattice geometry that generalizes the features of the Kekul\'e lattice underlying the 2d Hastings-Haah code - specifically, a structure where deleting any one edge color yields a two-color subgraph that decomposes into short, closed loops rather than homologically nontrivial chains. This loop property avoids the collapse of logical information that plagues naive sequential two-color measurement schedules on many 3d lattices. Although, for our lattice geometry, a simple 3-round cycle that sequentially measures the three types of parity checks does not expose the full error syndrome set, we show that one can append a measurement sequence to extract the missing syndromes without disturbing the logical subspace. Beyond code design, 3d tricoordinated lattice geometries define a family of 3d monitored Kitaev models, in which random measurements of the non-commuting parity checks give rise to dynamically created entangled phases with nontrivial topology. In discussing the general structure of their underlying phase diagrams and, in particular, the existence of certain quantum critical points, we again make a connection to the general preservation of logical information in time-ordered Floquet protocols.</description>

      <title>Non-renormalization of the Hall viscosity of integer and Jain fractional quantum Hall phases by Coulomb interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We proof the non-renormalization of the Hall viscosity by Coulomb interactions for integer and fractional quantum Hall Jain states building on previous results obtained for the Hall conductivity. We employ Wigner-Weyl calculus in order to represent the Hall viscosity in terms of a topological invariant comprised of Green functions and work within the composite fermion field theory model of Jain states of the fractional quantum Hall fluid presented by Lopez and Fradkin. The topological expression is first derived within the free field theory of electrons and explicitly calculated for this case as well as in the mean field approximation of the composite fermion theory Jain states. The topological orbital spin of composite fermions distinguishes their mean field treatment from that of electrons resulting in an additional topological contribution. We then argue that the introduction of Coulomb interactions does not lead to perturbative corrections of the Hall viscosity in both integer and fractional quantum Hall fluids. The proof relies on the assumptions of homogeneity and rotational invariance of an underlying sample modulo the vector potential giving rise to the homogeneous external magnetic field. These conditions imply a Hall viscosity per emergent quasiparticle number density quantized in units of one half times the average quasiparticle orbital spin or one quarter times the Wen-Zee shift. The latter features a contribution from the composite fermion topological orbital spin relative to that of electrons.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum States Based on Selected Configurations</title>

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide a flexible and highly expressive parameterization of wave functions for strongly correlated problems in quantum chemistry. Despite rapid advances in network architectures, the evaluation of electronic energies remains almost exclusively based on variational Monte Carlo (VMC). While VMC is effective for structured systems such as spin chains, its accuracy and efficiency for electronic Hamiltonians are hindered by sharply peaked distributions, stochastic gradient noise, and slow convergence with sample size. In this letter, we assess the capability of NQS-VMC to efficiently capture correlation in electronic ground states by comparing it to a recently developed NQS-based selected configuration (NQS-SC) approach. We set up a systematic comparison of the ground-state optimizations obtained with NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems dominated by either static or dynamical correlation. The comparison demonstrates a clear advantage of NQS-SC over NQS-VMC in both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients, particularly for statically correlated molecules. Moreover, NQS-SC exhibits robust systematic improvability, whereas NQS-VMC does not. These findings position NQS-SC as the new default approach over NQS-VMC for electronic structure calculations. We further observe that neither NQS-SC nor NQS-VMC can efficiently capture dynamical correlation, highlighting the need for future hybrid methods, such as multiconfigurational perturbation theories built on top of NQS solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a method for computing accurate and scalable nuclear forces within the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework. Our approach leverages automatic differentiation of the energy functional to obtain nuclear gradients at a computational cost comparable to that of energy evaluation. The accuracy of the method is validated against finite difference calculations, showing excellent agreement. We then explore several machine learning (ML) strategies for learning noisy AFQMC data. These ML potentials are subsequently used to perform geometry optimizations and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, successfully identifying the transition state of the formamide-formimidic acid tautomerization. The resulting transition state geometry and barrier heights are in close agreement with coupled-cluster reference values. This work paves the way for highly accurate geometry optimization, molecular dynamics, or reaction path calculations.</description>

      <title>Matter-induced plaquette terms in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying confinement, topological order, and exotic quantum matter. In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.</description>

      <title>XDiag: Exact Diagonalization for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet its role in identifying topological phase transitions in disordered systems remains underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase, a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. By analyzing domain-wall configurations in the SSH chain, we further show how subsystem tuning allows one to distinguish genuine topological zero-energy eigenstates from trivial localized states. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter.</description>

Abstract: We analyze powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization data for the distorted honeycomb compound Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ using a first-order dimer expansion calculation and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that, in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an antiferromagnetic coupling that arises between the honeycomb layers, rather than the expected interchain coupling in the layers. This finding reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme for Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault model of the compound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate finite-temperature magnetic and topological phase transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets using an extended self-consistent renormalized spin-wave theory (SRSWT) that incorporates higher-order corrections from the Holstein--Primakoff expansion. Focusing on the combined effects of single-ion anisotropy, Zeeman field, next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) exchange, and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, we analyze how these parameters influence the magnetization curves and magnon spectra. This work serves two main goals. First, we critically examine the limitations of SRSWT, showing that in the absence of external or interaction tuning, the theory tends to overestimate magnon self-energy corrections, often predicting first-order magnetic transitions with multivalued magnetization and metastable solution branches (i.e., self-consistent but thermodynamically unstable states). Second, we demonstrate that topological transitions -- signaled by magnon gap closings at the Dirac points -- can be tuned to occur below the magnetic transition temperature and within the thermodynamically stable regime. In particular, we identify two practical tuning strategies: applying an external Zeeman field of appropriate sign depending on the anisotropy strength, and introducing a small antiferromagnetic NNN exchange coupling. These findings not only clarify the predictive scope and limitations of SRSWT but also provide experimentally relevant guidance for realizing thermally driven topological transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb magnetic insulators.</description>

Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to ultracold atom experiments on the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor. The ALM also leads to a wavefunction for the FL* state of the Hubbard model, which agrees with ultracold atom observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on SrTiO$_3$ are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $\Gamma$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $\Gamma$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Magnetism and Gate-Tunable Edelstein Response in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Odd-parity magnetism has attracted significant interest for its unconventional spin splitting. However, a concrete microscopic route for its realization remains elusive. In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we propose material candidates for the realization of our theory. Our results establish van der Waals heterostructures as a practical platform for non-relativistic spintronics with electric control of odd-parity spin textures.</description>

      <title>Elastoresistance as probe of strain-controlled entropy from Kondo scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy-fermion metals are prototype correlated electron systems for the study of Kondo entanglement and quantum criticality. We use the symmetry decomposed elastoresistance to uncover the fingerprints of strain-dependent Kondo scattering as function of temperature and magnetic field in the prototypical tetragonal Kondo lattice YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K.</description>

      <title>Universal Crossover in the Three-Channel Charge Kondo Model at High Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum impurity models provide a central framework for correlated electron physics, with quantum dots enabling controlled experimental realizations. While their weak-coupling behavior is well understood through mappings to Kondo Hamiltonians, the opposite regime of highly transparent contacts has lacked a controlled theoretical description. Using the functional renormalization group (FRG), we resolve this regime for the three-channel charge Kondo device of Ref.~\cite{iftikhar2018}, benchmarking against conformal field theory by reproducing the universal zero-frequency conductance and, crucially, going beyond it to obtain the full frequency crossover of the conductance and the full temperature crossover of the impurity entropy, together with a continuous line of fixed points for interacting leads. These results establish FRG as a powerful nonperturbative tool for quantum impurity problems in regimes inaccessible to conventional approaches, with direct implications for mesoscopic experiments.</description>

      <title>Bilayer graphene quantum dots as a quantum simulator of Haldane topological quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate here that a chain of Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots (BLGQDs) can realize topological quantum matter by effectively simulating a spin-1 chain that hosts the Haldane phase within a specific range of parameters. We describe a chain of BLGQDs with two electrons per dot using an atomistic tight-binding model combined with exact diagonalization to solve the interacting few-electron problem. Coulomb interactions and valley-mixing effects are treated within a single microscopic framework, allowing us to systematically investigate spin and valley polarization transitions as functions of interaction strength and external tuning parameters. We calculate the low energy states for single and double QDs as a function of the number of electrons, identifying regimes of highly correlated multi-electron states. We confirm the presence of a spin-one ground state for two electrons. Then, we explore two coupled QDs with 4 electrons and extend the analysis to QD arrays. Using a mapping of the BLGQD chain to an effective bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ) spin model, we demonstrate that BLGQD arrays can work as a quantum simulator for one-dimensional spin chains with emergent many-body topological phases.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion II. Assessing the recombination scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], we revisited the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion in the $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM), emphasizing the existence of a protected operator which is a closed form with $N-1$ indices. The scaling dimension of this operator stays exactly equal to $N-1$, independently of $\epsilon$. Its existence is problematic for the identification of the NLSM fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ with the Wilson-Fisher fixed point family obtained by analytically continuing from near $d=4$, which does not possess such a protected operator. Multiplet recombination is one scenario discussed in [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], which could allow to connect the two families continuously (although not analytically). In this scenario, the protected dimension is lifted at some critical value of $\epsilon$, thanks to the short conformal multiplet of scaling dimension $N-1$ eating a long conformal multiplet of higher scaling dimension. In this followup work, we assess this scenario for the cases $N=3$ and $N=4$. We identify the lowest candidates for the long multiplet which could be eaten, and compute their one-loop anomalous dimensions. We find that at one loop, scaling dimensions of these candidates grow with $\epsilon$, while it should decrease down to $N$ for the recombination to occur. We conclude that multiplet recombination is unlikely.</description>
