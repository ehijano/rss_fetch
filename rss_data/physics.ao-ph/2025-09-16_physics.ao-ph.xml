      <title>SamudrACE: Fast and Accurate Coupled Climate Modeling with 3D Ocean and Atmosphere Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional numerical global climate models simulate the full Earth system by exchanging boundary conditions between separate simulators of the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, land surface, and other geophysical processes. This paradigm allows for distributed development of individual components within a common framework, unified by a coupler that handles translation between realms via spatial or temporal alignment and flux exchange. Following a similar approach adapted for machine learning-based emulators, we present SamudrACE: a coupled global climate model emulator which produces centuries-long simulations at 1-degree horizontal, 6-hourly atmospheric, and 5-daily oceanic resolution, with 145 2D fields spanning 8 atmospheric and 19 oceanic vertical levels, plus sea ice, surface, and top-of-atmosphere variables. SamudrACE is highly stable and has low climate biases comparable to those of its components with prescribed boundary forcing, with realistic variability in coupled climate phenomena such as ENSO that is not possible to simulate in uncoupled mode.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hydrodynamic Modeling of Offshore Wind Turbines using Morison's Equation with Frequency-Dependent Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for implementing frequency-dependent hydrodynamic coefficients in Morison's equation, which is widely used in hydrodynamics modeling. Accurate hydrodynamic predictions using Morison's equation necessitate the incorporation of frequency-dependent drag coefficients due to their variation with wave frequency. To address this, the proposed method segments the frequency domain into different regions, such as low-frequency (resonance) and high-frequency (wave) regions. Instead of using a constant drag coefficient across the entire spectrum, different drag coefficients are assigned to these regions. To implement this, a fifth-order low-pass Butterworth velocity filter is applied for the resonance zone, while a first-order high-pass Butterworth velocity filter is applied for the wave-dominated zone. The approach is validated using the INO WINDMOOR 12MW semisubmersible offshore wind turbine, comparing the simulation results against the experimental data. By incorporating frequency-dependent drag coefficients, the model shows improved agreement with experimental surge motion data across both frequency regions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Constraining Atmospheric River Uncertainty Using Instantaneous Poleward Latent Heat Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are extreme weather events that play a crucial role in the global hydrological cycle. As a key mechanism of latent heat transport (LHT), they help maintain energy balance in the climate system. While an AR is characterized by a long, narrow corridor of water vapor associated with a low-level jet stream, there is no unambiguous definition of an AR grounded in geophysical fluid dynamics. Therefore, AR identification is currently performed by a large array of expert-defined, threshold-based algorithms. The variety of algorithms introduces uncertainty in the estimated contribution of ARs to LHT. We calculate the instantaneous eddy LHT from moist, poleward anomalies. Based on the dynamics of the large-scale atmospheric circulation, this quantity is a physics-based upper bound that constrains AR projections from the variety of detection algorithms. We quantify the contribution of ARs to transient eddies, stationary eddies, and transient-stationary eddy interactions, and we show the relative contribution of ARs and other processes, such as dry, equatorward transport. We use this upper bound to quantify ARs' frequency, intensity, and temporal variability. In the historical climate, we find that ARs transport 2.21 PW at the latitude of peak meridional transport in Northern Hemisphere winter, with approximately 0.47 PW of temporal variability. By the end of the century in a future climate projection, at this latitude, we find that AR-induced LHT will increase by 0.5 PW and the corresponding temporal variability will increase by 0.14 PW.</description>

      <title>Extreme vertical drafts as drivers of Lagrangian dispersion in stably stratified turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion of Lagrangian particle pairs is a fundamental process in turbulence, with implications for mixing, transport, and the statistical properties of particles in geophysical and environmental flows. While classical theories describe pair dispersion through scaling laws related to energy cascades, extreme events in turbulent flows can significantly alter these dynamics. This is especially important in stratified flows, where intermittency manifests itself also as strong updrafts and downdrafts. In this study, we investigate the influence of extreme events on the relative dispersion of particle pairs in stably stratified turbulence. Using numerical simulations we analyze the statistical properties of pair separation across different regimes, and quantify deviations from classical Richardson scaling. Our results highlight the role of extreme drafts in accelerating dispersion. These findings have important implications for turbulent mixing in natural systems, including atmospheric and oceanic flows, as well as applications in cloud microphysics and pollutant transport.</description>

      <title>The Key Physics of Ice Premelting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.</description>

      <title>Investigating the use of terrain-following coordinates in AI-driven precipitation forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather prediction (AIWP) models often produce ``blurry'' precipitation forecasts. This study presents a novel solution to tackle this problem -- integrating terrain-following coordinates into AIWP models. Forecast experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of terrain-following coordinates using FuXi, an example AIWP model, adapted to 1.0 degree grid spacing data. Verification results show a largely improved estimation of extreme events and precipitation intensity spectra. Terrain-following coordinates are also found to collaborate well with global mass and energy conservation constraints, with a clear reduction of drizzle bias. Case studies reveal that terrain-following coordinates can represent near-surface winds better, which helps AIWP models in learning the relationships between precipitation and other prognostic variables. The result of this study suggests that terrain-following coordinates are worth considering for AIWP models in producing more accurate precipitation forecasts.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of overshooting tops and their properties from visible satellite channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overshooting tops (OTs) are informative indicators of convective storm intensity and are widely utilized in meteorological analyses. This study presents an automated algorithm for OT detection and OT height estimation using convolutional neural networks applied to visible satellite imagery. The models are trained and validated on an extensive OT dataset comprising approximately 10,000 manually detected cases over Europe. The OTs were identified from high-resolution visible (HRV) channel of the SEVIRI instrument on board the MSG geostationary satellite, with the heights determined from the length of their shadows in the imagery. While conventional OT detection methods primarily rely on the identification of cold features in thermal infrared channels, our approach extracts information from visible channels, leveraging the ground truth data on OT shadow length provided by the training dataset. In the morning and afternoon hours, when the shadows are visible, the proposed models detect OTs with a probability of detection reaching 97% and estimate their height with an average error of 0.25 km. The performance is expected to further improve once the model is applied to polar and new generation geostationary satellites with increased spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Causal Feedback Discovery using Convergence Cross Mapping on Sea Ice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying causal relationships in climate systems remains challenging due to nonlinear, coupled dynamics that limit the effectiveness of linear and stochastic causal discovery approaches. This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.</description>
