      <title>Dynamical friction from self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Merging compact objects such as binary black holes provide a promising probe for the physics of dark matter (DM). The gravitational waves emitted during inspiral potentially allow to detect DM spikes around black holes. This is because the dynamical friction force experienced by the inspiraling black hole alters the orbital period and thus the gravitational wave signal. Aims. The dynamical friction arising from DM can potentially differ from the collisionless case when DM is subject to self-interactions. This paper aims to understand how self-interactions impact dynamical friction. Methods. To study the dynamical friction force, we use idealized N-body simulations, where we include self-interacting dark matter. Results. We find that the dynamical friction force for inspiraling black holes would be typically enhanced by DM self-interactions compared to a collisionless medium (ignoring differences in the DM density). At lower velocities below the sound speed, we find that the dynamical friction force can be reduced by the presence of self-interactions. Conclusions. DM self-interactions have a significant effect on the dynamical friction for black hole mergers. Assuming the Chandrasekhar formula may underpredict the deceleration due to dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter distinguished by skewed microlensing in the "Dragon Arc"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensed stars recently discovered by JWST &amp; HST follow closely the winding critical curve of A370 along all sections of the ``Dragon Arc" traversed by the critical curve. These transients are fainter than $m_{AB}&gt;26.5$, corresponding to the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and microlensed by diffuse cluster stars observed with $\simeq 18M_\odot/pc^2$, or about $\simeq 1$\% of the projected dark matter density. Most microlensed stars appear along the inner edge of the critical curve, following an asymmetric band of width $\simeq 4$kpc that is skewed by $-0.7\pm0.2$kpc. Some skewness is expected as the most magnified images should form along the inner edge of the critical curve with negative parity, but the predicted shift is small $\simeq -0.04$kpc and the band of predicted detections is narrow, $\simeq 1.4$kpc. Adding CDM-like dark halos of $10^{6-8}M_\odot$ broadens the band as desired but favours detections along the outer edge of the critical curve, in the wrong direction, where sub-halos generate local Einstein rings. Instead, the interference inherent to ``Wave Dark Matter" as a Bose-Einstein condensate ($\psi$DM) forms a symmetric band of critical curves that favours negative parity detections. A de Broglie wavelength of $\simeq 10$pc matches well the observed $4$kpc band of microlenses and predicts negative skewness $\simeq -0.6$kpc, similar to the data. The implied corresponding boson mass is $\simeq 10^{-22}$eV, in good agreement with estimates from dwarf galaxy cores when scaled by momentum. Further JWST imaging may reveal the pattern of critical curves by simply ``joining the dots" between microlensed stars, allowing wave corrugations of $\psi$DM to be distinguished from CDM sub-halos</description>

      <title>Constraining Inflation with the BICEP/Keck CMB Polarization Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BICEP/$\textit{Keck}$ (BK) series of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments has, over the past decade and a half, produced a series of field-leading constraints on cosmic inflation via measurements of the "B-mode" polarization of the CMB. Primordial B modes are directly tied to the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves (PGW), their strength parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and thus the energy scale of inflation. Having set the most sensitive constraints to-date on $r$, $\sigma(r)=0.009$ ($r_{0.05}&lt;0.036, 95\%$ C.L.) using data through the 2018 observing season (``BK18''), the BICEP/$\textit{Keck}$ program has continued to improve its dataset in the years since. We give a brief overview of the BK program and the "BK18" result before discussing the program's ongoing efforts, including the deployment and performance of the $\textit{Keck Array}$'s successor instrument, BICEP Array, improvements to data processing and internal consistency testing, new techniques such as delensing, and how those will ultimately serve to allow BK reach $\sigma(r) \lesssim 0.003$ using data through the 2027 observing season.</description>

      <title>Constraining small-scale primordial magnetic fields from the abundance of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of magnetic fields in the early universe affects the cosmological processes, leading to the distinct signature, which allows constraining their properties and the genesis mechanisms. In this study, we revisit the method to constrain the amplitude of the magnetic fields on small scales in the radiation-dominated era from the abundance of primordial black holes. Constraints in the previous work were based on the fact that the density perturbations sourced by stronger magnetic fields become large enough to gravitationally collapse to form PBHs. However, we demonstrate that this picture is incomplete because magnetic fields also increase the threshold value of the density contrast required for PBH formation. The increase in threshold density contrast is more pronounced on smaller scales, and in extreme cases, it might even prevent PBH production despite the presence of significant magnetic field. Taking into account the relevant physical effects on the magnetized overdense region, we establish an upper-limit on the amplitude of comoving magnetic fields, approximately $0.12-0.14 {\rm \mu G}$ at a scale of $10^{17} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additionally, we compare our constraints with various small-scale probes.</description>

      <title>Formation of the first halos, galaxies and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic objects with magnetic fields (quasars, radiogalaxies) are observed at redshifts $z\geq 7$ (Wang et al., 2021, Fan et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2024) and more (for instance, for $z = 10.073\pm 0.002$, Goulding et al., 2023) indicates the early creation of magnetic fields. The observations of the cosmic telescope JWST show that the first galaxies were formed at redshifts $z\simeq$ 15 -- 20. We link the transformation of the low mass dark matter halos into galaxies with the creation of the first stars owing to the radiative cooling of partly ionized hydrogen at $z\geq 10$. The early formation of galaxies creates favourable conditions for high impact of the Compton scattering of the relic radiation photons and electrons on the electron temperature and leads to the partial separation of electrons and protons. Together with turbulent motions such separation stimulates creation of magnetic fields on a galactic scale. The same processes distort the primordial perturbations of the relic radiation what can be observed and confirmed in special simulations.</description>

      <title>Do high redshift QSOs and GRBs corroborate JWST?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting unexpectedly massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the $\Lambda$CDM perspective. Interpreted as a problem of cosmological origin, this necessitates Planck underestimating either matter density $\Omega_m$ or physical matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$, with $\Omega_m$ remaining anomalously large at higher redshifts. While the variation of $\Omega_m$ with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ is at odds with the $\Lambda$CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in $\chi^2$ in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to $3.9 \sigma$ and $7.9 \sigma$ tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions.</description>

      <title>Haloes, other dark matter candidates and astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is possible that a multi-component dark matter model is required if primordial black holes only contribute to a fraction of the energy density in dark matter. This is increasingly more likely with respect to the case of $f_{\rm PBH} = 1$, since there is only one remaining window, on asteroid-mass scales, where primordial black holes can make up all of the dark matter. A mixed dark matter model can lead to interesting observables that come about due to the interactions between primordial black holes and the second dark matter component. This can provide unique signatures of the presence of primordial black holes and increase the prospects of detection or improvement of constraints in the mass ranges where $f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 1$, whilst simultaneously exploring the remaining open parameter space for other dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Role of Spatial Curvature in a Dark Energy Interacting Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of spatial curvature in a model where dark matter and dark energy interact. The analysis employs a range of datasets, including CMB, BAO, Type Ia Supernova, $H(z)$ from cosmic chronometers, $H_0$ measurements from Megamasers and SH0ES, growth rate data and strong lensing time delay measurements, to assess the model's fit and explore the late-time dynamics of the interacting dark sector in a non-flat cosmological framework. The study indicates that introducing curvature can significantly impact the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the structure growth parameter ($S_8$), potentially easing tensions between early and late universe observations. The observational data shows an indication for a closed universe. This implies that the presence of curvature and its influence cannot be neglected entirely.</description>

      <title>The energy shear of protohaloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As it collapses to form a halo, the shape of a protohalo patch is deformed by the initial shear field. This deformation is often modeled using the "deformation" tensor, constructed from second derivatives of the gravitational potential, whose trace gives the initial overdensity. However, especially for lower mass protohalos, this matrix is not always positive definite: one of its eigenvalues has a different sign from the others. We show that the evolution of a patch is better described by the "energy shear" tensor, which is positive definite and plays a direct role in the evolution. This positive-definiteness simplifies models of halo abundances, assembly and of the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>Proper time path integrals for gravitational waves: an improved wave optics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When gravitational waves travel from their source to an observer, they interact with matter structures along their path, causing distinct deformations in their waveforms. In this study we introduce a novel theoretical framework for wave optics effects in gravitational lensing, addressing the limitations of existing approaches. We achieve this by incorporating the proper time technique, typically used in field theory studies, into gravitational lensing. This approach allows us to extend the standard formalism beyond the eikonal and paraxial approximations, which are traditionally assumed, and to account for polarization effects, which are typically neglected in the literature. We demonstrate that our method provides a robust generalization of conventional approaches, including them as special cases. Our findings enhance our understanding of gravitational wave propagation, which is crucial for accurately interpreting gravitational wave observations and extracting unbiased information about the lenses from the gravitational wave waveforms.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing in More Realistic Dark Matter Halo Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate gravitational lensing within the framework of more realistic dark matter halo models, transcending the limitations of spherical-collapse approximations. Through analytical computations utilizing diverse mass functions, we address critical factors typically overlooked in the standard Press-Schechter formalism, including ellipsoidal-collapse conditions, angular momentum dynamics, dynamical friction, and the cosmological constant. Our analysis incorporates two widely recognized halo density profiles, the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, considering both spherical and ellipsoidal-collapse scenarios. We present relevant calculations of pivotal gravitational lensing observables, such as Einstein radii, lensing optical depths, and time delays, spanning a wide range of redshifts and masses across two distinct lensing models: the point mass and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) lens models. Our findings illuminate that adopting more realistic dark matter halo models leads to heightened lensing effects compared to their spherical-collapse counterparts. Furthermore, our analyses of lensing optical depths and time delays reveal distinct characteristics between point mass and SIS lens models. These outcomes highlight the need for more realistic halo descriptions instead of simple approximations when modeling gravitational lensing, as this approach can potentially better reveal the complex structures of dark matter.</description>

      <title>A consistency test of the cosmological model at the epoch of recombination using DESI BAO and Planck measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The value of the Hubble constant determined from CMB and BAO measurements is directly dependent on the sound horizon at the photon-baryon decoupling. There has been significant interest in the possibility of new physics at the epoch around recombination that could reduce the sound horizon and increase the inferred value of $H_0$, thus helping to relieve the Hubble tension. One way to determine if new physics is required would be to measure $H_0$ from BAO and CMB without assuming any model for computing the sound horizon. In this study, we use the recently released DESI Year 1 BAO data combined with the CMB acoustic scale $\theta_\star$ and the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prior on $\Omega_{\rm m} h^2$ to determine $H_0$ while treating the sound horizon at baryon decoupling $r_{\rm d}$ as a free parameter. We find $H_0=69.88 \pm 0.93$ km/s/Mpc, which is $\sim2\sigma$ larger than $H_0 = 67.44 \pm 0.47$ km/s/Mpc in the Planck-best-fit $\Lambda$CDM where $r_{\rm d}$ is derived using the standard recombination model. For comparison, we perform the same analysis using the pre-DESI BAO data with $\theta_\star$ and the same prior on $\Omega_{\rm m} h^2$, finding $H_0= 67.37 \pm 0.96$ km/s/Mpc. This difference derives from the notably larger value of the product $r_{\rm d}H_0$ measured by DESI. Future BAO data from DESI will help determine if the cosmological model at the epoch of recombination model requires a modification.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Completely Dark Photons with Nonminimal Couplings to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons are a theorized massive spin-1 particle which can be produced via various mechanisms, including cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) in the early universe. In this work, we extend previous results for GPP of dark photons to include nonminimal couplings to gravity. We find that nonminimal couplings can induce a ghost instability or lead to runaway particle production at high momentum and discuss the constraints on the parameter space such that the theory is free of instabilities. Within the instability-free regime we numerically calculate the particle production and find that the inclusion of nonminimal couplings can lead to an enhancement of the particle number. As a result, GPP of nonminimally coupled dark photons can open the parameter space for production of a cosmological relevant relic density (constituting all or part of the dark matter) as compared to the minimally-coupled theory. These results are independent of the choice of inflation model, which we demonstrate by repeating the analysis for a class of rapid-turn multi-field inflation models.</description>

Abstract: The hierarchical model of galaxy formation predicts that the Milky Way halo is populated by tidal debris of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. Due to long dynamical times, debris from the lowest mass objects remains coherent as thin and dynamically cold stellar streams for billions of years. The Gaia mission, providing astrometry and spectrophotometry for billions of stars, has brought three fundamental changes to our view of stellar streams in the Milky Way. First, more than a hundred stellar streams have been discovered and characterized using Gaia data. This is an order of magnitude increase in the number of known streams, thanks to Gaia's capacity for identifying comoving groups of stars among the field Milky Way population. Second, Gaia data have revealed that density variations both along and across stellar streams are common. Dark-matter subhalos, as well as baryonic structures were theoretically predicted to form such features, but observational evidence for density variations was uncertain before Gaia. Third, stream kinematics are now widely available and have constrained the streams' orbits and origins. Gaia has not only provided proper motions directly, but also enabled efficient spectroscopic follow-up of the proper-motion selected targets. These discoveries have established stellar streams as a dense web of sensitive gravitational tracers in the Milky Way halo. We expect the coming decade to bring a full mapping of the Galactic population of stellar streams, as well as develop numerical models that accurately capture their evolution within the Milky Way for a variety of cosmological models. Perhaps most excitingly, the comparison between the two will be able to reveal the presence of dark-matter subhalos below the threshold for galaxy formation (~10^6 Msun), and provide the most stringent test of the cold dark matter paradigm on small scales.</description>

      <title>NLO friction in symmetry restoring phase transitions</title>

Abstract: Interactions between bubbles/domain walls and the surrounding medium are a topic of active research, particularly as they apply to friction effects on accelerated expansion during first-order phase transitions. In this paper, we analyze for the first time friction pressure on relativistic walls in phase transitions where gauge symmetry is restored, particularly motivated by the observation that this pressure can, in principle, be negative at leading order, since some particles lose mass by definition as they cross into the new phase. We find, however, that at NLO, the soft emission of vectors from a charged current leads to positive pressure scaling as the wall's Lorentz boost factor $\gamma_w$, similar to the case of gauge symmetry breaking. Contrary to the latter case, we find that the dominant contribution in single emission is safe from IR divergences and exhibits a much stronger dependence on the wall shape. Finally, we argue that in any phase transition, no multi-particle process on the wall can impart negative pressure greater than the leading order result, in the asymptotic limit of large velocity.</description>

      <title>Development of the Low Frequency Telescope focal plane detector arrays for LiteBIRD</title>

Abstract: LiteBIRD, a forthcoming JAXA mission, aims to accurately study the microwave sky within the 40-400 GHz frequency range divided into 15 distinct nominal bands. The primary objective is to constrain the CMB inflationary signal, specifically the primordial B-modes. LiteBIRD targets the CMB B-mode signal on large angular scales, where the primordial inflationary signal is expected to dominate, with the goal of reaching a tensor-to-scalar ratio sensitivity of $\sigma_r\sim0.001$. LiteBIRD frequency bands will be split among three telescopes, with some overlap between telescopes for better control of systematic effects. Here we report on the development status of the detector arrays for the Low Frequency Telescope (LFT), which spans the 34-161 GHz range, with 12 bands subdivided between four types of trichroic pixels consisting of lenslet-coupled sinuous antennas. The signal from the antenna is bandpass filtered and sensed by AlMn Transition-Edge Sensors (TES). We provide an update on the status of the design and development of LiteBIRD's LFT LF1 (40-60-78 GHz), LF2 (50-68-89 GHz) pixels. We discuss design choices motivated by LiteBIRD scientific goals. In particular we focus on the details of the optimization of the design parameters of the sinuous antenna, on-chip bandpass filters, cross-under and impedance transformers and all the RF components that define the LF1 and LF2 pixel detection chain. We present this work in the context of the technical challenges and physical constraints imposed by the finite size of the instrument.</description>

      <title>A Sixteen Multiple-Amplifier-Sensing CCD and Characterization Techniques Targeting The Next Generation of Astronomical Instruments</title>

Abstract: This work presents a candidate sensor for future spectroscopic applications, such as a Stage-5 Spectroscopic Survey Experiment or the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This new type of CCD sensor features multiple in-line amplifiers at its output stage allowing multiple measurements of the same charge packet, either in each amplifier and/or in the different amplifiers. Recently, the operation of an 8-amplifier sensor has been experimentally demonstrated, and the operation of a 16-amplifier sensor is presented in this work. This new sensor enables a noise level of approximately $1^e_{\rm rms}$ with a single sample per amplifier. Additionally, it is shown that sub-electron noise can be achieved using multiple samples per amplifier. In addition to demonstrating the performance of the 16-amplifier sensor, this work aims to create a framework for future analysis and performance optimization of this type of detectors. New models and techniques are presented to characterize specific parameters, which are absent in conventional CCDs and Skipper-CCDs: charge transfer between amplifiers and independent and common noise in the amplifiers, and their processing.</description>

      <title>The key science drivers for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>

Abstract: Sub-mm and mm wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities: Where are all the baryons? How do structures interact with their environments? What does the time-varying (sub-)mm sky look like? In order to make major advances on these questions and others, what is needed now is a facility capable of rapidly mapping the sky spatially, spectrally, and temporally, which can only be done by a high throughput, single-dish observatory. An extensive design study for this new facility is currently being undertaken. In this paper, we focus on the key science drivers and the requirements they place on the observatory. As a 50m single dish telescope with a 1-2{\deg} field of view, the strength of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) is in science where a large field of view, highly multiplexed instrumentation and sensitivity to faint large-scale structure is important. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned telescopes.</description>

      <title>Can interacting dark energy with dynamical coupling resolve the Hubble tension</title>

Abstract: The $H_0$ tension between low- and high- redshift measurements is definitely a serious issue faced by current cosmologists since it ranges from 4$\sigma$ to 6$\sigma$. To relieve this tension, in this paper we propose a new interacting dark energy model with time varying coupling parameter by parameterizing the densities of dark matter and dark energy, this parametric approach for interacting dark sectors are inspired by our previous work concerning the coupled generalized three-form dark energy model in which dark matter and dark energy behave like two uncoupled dark sectors with effective equation of state when the three-form $|\kappa X|\gg1$, for this reason, we reconstruct coupled generalized three-form dark energy from such parametric model under the condition $|\kappa X_0|\gg1$. In the end, we place constraints on three parametric models in light of the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance priors, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data and the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data by assuming the parameter $k$ as 0,5,10 respectively. The fitting results show that, for all the observational data sets, the parametric models with $k=0,5,10$ relieve the Hubble tension with the latest local determinations of the Hubble constant from ${\rm SH_0ES}$ team, i.e. the so called R22, to 2.3 $\sigma$, 1.9 $\sigma$ and 1.3 $\sigma$ with $\chi_{\rm min}^2=10.43,10.47,10.48$ respectively, revealing that $k$ is positive correlated to the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on noncold dark matter and phenomenological emergent dark energy</title>

Abstract: It is well known that there are several long-standing problems implying the discordance of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Although most of the models proposed to resolve these problems assume that dark matter is pressureless, it is still possible that dark matter is not cold, as current observations have not ruled out this possibility yet. Therefore, in this article, we treat the dark matter equation of state parameter as a free parameter, and apply observational data to investigate the non-coldness of dark matter. Impressing by the simplicity of the phenomenological emergent dark energy (PEDE) and its ability to relieve the Hubble tension, we propose the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model based on PEDE and non-cold dark matter. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae. The results indicate a preference for a negative dark matter equation of state parameter at $95\%$ CL for all data sets except CMB alone and CMB+BAO, which suggests that the non-coldness assumption of dark matter worth to be investigated further in order to understand the nature of dark matter. The Hubble tension is alleviated in this scenario compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a significance below 3$\sigma$ level for all data sets except CMB+Pantheon. However, from the analysis based on Bayesian evidence, we clearly see that the data sets favor $\Lambda$CDM over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model.</description>

      <title>A Constrained NILC method for CMB B mode observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Internal Linear Combination (ILC) method is commonly employed to extract the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal from multi-frequency observation maps. However, the performance of the ILC method tends to degrade when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is relatively low, particularly when measuring the primordial $B$-modes to detect the primordial gravitational waves. To address this issue, an enhanced version of the ILC method, known as constrained ILC, is proposed. This method is designed to be more suitable for situations with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by incorporating additional prior foreground information. In our study, we have modified the constraint Needlet ILC method and successfully improved its performance at low SNR. We illustrate our methods using mock data generated from the combination of WMAP, Planck and a ground-based experiment in the northern hemisphere, and the chosen noise level for the ground-based experiment are very conservative which can be easily achieved in the very near future. The results show that the level of foreground residual can be well controlled. In comparison to the standard NILC method, which introduces a bias to the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) of approximately $0.05$, the constrained NILC method exhibits a significantly reduced bias of only around $5\times10^{-3}$ towards $r$ which is much smaller than the statistical error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the formalism to calculate non-Gaussianity of primordial curvature perturbations produced by preheating in the presence of a light scalar field. The calculation is carried out in the separate universe approximation using the non-perturbative delta N formalism and lattice field theory simulations. Initial conditions for simulations are drawn from a statistical ensemble determined by modes that left the horizon during inflation, with the time-dependence of Hubble rate during inflation taken into account. Our results show that cosmic variance, i.e., the contribution from modes with wavelength longer than the size of the observable universe today, plays a key role in determining the dominant contribution. We illustrate our formalism by applying it to an observationally-viable preheating model motivated by non-minimal coupling to gravity, and study its full parameter dependence.</description>

      <title>PNG-UNITsims: Halo clustering response to primordial non-Gaussianities as a function of mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the largest full N-body simulation to date with local primordial non-Gaussianities (L-PNG), the \textsc{PNG-UNITsim}. It tracks the evolution of $4096^3$ particles within a periodic box with $L_{\rm box} = 1 \; h^{-1}\,{\rm Gpc}$, leading to a mass resolution of $m_{p} = 1.24\times 10^{9}\; h^{-1}\,M_\odot$. This is enough to resolve galaxies targeted by stage-IV spectroscopic surveys. The \textsc{PNG-UNIT} has \textit{Fixed} initial conditions whose phases are also \textit{Matched} to the pre-existing \textsc{UNIT} simulation. These two features in the simulations reduce our uncertainty significantly so we use 100 \textsc{FastPM} mocks to estimate this reduction. The amplitude of the non-Gaussianities used to set the initial conditions of this new simulation is $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local} = 100$. In this first study, we use mass selected dark matter haloes from the \textsc{PNG-UNIT} simulation to constrain the local PNG parameters. PNG induce a scale dependent bias, parameterised through \bp or $p$, which might depend on the type of cosmological tracer. Those cases when $p=1$ are referred to as the {\it universality relation}. We measure $p$ as a function of the halo mass. Haloes with masses between $1\times 10^{12}$ and $2\times 10^{13} \, h^{-1} M_\odot$ are well described by the {\it universality relation}. For haloes with masses between $2\times 10^{10}$ and $1\times 10^{12} \, h^{-1} M_\odot$ we find that $p&lt;1$ at $3\sigma$. Combining all the mass bins, we find $p$ consistent with a value of $0.955\pm0.013$, which is $3\sigma$ away from \textit{universality}, as low mass haloes are more numerous. We also study the effect of using priors on $p$ when constraining $f_{\rm NL}$. Using the values we obtain for $b_\phi$ as priors, we forecast that a DESI-like (stage-IV) survey will be able to constrain $f_{\rm NL}$ better than if the universality relation is assumed.</description>

Abstract: We present the electromagnetic (EM) dipole radiation flux from an eccentric Keplerian binary endowed with scalar charges, in the presence of scalar-photon coupling $\phi A_\mu A^\mu$ or $\phi F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. The scalar radiation is suppressed for orbital frequency below the scalar mass, while the scalar-mediated indirect EM radiation survives. We examine the constraints imposed on the scalar-photon and scalar-charge coupling by the current observational data, in case that the scalar charge is given by the muon number. The extensions of our calculation to the quadrupole order and hyperbolic orbit are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of the assumption of a non-flat fiducial cosmology on the measurement, analysis and interpretation of BAO distance variables, along and across the line-of-sight. The assumption about cosmology enters in the choice of the base template, as well as on the transformation of tracer's redshifts into distances (the catalog cosmology): here we focus on the curvature assumption, separately and jointly, on both. We employ BOSS and eBOSS publicly available data and show that for the statistical precision of this data set, distance measures and thus cosmological inference are robust to assumptions about curvature both of the template and the catalog. Thus the usual assumptions of flat fiducial cosmologies (but also assumptions of non-flat cosmologies) do not produce any detectable systematic effects. For forthcoming large-volume surveys, however, small but appreciable residual systematic shifts can be generated which may require some care. These are mostly driven by the choice of catalog cosmology if it is significantly different from true cosmology. In particular, the catalog (and template) cosmology should be chosen, possibly iteratively, in such a way that the recovered BAO scaling variables are sufficiently close to unity. At this level of precision, however, other previously overlooked effects become relevant, such as a mismatch between the sound horizon as seen in the BAO and the actual sound horizon in the early Universe. If unaccounted for, such effect may be misinterpreted as cosmological and thus bias the curvature (and cosmology) constraints. We present best practices to avoid this.</description>

Abstract: Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) are promising probes for clustering measurements at high redshift, $z&gt;2$, a region only covered so far by Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of selecting LBGs by exploiting the existence of a strong deficit of flux shortward of the Lyman limit, due to various absorption processes along the line of sight. The target selection relies on deep imaging data from the HSC and CLAUDS surveys in the $g,r,z$ and $u$ bands, respectively, with median depths reaching 27 AB in all bands. The selections were validated by several dedicated spectroscopic observation campaigns with DESI. Visual inspection of spectra has enabled us to develop an automated spectroscopic typing and redshift estimation algorithm specific to LBGs. Based on these data and tools, we assess the efficiency and purity of target selections optimised for different purposes. Selections providing a wide redshift coverage retain $57\%$ of the observed targets after spectroscopic confirmation with DESI, and provide an efficiency for LBGs of $83\pm3\%$, for a purity of the selected LBG sample of $90\pm2\%$. This would deliver a confirmed LBG density of $\sim 620$ deg$^{-2}$ in the range $2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5$ for a $r$-band limiting magnitude $r&lt;24.2$. Selections optimised for high redshift efficiency retain $73\%$ of the observed targets after spectroscopic confirmation, with $89\pm4\%$ efficiency for $97\pm2\%$ purity. This would provide a confirmed LBG density of $\sim 470$ deg$^{-2}$ in the range $2.8&lt;z&lt;3.5$ for a $r$-band limiting magnitude $r&lt;24.5$. A preliminary study of the LBG sample 3d-clustering properties is also presented and used to estimate the LBG linear bias. A value of $b_{LBG} = 3.3 \pm 0.2 (stat.)$ is obtained for a mean redshift of 2.9 and a limiting magnitude in $r$ of 24.2, in agreement with results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>The role of LRG1 and LRG2's monopole in inferring the DESI 2024 BAO cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02168</link>

Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration recently released its first year of data (DR1) on baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy, quasar, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest tracers. When combined with CMB and SNIa data, DESI BAO results suggest potential thawing behavior in dark energy. Cosmological analyses utilize comoving distances along ($D_H$) and perpendicular to ($D_M$) the line of sight. Notably, there are $1\sim2\sigma$ deviations in $D_M$ and $D_H$ from Planck cosmology values in the luminous red galaxies (LRG) bins LRG1 and LRG2.This study examines the role of LRG1 and LRG2 in diverging DESI 2024 BAO cosmology from Planck cosmology. We use angle-averaged distance $D_V$ and the ratio $F_{\rm AP}=D_M/D_H$, which are more directly related to the measured monopole and quadrupole components of the galaxy power spectrum or correlation function, instead of the officially adopted $D_M$ and $D_H$. This transformation aims to isolate the influence of monopoles in LRG1 and LRG2 on deviations from $w=-1$. Our findings indicate that removing the $D_V$ data point in LRG2 aligns DESI + CMB + SNIa data compilation with $w=-1$ within a $2\sigma$ contour and reduces the $H_0$ discrepancy from the Planck 2018 results from $0.63\sigma$ to $0.31\sigma$. Similarly, excluding the $D_V$ data point from LRG1 shifts the $w_0/w_a$ contour toward $w=-1$, although no intersection occurs. This highlights the preference of both LRG1 and LRG2 BAO monopole components for the thawing dark energy model, with LRG2 showing a stronger preference. We provide the $D_V$ and $F_{\rm AP}$ data and their covariance alongside this paper.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024: Constraints on Physics-Focused Aspects of Dark Energy using DESI DR1 BAO Data</title>

Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation data from the first year of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provide near percent-level precision of cosmic distances in seven bins over the redshift range $z=0.1$-$4.2$. We use this data, together with other distance probes, to constrain the cosmic expansion history using some well-motivated physical classes of dark energy. In particular, we explore three physics-focused behaviors of dark energy from the equation of state and energy density perspectives: the thawing class (matching many simple quintessence potentials), emergent class (where dark energy comes into being recently, as in phase transition models), and mirage class (where phenomenologically the distance to CMB last scattering is close to that from a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ despite dark energy dynamics). All three classes fit the data at least as well as $\Lambda$CDM, and indeed can improve on it by $\Delta\chi^2\approx -5$ to $-17$ for the combination of DESI BAO with CMB and supernova data, while having one more parameter. The mirage class does essentially as well as $w_0w_a$CDM while having one less parameter. These classes of dynamical behaviors highlight worthwhile avenues for further exploration into the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Fermi observations of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts on cosmological parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compile a \emph{Fermi} sample of the \emph{long} GRBs from \emph{Fermi} observations with 15 years of the Fermi-GBM catalogue with identified redshift, in which the GOLD sample contains 123 long GRBs at $z\le5.6$ and the FULL sample contains 151 long GRBs with redshifts at $z\le8.2$. The Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p,i}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation) are calibrated at $z&lt;1.4$ by a Gaussian Process from the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) with the cosmic chronometers method to obtain GRBs at high-redshift $z\ge1.4$ which can be used to constrain cosmological models via the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. From the cosmology-independent GRBs with the GOLD sample at $z\ge1.4$ and the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at $0.01&lt;z\leq2.3$, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.354\pm0.018, H_0 = 73.05\pm0.2 \rm km/s/Mpc$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model; $w_0 = -1.22^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ for the flat $w$CDM model; and $w_{a} = -1.12^{+0.45}_{-0.83}$ for the flat Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our results with the GOLD and FULL sample are almost identical, which are more stringent than the previous results with GRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical dark energy has gained renewed interest due to recent theoretical and observational developments. In the present paper, we focus on a string-motivated dark energy set-up, and perform a detailed cosmological analysis of exponential quintessence with potential $V=V_0 e^{-\lambda\phi}$, allowing for non-zero spatial curvature. We first gain some physical intuition into the full evolution of such a scenario by analysing the corresponding dynamical system. Then, we test the model using a combination of Planck CMB data, DESI BAO data, as well as recent supernovae datasets. For the model parameter $\lambda$, we obtain a preference for nonzero values: $\lambda = 0.48^{+0.28}_{-0.21},\; 0.68^{+0.31}_{-0.20},\; 0.77^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ at 68% C.L. when combining CMB+DESI with Pantheon+, Union3 and DES-Y5 supernovae datasets respectively. We find no significant hint for spatial curvature. We discuss the implications of current cosmological results for the exponential quintessence model, and more generally for dark energy in string theory.</description>

      <title>Halo Densities and Pericenter Distances of the Bright Milky Way Satellites as a Test of Dark Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide new constraints on the dark matter halo density profile of Milky Way (MW) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using the phase-space distribution function (DF) method. After assessing the systematics of the approach against mock data from the Gaia Challenge project, we apply the DF analysis to the entire kinematic sample of well-measured MW dwarf satellites for the first time. Contrary to previous findings for some of these objects, we find that the DF analysis yields results consistent with the standard Jeans analysis. In particular, in the present study we rediscover: i) a large diversity in the inner halo densities of dSphs (bracketed by Draco and Fornax), and ii) an anti-correlation between inner halo density and pericenter distance of the bright MW satellites. Regardless of the strength of the anti-correlation, we find that the distribution of these satellites in density vs. pericenter space is inconsistent with the results of the high-res N-body simulations that include a disk potential. Our analysis motivates further studies on the role of internal feedback and dark matter microphysics in these dSphs.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we prove analytic bounds on the equation of state of a cosmological fluid composed of an arbitrary number of canonical scalars evolving in a negative multi-exponential potential. Because of the negative energy, the universe is contracting and eventually undergoes a big crunch. A contracting universe is a fundamental feature of models of ekpyrosis and cyclic universes, which are a proposed alternative to cosmic inflation to solve the flatness and horizon problems. Our analytic bounds set quantitative constraints on general effective theories of ekpyrosis. When applied to specific top-down constructions, our bounds can be used to determine whether ekpyrosis could in principle be realized. We point out some possible sources of tension in realizing the ekpyrotic universe in controlled constructions of string theory.</description>

      <title>Hubble Diagrams in Statistically Homogeneous, Anisotropic Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the form of Hubble diagrams that would be constructed by observers in universes that are homogeneous but anisotropic, when averaged over suitably large length-scales. This is achieved by ray-tracing in different directions on the sky in families of exact inhomogeneous cosmological solutions of Einstein's equations, in order to determine the redshifts and luminosity distances that observers in these space-times would infer for distant astrophysical objects. We compare the results of this procedure to the Hubble diagrams that would be obtained by direct use of the large-scale-averaged anisotropic cosmological models, and find that observables calculated in the averaged model closely agree with those obtained from ray-tracing in all cases where a statistical homogeneity scale exists. In contrast, we find that in cosmologies with spaces that contain no statistical homogeneity scale that Hubble diagrams inferred from the averaged cosmological model can differ considerably from those that observers in the space-time would actually construct. We hope that these results will be of use for understanding and interpreting recent observations that suggest that large-scale anisotropy may have developed in the late Universe.</description>

      <title>Do galaxy mergers prefer under-dense environments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in galaxy evolution. However, the correlation between mergers and the local environment of galaxies is not fully understood. We aim to address the question of whether galaxy mergers prefer denser or less dense environments by quantifying the spatial clustering of mergers and non-mergers. We use two different indicators to classify mergers and non-mergers - classification based on a deep learning technique ($f$) and non-parametric measures of galaxy morphology, Gini-$M_{20}$ ($g$). We used a set of galaxy samples in the redshift range $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.15$ from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey with a stellar mass cut of $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot} ) &gt; 9.5$. We measured and compared the two-point correlation function (2pCF) of mergers and non-mergers classified using the two merger indicators $f$ and $g$. We measured the marked correlation function (MCF), in which the galaxies are weighted by $f$ to probe the environmental dependence of galaxy mergers. We do not observe a statistically significant difference between the clustering strengths of mergers and non-mergers obtained using 2pCF. However, using the MCF measurements with $f$ as a mark, we observe an anti-correlation between the likelihood of a galaxy being a merger and its environment. Our results emphasise the advantage of MCF over 2pCF in probing the environmental correlations. Based on the MCF measurements, we conclude that the galaxy mergers prefer to occur in the under-dense environments on scales $&gt; 50 \, h^{-1} \mathrm{kpc}$ of the large-scale structure (LSS). We attribute this observation to the high relative velocities of galaxies in the densest environments that prevent them from merging.</description>

      <title>Well-defined $f(Q)$ Gravity, Reconstruction of FLRW Spacetime and Unification of Inflation with Dark Energy Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the convenient and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravities in terms of the metric and four scalar fields with the $Q$ being the non-metricity scalar. As a result, it is shown that the obtained field equations are well-defined. By using the field equations, we show how the $f(Q)$ models which realise any given FLRW spacetime may be reconstructed. We construct convenient $f(Q)$ gravity and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravity, which describe the inflation and dark energy epochs and even unify the inflation and dark energy. Moreover, a radiation-dominated epoch and early dark energy may be easily included in the above theories as is explicitly shown. It is shown that the inflationary spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with Planck data for some models of $f(Q)$ gravity. Corresponding asymptotic forms of $f(Q)$ and mimetic $f(Q)$ are given. Finally, some remarks on possible reconstruction for spherically symmetric spacetime are given.</description>

      <title>Dust dynamics in RAMSES -- II. Equilibrium drift velocity distributions of charged dust grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gas-grain relative drift velocity distributions of charged astrophysical dust grains in MHD turbulence. We do this using a range of MHD-PIC simulations spanning different plasma-$\beta$, sonic/Alfv\'en Mach number, and with grains of varying size and charge-to-mass ratio. We find that the root-mean-square drift velocity is a strong function of the grain size, following a power law with a 1/2 slope. The r.m.s. value has only a very weak dependence on the charge-to-mass ratio. On the other hand, the shape of the distribution is a strong function of the grain charge-to-mass ratio, and in compressible turbulence, also the grain size. We then compare these results to simple analytic models based upon time-domain quasi-linear theory and solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation. These models explain qualitatively the r.m.s. drift velocity's lack of charge-to-mass ratio dependence, as well as why the shape of the distribution changes as the charge-to-mass ratio increases. Finally we scale our results to astrophysical conditions. As an example, at a length scale of one parsec in the cold neutral medium, 0.1 $\mu$m grains should be drifting at roughly 40% of the turbulent velocity dispersion. These findings may serve as a basis for a model for grain velocities in the context of grain-grain collisions, non-thermal sputtering, and accretion of metals. These findings also have implications for the transport of grains through the galaxy, suggesting that grains may have non-negligible random motions at length-scales that many modern galaxy simulations approach.</description>
