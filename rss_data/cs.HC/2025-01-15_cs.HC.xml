      <title>"Near Data" and "Far Data" for Urban Sustainability: How Do Community Advocates Envision Data Intermediaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the densifying data ecosystem of today's cities, data intermediaries are crucial stakeholders in facilitating data access and use. Community advocates live in these sites of social injustices and opportunities for change. Highly experienced in working with data to enact change, they offer distinctive insights on data practices and tools. This paper examines the unique perspectives that community advocates offer on data intermediaries. Based on interviews with 17 advocates working with 23 grassroots and nonprofit organizations, we propose the quality of "near" and "far" to be seriously considered in data intermediaries' works and articulate advocates' vision of connecting "near data" and "far data." To pursue this vision, we identified three pathways for data intermediaries: align data exploration with ways of storytelling, communicate context and uncertainties, and decenter artifacts for relationship building. These pathways help data intermediaries to put data feminism into practice, surface design opportunities and tensions, and raise key questions for supporting the pursuit of the Right to the City.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Experiences Engaging the Margins in Data-Centric Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-centric technologies provide exciting opportunities, but recent research has shown how lack of representation in datasets, often as a result of systemic inequities and socioeconomic disparities, can produce inequitable outcomes that can exclude or harm certain demographics. In this paper, we discuss preliminary insights from an ongoing effort aimed at better understanding barriers to equitable data-centric innovation. We report findings from a survey of 261 technologists and researchers who use data in their work regarding their experiences seeking adequate, representative datasets. Our findings suggest that age and identity play a significant role in the seeking and selection of representative datasets, warranting further investigation into these aspects of data-centric research and development.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Practice, Perception, and Challenge of Blind or Low Vision Students Learning through Accessible Technologies in Non-Inclusive 'Blind Colleges'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In developing and underdeveloped regions, many 'Blind Colleges' exclusively enroll individuals with Blindness or Vision Impairment (BLV) for higher education. While advancements in accessible technologies have facilitated BLV student integration into 'Integrated Colleges,' their implementation in 'Blind Colleges' remains uneven due to complex economic, social, and policy challenges. This study investigates the practices, perceptions, and challenges of BLV students using accessible technologies in a Chinese 'Blind College' through a two-part empirical approach. Our findings demonstrate that tactile and digital technologies enhance access to education but face significant integration barriers. We emphasize the critical role of early education in addressing capability gaps, BLV students' aspirations for more inclusive educational environments, and the systemic obstacles within existing frameworks. We advocate for leveraging accessible technologies to transition 'Blind Colleges' into 'Integrated Colleges,' offering actionable insights for policymakers, designers, and educators. Finally, we outline future research directions on accessible technology innovation and its implications for BLV education in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Reliable Vertical Ground Reaction Force Estimation with Smart Insole During Walking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and its characteristic weight acceptance and push-off peaks measured during walking are important for gait and biomechanical analysis. Current wearable vGRF estimation methods suffer from drifting errors or low generalization performances, limiting their practical application. This paper proposes a novel method for reliably estimating vGRF and its characteristic peaks using data collected from the smart insole, including inertial measurement unit data and the newly introduced center of the pressed sensor data. These data were fused with machine learning algorithms including artificial neural networks, random forest regression, and bi-directional long-short-term memory. The proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with the root mean squared error, normalized root mean squared error, and correlation coefficient of 0.024 body weight (BW), 1.79% BW, and 0.997 in intra-participant testing, and 0.044 BW, 3.22% BW, and 0.991 in inter-participant testing, respectively. The difference between the reference and estimated weight acceptance and push-off peak values are 0.022 BW and 0.017 BW with a delay of 1.4% and 1.8% of the gait cycle for the intra-participant testing and 0.044 BW and 0.025 BW with a delay of 1.5% and 2.3% of the gait cycle for the inter-participant testing. The results indicate that the proposed vGRF estimation method has the potential to achieve accurate vGRF measurement during walking in free living environments.</description>

      <title>Building Symbiotic AI: Reviewing the AI Act for a Human-Centred, Principle-Based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) spreads quickly as new technologies and services take over modern society. The need to regulate AI design, development, and use is strictly necessary to avoid unethical and potentially dangerous consequences to humans. The European Union (EU) has released a new legal framework, the AI Act, to regulate AI by undertaking a risk-based approach to safeguard humans during interaction. At the same time, researchers offer a new perspective on AI systems, commonly known as Human-Centred AI (HCAI), highlighting the need for a human-centred approach to their design. In this context, Symbiotic AI (a subtype of HCAI) promises to enhance human capabilities through a deeper and continuous collaboration between human intelligence and AI. This article presents the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that aims to identify principles that characterise the design and development of Symbiotic AI systems while considering humans as the core of the process. Through content analysis, four principles emerged from the review that must be applied to create Human-Centred AI systems that can establish a symbiotic relationship with humans. In addition, current trends and challenges were defined to indicate open questions that may guide future research for the development of SAI systems that comply with the AI Act.</description>

      <title>The Phase Model of Misinformation Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation is a challenging problem. This paper provides the first systematic interdisciplinary investigation of technical and non-technical interventions against misinformation. It combines interviews and a survey to understand which interventions are accepted across academic disciplines and approved by misinformation experts. Four interventions are supported by more than two in three misinformation experts: promoting media literacy, education in schools and universities, finding information about claims, and finding sources for claims. The most controversial intervention is deleting misinformation. We discuss the potentials and risks of all interventions. Education-based interventions are perceived as the most helpful by misinformation experts. Interventions focused on providing evidence are also widely perceived as helpful. We discuss them as scalable and always available interventions that empower users to independently identify misinformation. We also introduce the Phase Model of Misinformation Interventions that helps practitioners make informed decisions about which interventions to focus on and how to best combine interventions.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Assessment and Training in Extended Reality: Multimodal Systems, Clinical Utility, and Current Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) technologies-encompassing virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) are transforming cognitive assessment and training by offering immersive, interactive environments that simulate real-world tasks. XR enhances ecological validity while enabling real-time, multimodal data collection through tools such as galvanic skin response (GSR), electroencephalography (EEG), eye tracking (ET), hand tracking, and body tracking. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive and emotional processes, as well as adaptive, personalized interventions for users. Despite these advancements, current XR applications often underutilize the full potential of multimodal integration, relying primarily on visual and auditory inputs. Challenges such as cybersickness, usability concerns, and accessibility barriers further limit the widespread adoption of XR tools in cognitive science and clinical practice. This review examines XR-based cognitive assessment and training, focusing on its advantages over traditional methods, including ecological validity, engagement, and adaptability. It also explores unresolved challenges such as system usability, cost, and the need for multimodal feedback integration. The review concludes by identifying opportunities for optimizing XR tools to improve cognitive evaluation and rehabilitation outcomes, particularly for diverse populations, including older adults and individuals with cognitive impairments.</description>

      <title>Jigsaw: Authoring Immersive Storytelling Experiences with Augmented Reality and Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) presents new opportunities for immersive storytelling. However, this immersiveness faces two main hurdles. First, AR's immersive quality is often confined to visual elements, such as pixels on a screen. Second, crafting immersive narratives is complex and generally beyond the reach of amateurs due to the need for advanced technical skills. We introduce Jigsaw, a system that empowers beginners to both experience and craft immersive stories, blending virtual and physical elements. Jigsaw uniquely combines mobile AR with readily available Internet-of-things (IoT) devices. We conducted a qualitative study with 20 participants to assess Jigsaw's effectiveness in both consuming and creating immersive narratives. The results were promising: participants not only successfully created their own immersive stories but also found the playback of three such stories deeply engaging. However, sensory overload emerged as a significant challenge in these experiences. We discuss design trade-offs and considerations for future endeavors in immersive storytelling involving AR and IoT.</description>

      <title>Testing Human-Hand Segmentation on In-Distribution and Out-of-Distribution Data in Human-Robot Interactions Using a Deep Ensemble Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable detection and segmentation of human hands are critical for enhancing safety and facilitating advanced interactions in human-robot collaboration. Current research predominantly evaluates hand segmentation under in-distribution (ID) data, which reflects the training data of deep learning (DL) models. However, this approach fails to address out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios that often arise in real-world human-robot interactions. In this study, we present a novel approach by evaluating the performance of pre-trained DL models under both ID data and more challenging OOD scenarios. To mimic realistic industrial scenarios, we designed a diverse dataset featuring simple and cluttered backgrounds with industrial tools, varying numbers of hands (0 to 4), and hands with and without gloves. For OOD scenarios, we incorporated unique and rare conditions such as finger-crossing gestures and motion blur from fast-moving hands, addressing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To ensure multiple point of views (PoVs), we utilized both egocentric cameras, mounted on the operator's head, and static cameras to capture RGB images of human-robot interactions. This approach allowed us to account for multiple camera perspectives while also evaluating the performance of models trained on existing egocentric datasets as well as static-camera datasets. For segmentation, we used a deep ensemble model composed of UNet and RefineNet as base learners. Performance evaluation was conducted using segmentation metrics and uncertainty quantification via predictive entropy. Results revealed that models trained on industrial datasets outperformed those trained on non-industrial datasets, highlighting the importance of context-specific training. Although all models struggled with OOD scenarios, those trained on industrial datasets demonstrated significantly better generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As trends in education evolve, personalized learning has transformed individuals' engagement with knowledge and skill development. In the digital age, state-of-the-art technologies have been increasingly integrated into classrooms to support intelligent education and foster personalized learning experiences. One promising approach is the use of eye-tracking technology to evaluate student engagement in intelligent virtual classrooms. This paper explores the assessment of personalized learning in the virtual classroom and its impact on student engagement through the eye movement paradigm. The study aims to provide insights into how personalized learning approaches can enhance student participation, motivation, and academic performance in the online learning environment. Through a comprehensive literature review, case study, and data analysis, the paper examines the key elements of personalized learning, the methods of assessment, and the resulting effects on student engagement. The findings suggest that the eye movement paradigm has the potential to assess student engagement and promote better educational outcomes.</description>

      <title>AI Guide Dog: Egocentric Path Prediction on Smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces AI Guide Dog (AIGD), a lightweight egocentric navigation assistance system for visually impaired individuals, designed for real-time deployment on smartphones. AIGD addresses key challenges in blind navigation by employing a vision-only, multi-label classification approach to predict directional commands, ensuring safe traversal across diverse environments. We propose a novel technique to enable goal-based outdoor navigation by integrating GPS signals and high-level directions, while also addressing uncertain multi-path predictions for destination-free indoor navigation. Our generalized model is the first navigation assistance system to handle both goal-oriented and exploratory navigation scenarios across indoor and outdoor settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in blind navigation. We present methods, datasets, evaluations, and deployment insights to encourage further innovations in assistive navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Responses and Continuations Generated by Large Language Models on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using two open-source models: Gemma and Llama. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic similarity between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: Gemma shows a tendency toward negative emotion amplification, particularly anger, while maintaining certain positive emotions like optimism. Llama demonstrates superior emotional preservation across a broader spectrum of affects. Both models systematically generate responses with attenuated emotional intensity compared to human-authored content and show a bias toward positive emotions in response tasks. Additionally, both models maintain strong semantic similarity with original texts, though performance varies between continuation and response tasks. These findings provide insights into LLMs' emotional and semantic processing capabilities, with implications for their deployment in social media contexts and human-AI interaction design.</description>

      <title>CG-MER: A Card Game-based Multimodal dataset for Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of affective computing has seen significant advancements in exploring the relationship between emotions and emerging technologies. This paper presents a novel and valuable contribution to this field with the introduction of a comprehensive French multimodal dataset designed specifically for emotion recognition. The dataset encompasses three primary modalities: facial expressions, speech, and gestures, providing a holistic perspective on emotions. Moreover, the dataset has the potential to incorporate additional modalities, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) to expand the scope of emotion recognition research. The dataset was curated through engaging participants in card game sessions, where they were prompted to express a range of emotions while responding to diverse questions. The study included 10 sessions with 20 participants (9 females and 11 males). The dataset serves as a valuable resource for furthering research in emotion recognition and provides an avenue for exploring the intricate connections between human emotions and digital technologies.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal AI Copilot for Single-Cell Analysis with Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel at interpreting complex natural language instructions, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks. In the life sciences, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data serves as the "language of cellular biology", capturing intricate gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. However, interacting with this "language" through conventional tools is often inefficient and unintuitive, posing challenges for researchers. To address these limitations, we present InstructCell, a multi-modal AI copilot that leverages natural language as a medium for more direct and flexible single-cell analysis. We construct a comprehensive multi-modal instruction dataset that pairs text-based instructions with scRNA-seq profiles from diverse tissues and species. Building on this, we develop a multi-modal cell language architecture capable of simultaneously interpreting and processing both modalities. InstructCell empowers researchers to accomplish critical tasks-such as cell type annotation, conditional pseudo-cell generation, and drug sensitivity prediction-using straightforward natural language commands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that InstructCell consistently meets or exceeds the performance of existing single-cell foundation models, while adapting to diverse experimental conditions. More importantly, InstructCell provides an accessible and intuitive tool for exploring complex single-cell data, lowering technical barriers and enabling deeper biological insights.</description>

      <title>GOMA: Proactive Embodied Cooperative Communication via Goal-Oriented Mental Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verbal communication plays a crucial role in human cooperation, particularly when the partners only have incomplete information about the task, environment, and each other's mental state. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative communication framework, Goal-Oriented Mental Alignment (GOMA). GOMA formulates verbal communication as a planning problem that minimizes the misalignment between the parts of agents' mental states that are relevant to the goals. This approach enables an embodied assistant to reason about when and how to proactively initialize communication with humans verbally using natural language to help achieve better cooperation. We evaluate our approach against strong baselines in two challenging environments, Overcooked (a multiplayer game) and VirtualHome (a household simulator). Our experimental results demonstrate that large language models struggle with generating meaningful communication that is grounded in the social and physical context. In contrast, our approach can successfully generate concise verbal communication for the embodied assistant to effectively boost the performance of the cooperation as well as human users' perception of the assistant.</description>

      <title>Experiencing the Future Mundane: Configuring Design Fiction as Breaching Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodological approach for surfacing the acceptability and adoption challenges that confront future and emerging technologies from the perspective of mundane action, in which they will ultimately be embedded and used. This novel approach configures design fiction as a breaching experiment to surface taken for granted background expectancies that are fateful for acceptability and adoption. We explain the logic of this new interdisciplinary method and present a concrete case to demonstrate its viability: a design fiction called Experiencing the Future Mundane (EFM), which depicts a future world in which watching TV is driven by smart adaptive media. We explicate the design of the EFM, how it was configured to breach common sense knowledge and surface taken for granted background expectancies concerning how watching TV works and is expected to work, the acceptability and adoption challenges that emerge from user engagement with the experience, and how this novel approach may be adopted more broadly.</description>

      <title>Scideator: Human-LLM Scientific Idea Generation Grounded in Research-Paper Facet Recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scientific ideation process often involves blending salient aspects of existing papers to create new ideas. To see if large language models (LLMs) can assist this process, we contribute Scideator, a novel mixed-initiative tool for scientific ideation. Starting from a user-provided set of papers, Scideator extracts key facets (purposes, mechanisms, and evaluations) from these and relevant papers, allowing users to explore the idea space by interactively recombining facets to synthesize inventive ideas. Scideator also helps users to gauge idea novelty by searching the literature for potential overlaps and showing automated novelty assessments and explanations. To support these tasks, Scideator introduces four LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) modules: Analogous Paper Facet Finder, Faceted Idea Generator, Idea Novelty Checker, and Idea Novelty Iterator. In a within-subjects user study, 19 computer-science researchers identified significantly more interesting ideas using Scideator compared to a strong baseline combining a scientific search engine with LLM interaction.</description>

      <title>Biologically-Inspired Technologies: Integrating Brain-Computer Interface and Neuromorphic Computing for Human Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of immersive communication into a human-centric ecosystem has intensified the demand for sophisticated Human Digital Twins (HDTs) driven by multifaceted human data. However, the effective construction of HDTs faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of data collection devices, the high energy demands associated with processing intricate data, and concerns over the privacy of sensitive information. This work introduces a novel biologically-inspired (bio-inspired) HDT framework that leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensor technology to capture brain signals as the data source for constructing HDT. By collecting and analyzing these signals, the framework not only minimizes device heterogeneity and enhances data collection efficiency, but also provides richer and more nuanced physiological and psychological data for constructing personalized HDTs. To this end, we further propose a bio-inspired neuromorphic computing learning model based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This model utilizes discrete neural spikes to emulate the way of human brain processes information, thereby enhancing the system's ability to process data effectively while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we integrate a Federated Learning (FL) strategy within the model to strengthen data privacy. We then conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance of our proposed twofold bio-inspired scheme. Finally, we present several challenges and promising directions for future research of HDTs driven by bio-inspired technologies.</description>

      <title>Virtual Reflections on a Dynamic 2D Eye Model Improve Spatial Reference Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The visible orientation of human eyes creates some transparency about people's spatial attention and other mental states. This leads to a dual role for the eyes as a means of sensing and communication. Accordingly, artificial eye models are being explored as communication media in human-machine interaction scenarios. One challenge in the use of eye models for communication consists of resolving spatial reference ambiguities, especially for screen-based models. Here, we introduce an approach for overcoming this challenge through the introduction of reflection-like features that are contingent on artificial eye movements. We conducted a user study with 30 participants in which participants had to use spatial references provided by dynamic eye models to advance in a fast-paced group interaction task. Compared to a non-reflective eye model and a pure reflection mode, their combination in the new approach resulted in a higher identification accuracy and user experience, suggesting a synergistic benefit.</description>

      <title>Cocoa: Co-Planning and Co-Execution with AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Cocoa, a system that implements a novel interaction design pattern -- interactive plans -- for users to collaborate with an AI agent on complex, multi-step tasks in a document editor. Cocoa harmonizes human and AI efforts and enables flexible delegation of agency through two actions: Co-planning (where users collaboratively compose a plan of action with the agent) and Co-execution (where users collaboratively execute plan steps with the agent). Using scientific research as a sample domain, we motivate the design of Cocoa through a formative study with 9 researchers while also drawing inspiration from the design of computational notebooks. We evaluate Cocoa through a user study with 16 researchers and find that when compared to a strong chat baseline, Cocoa improved agent steerability without sacrificing ease of use. A deeper investigation of the general utility of both systems uncovered insights into usage contexts where interactive plans may be more appropriate than chat, and vice versa. Our work surfaces numerous practical implications and paves new paths for interactive interfaces that foster more effective collaboration between humans and agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>Balancing Exploration and Cybersickness: Investigating Curiosity-Driven Behavior in Virtual Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During virtual navigation, users exhibit varied interaction and navigation behaviors influenced by several factors. Existing theories and models have been developed to explain and predict these diverse patterns. While users often experience uncomfortable sensations, such as cybersickness, during virtual reality (VR) use, they do not always make optimal decisions to mitigate these effects. Although methods like reinforcement learning have been used to model decision-making processes, they typically rely on random selection to simulate actions, failing to capture the complexities of real navigation behavior. In this study, we propose curiosity as a key factor driving irrational decision-making, suggesting that users continuously balance exploration and cybersickness according to the free energy principle during virtual navigation. Our findings show that VR users generally adopt conservative strategies when navigating, with most participants displaying negative curiosity across trials. However, curiosity levels tend to rise when the virtual environment changes, illustrating the dynamic interplay between exploration and discomfort. This study provides a quantitative approach to decoding curiosity-driven behavior during virtual navigation, offering insights into how users balance exploration and the avoidance of cybersickness. Future research will further refine this model by incorporating additional psychological and environmental factors to improve the accuracy of navigation pattern predictions.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of sensory encoding models for human navigation in virtual reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In virtual reality applications, users often navigate through virtual environments, but the issue of physiological responses, such as cybersickness, fatigue, and cognitive workload, can disrupt or even halt these activities. Despite its impact, the underlying mechanisms of how the sensory system encodes information in VR remain unclear. In this study, we compare three sensory encoding models, Bayesian Efficient Coding, Fitness Maximizing Coding, and the Linear Nonlinear Poisson model, regarding their ability to simulate human navigation behavior in VR. By incorporating the factor of physiological responses into the models, we find that the Bayesian Efficient Coding model generally outperforms the others. Furthermore, the Fitness Maximizing Code framework provides more accurate estimates when the error penalty is small. Our results suggest that the Bayesian Efficient Coding framework offers superior predictions in most scenarios, providing a better understanding of human navigation behavior in VR environments.</description>

      <title>MambaTalk: Efficient Holistic Gesture Synthesis with Selective State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09471v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gesture synthesis is a vital realm of human-computer interaction, with wide-ranging applications across various fields like film, robotics, and virtual reality. Recent advancements have utilized the diffusion model and attention mechanisms to improve gesture synthesis. However, due to the high computational complexity of these techniques, generating long and diverse sequences with low latency remains a challenge. We explore the potential of state space models (SSMs) to address the challenge, implementing a two-stage modeling strategy with discrete motion priors to enhance the quality of gestures. Leveraging the foundational Mamba block, we introduce MambaTalk, enhancing gesture diversity and rhythm through multimodal integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Smartphone-based Eye Tracking System using Edge Intelligence and Model Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant limitation of current smartphone-based eye-tracking algorithms is their low accuracy when applied to video-type visual stimuli, as they are typically trained on static images. Also, the increasing demand for real-time interactive applications like games, VR, and AR on smartphones requires overcoming the limitations posed by resource constraints such as limited computational power, battery life, and network bandwidth. Therefore, we developed two new smartphone eye-tracking techniques for video-type visuals by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with two different Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), namely Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Our CNN+LSTM and CNN+GRU models achieved an average Root Mean Square Error of 0.955 cm and 1.091 cm, respectively. To address the computational constraints of smartphones, we developed an edge intelligence architecture to enhance the performance of smartphone-based eye tracking. We applied various optimisation methods like quantisation and pruning to deep learning models for better energy, CPU, and memory usage on edge devices, focusing on real-time processing. Using model quantisation, the model inference time in the CNN+LSTM and CNN+GRU models was reduced by 21.72% and 19.50%, respectively, on edge devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, analysis of unstructured textual data presents significant challenges for analysis and decision making. Uncovering patterns within large-scale corpora and understanding their semantic impact is critical, but depends on domain experts or resource-intensive manual reviews. In response, we introduce Spacewalker in this system demonstration paper, an interactive tool designed to analyze, explore, and annotate data across multiple modalities. It allows users to extract data representations, visualize them in low-dimensional spaces and traverse large datasets either exploratory or by querying regions of interest. We evaluated Spacewalker through extensive experiments and annotation studies, assessing its efficacy in improving data integrity verification and annotation. We show that Spacewalker reduces time and effort compared to traditional methods. The code of this work is open-source and can be found at: https://github.com/code-lukas/Spacewalker</description>

      <title>AI Foundation Models for Wearable Movement Data in Mental Health Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained foundation models and transformer architectures have driven the success of large language models (LLMs) and other modern AI breakthroughs. However, similar advancements in health data modeling remain limited due to the need for innovative adaptations. Wearable movement data offers a valuable avenue for exploration, as it's a core feature in nearly all commercial smartwatches, well established in clinical and mental health research, and the sequential nature of the data shares similarities to language. We introduce the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open source foundation model designed for time-series wearable movement data. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and novel techniques, such as patch embeddings, and pretraining on data from 29,307 participants in a national U.S. sample, PAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in several mental health prediction tasks. PAT is also lightweight and easily interpretable, making it a robust tool for mental health research.
