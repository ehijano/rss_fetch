      <title>Comparison between solutions to the linear peridynamics model and solutions to the classical wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an equation inspired by linear peridynamics and we establish its connection with the classical wave equation.
  In particular, given a horizon $\delta&gt;0$ accounting for the region of influence around a material point, we prove existence and uniqueness of a solution $u_\delta$ and demonstrate the convergence of $u_\delta$ to solutions to the classical wave equation as $\delta \to 0$.
  Moreover, we prove that the solutions to the peridynamics model with small frequency initial data are close to solutions to the classical wave equation.</description>

      <title>Extended Divergence-Measure Fields, the Gauss-Green Formula, and Cauchy Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the Gauss-Green formula for extended divergence-measure fields (i.e., vector-valued measures whose distributional divergences are Radon measures) over open sets. We prove that, for almost every open set, the normal trace is a measure supported on the boundary of the set. Moreover, for any open set, we provide a representation of the normal trace of the field over the boundary of the open set as the limit of measure-valued normal traces over the boundaries of approximating sets. Furthermore, using this theory, we extend the balance law from classical continuum physics to a general framework in which the production on any open set is measured with a Radon measure and the associated Cauchy flux is bounded by a Radon measure concentrated on the boundary of the set. We prove that there exists an extended divergence-measure field such that the Cauchy flux can be recovered through the field, locally on almost every open set and globally on every open set. Our results generalize the classical Cauchy's Theorem (that is only valid for continuous vector fields) and extend the previous formulations of the Cauchy flux (that generate vector fields within $L^{p}$). Thereby, we establish the equivalence between entropy solutions of the multidimensional nonlinear partial differential equations of divergence form and of the mathematical formulation of physical balance laws via the Cauchy flux through the constitutive relations in the axiomatic foundation of Continuum Physics.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and uniform-in-time vanishing damping limit for the inviscid Oldroyd-B model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider global strong solutions and uniform-in-time vanishing damping limit for the inviscid Oldroyd-B model in R^d, where d=2 and 3. The well-recognized problem of the global existence of smooth solutions for the 2D inviscid Oldroyd-B model without smallness assumptions is open due to the complex structure of Q. Therefore improving the smallness assumptions, especially in lower regularity class, is the core question in the area of fluid models. On the other hand, long-time behaviors of solutions including temporal decay and uniform-in-time damping stability are also of deep significance. These problems have been widely studied, however, the existing results are not regularity critical and the (uniform) vanishing damping limit has not been discussed. The goal of this work is to dig deeper in this direction.
  In this work we first establish the local well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard with critical regularity. Then, by virtue of the sharp commutator estimate for Calderon-Zygmund operator, we establish the global existence of solutions for d=2 with damping in the low regularity class, which to our best knowledge, is novel in the literature. Furthermore, in both 2D and 3D cases, we prove the global existence of the solutions to the inviscid Oldroyd-B model independent of the damping parameters. In addition, we obtain the optimal temporal decay rates and time integrability by improving the existing Fourier splitting method and developing a novel decomposition strategy. One of the major contributions of the presenting paper is to prove the uniform-in-time vanishing damping limit for the inviscid Oldroyd-B model and discover the correlation between sharp vanishing damping rate and the temporal decay rate. Finally, we will support our findings by providing numerical evidence regarding the vanishing damping limit in the periodic domain T^d.</description>

      <title>Existence of nontrivial solutions to a critical Kirchhoff equation with a logarithmic type perturbation in dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a critical Kirchhoff equation with a logarithmic type subcritical term in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is considered. We view this problem as a critical elliptic equation with a nonlocal perturbation, and investigate how the nonlocal term affects the existence of weak solutions to the problem. By means of Ekeland's variational principle, Br\'{e}zis-Lieb's lemma and some convergence tricks for nonlocal problems, we show that this problem admits at least one weak solution which is a local minimum of the energy functional or a least energy solution, under some appropriate assumptions on the parameters. Compared with the ones obtained in [Adv. Nonlinear Stud., 23(1)(2023), No.20220049, 22 pp] and [J. Geom. Anal., 34(6)(2024), No. 182, 44 pp], our results show that the introduction of the nonlocal term enlarges the ranges of the parameters such that the problem admits weak solutions, which implies that the nonlocal term has a positive effect on the existence of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of an obstacle problem with highly oscillating coefficients and obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the viscosity method for the homogenization of an obstacle problem with highly oscillating obstacles. The associated operator, in non-divergence form, is linear and elliptic with variable coefficients. We first construct a highly oscillating corrector, which captures the singular behavior of solutions near periodically distributed holes of critical size. We then prove the uniqueness of a critical value that encodes the coupled effects of oscillations in both the coefficients and the obstacles.</description>

      <title>Global refined Fujita-Kato solution of 3-D inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with large density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global unique Fujita-Kato solution to the 3-D inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with initial velocity $u_0$ being sufficiently small in critical spaces and with initial density being bounded from above and below. We first prove the global existence of Fujita-Kato solution to the system if we assume in addition that the initial velocity is in the critical Sobolev space. While under the additional assumptions that the initial velocity is in the critical Besov space and initial density is in a critical Besov space, we prove that the solutions are controlled by the norm of the initial data. Our results not only improve the smallness condition in the previous references for the initial velocity concerning the global Fujita-Kato solution of the system but also improve the exponential-in-time growth estimate for the solution in the paper [Abidi-Gui-Zhang, ARMA 2012] to be the uniform-in-time estimate.</description>

      <title>A quantitative symmetry result for $p$-Laplace equations with discontinuous nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study positive solutions $u$ of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the $p$-Laplace equation $-\Delta_p \,u=f(u)$ in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, where $N\ge 2$, $1&lt;p&lt;+\infty$ and $f$ is a discontinuous function. We address the quantitative stability of a Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg type symmetry result for $u$, which was established by Lions and Serra when $\Omega$ is a ball. By exploiting a quantitative version of the P\'olya-Szeg\"o principle, we prove that the deviation of $u$ from its Schwarz symmetrization can be estimated in terms of the isoperimetric deficit of $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Approximation of a compound-exchanging cell by a Dirac point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication between single cells or higher organisms by means of diffusive compounds is an important phenomenon in biological systems. Modelling therefore often occurs, most straightforwardly by a diffusion equation with suitable flux boundary conditions at the cell boundaries. Such a model will become computationally inefficient and analytically complex when there are many cells, even more so when they are moving. We propose to consider instead a point source model. Each cell is virtually reduced to a point and appears in the diffusion equation for the compound on the full spatial domain as a singular reaction term in the form of a Dirac delta `function' (measure) located at the cell's centre. In this model, it has an amplitude that is a non-local function of the concentration of compound on the (now virtual) cell boundary. We prove the well-posedness of this particular parabolic problem with non-local and singular reaction term in suitable Sobolev spaces. We show for a square bounded domain and for the plane that the solution cannot be $H^1$-smooth at the Dirac point. Further, we show a preliminary numerical comparison between the solutions to the two models that suggests that the two models are highly comparable to each other.</description>

      <title>Boundary spike-layer solutions of the singular Keller-Segel system: existence, profiles and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the boundary-layer solutions of the singular Keller-Segel model proposed by Keller-Segel (1971) in a multi-dimensional domain, where the zero-flux boundary condition is imposed to the cell while inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition to the nutrient. The steady-state problem of the Keller-Segel system is reduced to a scalar Dirichlet nonlocal elliptic problem with singularity. Studying this nonlocal problem, we obtain the unique steady-state solution which possesses a boundary spike-layer profile as nutrient diffusion coefficient $\varepsilon&gt;0$ tends to zero. When the domain is radially symmetric, we find the explicit expansion for the slope of boundary-layer profiles at the boundary and boundary-layer thickness in terms of the radius as $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is small, which pinpoints how the boundary curvature affects the boundary-layer profile and thickness. Furthermore, we establish the nonlinear exponential stability of the boundary-layer steady-state solution for the radially symmetric domain. The main challenge encountered in the analysis is that the singularity will arise when the nutrient diffusion coefficient $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is small for both stationary and time-dependent problems. By relegating the nonlocal steady-state problem to local problems and performing a delicate analysis using the barrier method and Fermi coordinates, we can obtain refined estimates for the solution of local steady-state problem near the boundary. This strategy finally helps us to find the asymptotic profile of the solution to the nonlocal problem as $\varepsilon \to 0$ so that the singularity is accurately captured and hence properly handled to achieve our results.</description>

      <title>Large Time Behavior for Acoustic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with the time-domain acoustic wave propagation in the presence of a subwavelength resonator given by a Minneart bubble. This bubble is small scaled and enjoys high contrasting mass density and bulk modulus. It is well known that, under certain regimes between these scales, such a bubble generates a single low-frequency (or subwavelength) resonance called Minnaert resonance. In this paper, we study the wave propagation governed by Minnaert resonance effects in time domain. We derive the point-approximation expansion of the wave field. The dominant part is a sum of two terms.
  1. The first one, which we call the primary wave, is the wave field generated in the absence of the bubble.
  2. The second one, which we call the resonant wave, is generated by the interaction between the bubble and the background. It is related to a Dirac-source, in space, that is modulated, in time, with a coefficient which is a solution of a $1$D Cauchy problem, for a second order differential equation, having as propagation and attenuation parameters the real and the imaginary parts, respectively, of the Minnaert resonance.
  We show that the evolution of the resonant wave remains valid for a large time of the order $\epsilon^{-1}$, where $\epsilon$ is the radius of the bubble, after which it collapses by exponentially decaying. Precisely, we confirm that such resonant wave have life-time inversely proportional to the imaginary part of the related subwavelength resonances, which is in our case given by the Minnaert one. In addition, the real part of this resonance fixes the period of the wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we first prove existence of minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes energy for liquid crystals with homogeneous external magnetic field and strong uniaxial planar anchoring. Next we consider the asymptotics of solutions to the joint minimization of the energy w.r.t. the function and its boundary condition. This constitutes a generalization to arbitrary regular particle shapes of the results obtained in [BLS2024] for $\lambda=\infty$. Moreover we show the absence of line singularities in some asymptotic parameter regimes. Finally we characterize the optimal orientation of particles vis-\`a-vis the magnetic field direction and compute it explicitly for different particle shapes.</description>

      <title>On a Divergence Penalized Landau-de Gennes Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief introduction to a divergence penalized Landau-de Gennes functional as a toy model for the study of nematic liquid crystal with colloid inclusion, in the case of unequal elastic constants. We assume that the nematic occupies the exterior of the unit ball, satisfies homeotropic anchoring at the surface of the colloid and approaches a uniform uniaxial state as $|x|\to\infty$. We study the "small particle" limit and obtain a representation formula for solutions to the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. We also present a numerical analysis of these equations based on a finite element approach and discuss the effect of the divergence penalization on the "Saturn ring" defects and on the properties of the $Q$-tensor.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of linear waves with inhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear damped and viscoelastic wave equations evolving on a bounded domain. For both models, we assume that waves are subject to an inhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition on a portion of the domain's boundary. The analysis of these models presents additional interesting features and challenges compared to their homogeneous counterparts. In the present context, energy depends on the boundary trace of velocity. It is not clear in advance how this quantity should be controlled based on the given data, due to regularity issues. However, we establish global existence and also prove uniform stabilization of solutions with decay rates characterized by the Neumann input. We supplement these results with numerical simulations in which the data do not necessarily satisfy the given assumptions for decay. These simulations provide, at a numerical level, insights into how energy could possibly change in the presence of, for example, improper data.</description>

      <title>Inverse initial problem under Nash strategy for stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a multi-objective inverse initial problem with a Nash strategy constraint for forward stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with dynamic boundary conditions, where both the volume and surface equations are influenced by randomness. The objective is twofold: first, we maintain the state close to prescribed targets in fixed regions using two controls; second, we determine the history of the solution from observations at the final time. To achieve this, we establish new Carleman estimates for forward and backward equations, which are used to prove an interpolation inequality for a coupled forward-backward stochastic system. Consequently, we obtain two results: backward uniqueness and a conditional stability estimate for the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>A sharp threshold for Trudinger-Moser type inequalities with logarithmic kernels in dimension N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we investigate Trudinger-Moser type inequalities in presence of logarithmic kernels in dimension N. A sharp threshold, depending on N, is detected for the existence of estremal functions or blow-up, where the domain is the ball or the entire space. We also show that the extremal functions satisfy suitable Euler-Lagrange equations. When the domain is the entire space, such equation can be derived by N-Laplacian Schrodinger equation strongly coupled with a higher order fractional Poisson's equation. The results extends [16] to any dimension N bigger than 2.</description>

      <title>Stability for inverse random source problems of the polyharmonic wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates stability estimates for inverse source problems in the stochastic polyharmonic wave equation, where the source is represented by white noise. The study examines the well-posedness of the direct problem and derives stability estimates for identifying the strength of the random source. Assuming a priori information of the regularity and support of the source strength, the H\"{o}lder stability is established in the absence of a potential. In the more challenging case where a potential is present, the logarithmic stability estimate is obtained by constructing specialized solutions to the polyharmonic wave equation.</description>

      <title>Aggregation-diffusion equations with saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on a family of nonlinear continuity equations for the evolution of a non-negative density $\rho$ with a continuous and compactly supported nonlinear mobility $\mathrm{m}(\rho)$ not necessarily concave. The velocity field is the negative gradient of the variation of a free energy including internal and confinement energy terms. Problems with compactly supported mobility are often called saturation problems since the values of the density are constrained below a maximal value. Taking advantage of a family of approximating problems, we show the existence of $C_0$-semigroups of $L^1$ contractions. We study the $\omega$-limit of the problem, its most relevant properties, and the appearance of free boundaries in the long-time behaviour. This problem has a formal gradient-flow structure, and we discuss the local/global minimisers of the corresponding free energy in the natural topology related to the set of initial data for the $L^\infty$-constrained gradient flow of probability densities. Furthermore, we analyse a structure preserving implicit finite-volume scheme and discuss its convergence and long-time behaviour.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for 1D cubic defocusing dispersive equations, Part IV: general dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broad conjecture, formulated by the authors in earlier work, reads as follows: "Cubic defocusing dispersive one dimensional flows with small initial data have global dispersive solutions". Notably, here smallness is only assumed in $H^s$ Sobolev spaces, without any localization assumption.
  The conjecture was initially proved by the authors first for a class of semilinear Schr\"odinger type models, and then for quasilinear Schr\"odinger flows. In this work we take the next natural step, and prove the above conjecture for a much larger class of one dimensional semilinear dispersive problems with a cubic nonlinearity, where the dispersion relation is no longer of Schr\"odinger type.
  This result is the first of its kind, for any 1D cubic problem not of Schr\"odinger type. Furthermore, it only requires initial data smallness at critical regularity, a threshold that has never been reached before for any 1D cubic dispersive flow. In terms of dispersive decay, we prove that our global in time solutions satisfy both global $L^6_{t,x}$ Strichartz estimates and bilinear $L^2_{t,x}$ bounds.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the stochastic heat equation and results on the density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10115v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation with nonlinear Lipschitz coefficients and Dirichlet boundary conditions. We apply Malliavin calculus to this equation; we show that the solution $u \in L_{1,2}$ and provide a different proof for the existence of a density for $u$ that relies on a localization argument. This type of localization has been used before for other SPDE. However, our proof for the existence of a density for the solution to the stochastic heat equation follows a different strategy and is more involved due to new difficulties arising with the heat kernel. We also prove the existence of a density for the supremum of $u$ and that it belongs in $D_{1,2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we obtain a nonlocal version of the Alexandrov Theorem which asserts that the only set with sufficiently smooth boundary and of constant nonlocal mean curvature is an Euclidean ball. We consider a general nonlocal mean curvature given by a radial and monotone kernel and we formulate an easy-to-check condition which is necessary and sufficient for the nonlocal version of the Alexandrov Theorem to hold in the treated context. Our definition encompasses numerous examples of various nonlocal mean curvatures that have been already studied in the literature. To prove the main result we obtain a specific formula for the tangential derivative of the nonlocal mean curvature and combine it with an application of the method of moving planes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation, movement and gluing of clusters can be described through a system of non local balance laws. Here, the well posedness of this system is obtained, as well as various stability estimates. Remarkably, qualitative properties of the solutions are proved, providing information on stationary solutions and on the propagation speed. In some cases, fragmentation leads to clusters developing independently.
  Moreover, these equations may serve as an encryption/decryption tool. This poses new analytical problems and asks for improved numerical methods.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Mean Field Limit for the Vlasov-Poisson System for Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson system for ions is a kinetic equation for dilute, unmagnetised plasma. It describes the evolution of the ions in a plasma under the assumption that the electrons are thermalized. Consequently, the Poisson coupling for the electrostatic potential contains an additional exponential nonlinearity not present in the electron Vlasov-Poisson system.
  The system can be formally derived through a mean field limit from a microscopic system of ions interacting with a thermalized electron distribution. However, it is an open problem to justify this limit rigorously for ions modelled as point charges. Existing results on the derivation of the three-dimensional ionic Vlasov-Poisson system require a truncation of the singularity in the Coulomb interaction at spatial scales of order $N^{- \beta}$ with $\beta &lt; 1/15$, which is more restrictive than the available results for the electron Vlasov-Poisson system.
  In this article, we prove that the Vlasov-Poisson system for ions can be derived from a microscopic system of ions and thermalized electrons with interaction truncated at scale $N^{- \beta}$ with $\beta &lt; 1/3$. We develop a generalisation of the probabilistic approach to mean field limits that is applicable to interaction forces defined through a nonlinear coupling with the particle density. The proof is based on a quantitative uniform law of large numbers for convolutions between empirical measures of independent, identically distributed random variables and locally Lipschitz functions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Landau-Coulomb equation for initial data with bounded mass, finite numbers of moments, and entropy. We show the existence of a global weak solution that has bounded Fisher information for positive times. This solution is therefore a global strong solution away from the initial time. We propose an alternative approach, based on already existing estimates, to the study of the appearance of Fisher information recently performed by Ji in [12].</description>

      <title>The impact of different degrees of leadership on collective navigation in follower-leader systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In both animal and cell populations, the presence of leaders often underlies the success of collective migration processes, which we characterise by a group maintaining a cohesive configuration that consistently moves toward a target. We extend a recent non-local hyperbolic model for follower-leader systems to investigate different degrees of leadership. Specifically, we consider three levels of leadership: indifferent leaders, who do not alter their movement according to followers; observant leaders, who attempt to remain connected with the followers, but do not allow followers to affect their desired alignment; and persuadable leaders, who integrate their attempt to reach some target with the alignment of all neighbours, both followers and leaders. A combination of analysis and numerical simulations is used to investigate under which conditions each degree of leadership allows successful collective movement to a destination. We find that the indifferent leaders' strategy can result in a cohesive and target-directed migration only for short times. Observant and persuadable leaders instead provide robust guidance, showing that the optimal leader behavior depends on the connection between the migrating individuals: if alignment is low, greater follower influence on leaders is beneficial for successful guidance; otherwise, it can be detrimental and may generate various unsuccessful swarming dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Performance of 2D Local Inertial Hydrodynamic Models for Urban Drainage and Dam-Break Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate flood modeling is crucial for effective analysis and forecasting. Full momentum hydrodynamic models often require extensive computational time, sometimes exceeding the forecast horizon. In contrast, low-complexity models, like local-inertial approximations, provide accurate results in subcritical flows but may have limited skillfulness in supercritical conditions. This paper explores two main aspects: (i) the impact of urban infrastructure on 2D hydrodynamic modeling without detailed sewer and drainage data, and (ii) the accuracy of 2D local-inertial modeling using three numerical schemes (original formulation, s-centered, and s-upwind) in a dam-break scenario on complex, flat terrain. The HydroPol2D model is benchmarked against HEC-RAS 2D full momentum solver. We present one numerical case study and three real-world scenarios in S\~ao Paulo, Brazil: a detention pond with a $1$ in $100$-year inflow, a highly urbanized catchment with a $1$ in $50$-year hyetograph, and a dam-break scenario threatening a coastal city of nearly 200,000 residents. Results show that the model accurately simulates internal boundary conditions, achieving peak errors under 5\% compared to HEC-RAS 2D. However, neglecting urban infrastructure can lead to a 17.5\% difference in peak discharges at the outlet and significant mismatches in hydrographs, with computational times nearly doubling. The dam-break scenario demonstrates good predictive performance for maximum flood depths (CSI = $0.95$ for the original model, $0.92$ for s-centered, and $0.89$ for s-upwind), though the model's lack of convective inertia results in faster flood wave propagation than the full momentum solver. Notably, HydroPol2D is 23 times faster than HEC-RAS 2D, making it well-suited for simulating dam collapses in forecasting systems and capable of modeling urban drainage infrastructure such as orifices, weirs, and pumps.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities on non-compact Euclidean submanifolds: sharpness and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to provide Michael-Simon-type $L^p$-logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities on complete, not necessarily compact $n$-dimensional submanifolds $\Sigma$ of the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n+m}$. Our first result, stated for $p=2$, is sharp, it is valid on general submanifolds, and it involves the mean curvature of $\Sigma$. It implies in particular the main result of S. Brendle [Comm. Pure Appl. Math.}, 2022]. In addition, it turns out that equality can only occur if and only if $\Sigma$ is isometric to the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n}$ and the extremizer is a Gaussian. The second result is a general $L^p$-logarithmic-Sobolev inequality for $p\geq 2$ on Euclidean submanifolds with constants that are codimension-free in case of minimal submanifolds. In order to prove the above results - especially, to deal with the equality cases - we elaborate the theory of optimal mass transport on submanifolds between measures that are not necessarily compactly supported. Applications are provided to sharp hypercontractivity estimates of Hopf-Lax semigroups on submanifolds. The first hypercontractivity estimate is for general submanifolds with bounded mean curvature vector, the second one is for self-similar shrinkers endowed with the natural Gaussian measure. The equality cases are characterized here as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two notions of controllability on a parabolic system with coupling terms of order one. Based on existing results on, on one side parabolic systems with coupling terms of order zero, and on the other one parabolic systems with coupling terms of order one where the control domain is an interval, we give here some controllability conditions in the case where the coupling term is of order one and the control domain is not necessarily an interval.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with non-local singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study a family of self-adjoint realizations of the Laplacian in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with a new type of transmission conditions along a closed bi-Lipschitz curve $\Sigma$. These conditions incorporate jumps in the Dirichlet traces both of the functions in the operator domains and of their Wirtinger derivatives and are non-local. Constructing a convenient generalized boundary triple, they may be parametrized by all compact hermitian operators in $L^2(\Sigma;\mathbb{C}^2)$. Whereas for all choices of parameters the essential spectrum is stable and equal to $[0, +\infty)$, the discrete spectrum exhibits diverse behaviour. While in many cases it is finite, we will describe also a class of parameters for which the discrete spectrum is infinite and accumulates at $-\infty$. The latter class contains a non-local version of the oblique transmission conditions. Finally, we will connect the current model to its relativistic counterpart studied recently in [L. Heriban, M. Tu\v{s}ek: Non-local relativistic $\delta$-shell interactions].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S. Banach famously related the smoothness of a function to the size of its level sets. More precisely, he showed that a continuous function is of bounded variation exactly when its "indicatrix" is integrable. In a similar vein, we connect the smoothness of the function -- measured now by its integral modulus of continuity -- to the structure of its \emph{superlevel} sets. Our approach ultimately reduces to a continuum incidence problem for quantifying the regularity of open sets. The pay off is a refinement of Banach's original theorem and an answer to a question of Garsia--Sawyer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromonic liquid crystals are lyotropic nematic phases whose applications span from food to drug industries. It has recently been suggested that the elastic energy density governing the equilibrium distortions of these materials may be quartic in the measure of twist. Here we show that the non-linear twist-wave equation associated with such an energy has smooth solutions that break down in a finite time, giving rise to the formation of a shock wave, under rather generic assumptions on the initial profile. The critical time at which smooth solutions become singular is estimated analytically with an accuracy that numerical calculations for a number of exemplary cases prove to be satisfactory.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the global well-posedness of classical solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in 3D domains D under non-slip boundary conditions. D will separate into the inner and boundary parts along a free surface: In the inner part, the density is allowed to vanish and the gradient of it grows with an exponential rate when vacuum appears initially; while in the boundary part, no vacuum forms and the higher order derivatives of the density remain uniformly bounded. We utilize the Lagrangian coordinates introduced by Christodoulou-Lindblad to study such dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Geometric analysis of fast-slow PDEs with fold singularities via Galerkin discretisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a singularly perturbed fast-slow system of two partial differential equations (PDEs) of reaction-diffusion type on a bounded domain via Galerkin discretisation. We assume that the reaction kinetics in the fast variable realise a generic fold singularity, whereas the slow variable takes the role of a dynamic bifurcation parameter, thus extending the classical analysis of the singularly perturbed fold. Our approach combines a spectral Galerkin discretisation with techniques from geometric singular perturbation theory which are applied to the resulting high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations. In particular, we show the existence of invariant slow manifolds in the phase space of the original system of PDEs away from the fold singularity, while the passage past the singularity of the Galerkin manifolds obtained after discretisation is described by geometric desingularisation, or blow-up. Finally, we discuss the relation between these Galerkin manifolds and the underlying slow manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We establish local H\"older estimates for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear second order equations with quadratic growth in the gradient and unbounded right-hand side in $L^q$ spaces, for an integrability threshold $q$ guaranteeing the validity of the maximum principle. This is done through a nonlinear Harnack inequality for nonhomogeneous equations driven by a uniformly elliptic Isaacs operator and perturbed by a Hamiltonian term with natural growth in the gradient. As a byproduct, we derive a new Liouville property for entire $L^p$ viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear equations as well as a nonlinear Calder\'on-Zygmund estimate for strong solutions of such equations.</description>

      <title>A closure theorem for $\Gamma$-convergence and H-convergence with applications to non-periodic homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we examine the stability of some classes of integrals, and in particular with respect to homogenization. The prototypical case is the homogenization of quadratic energies with periodic coefficients perturbed by a term vanishing at infinity, which has been recently examined in the framework of elliptic PDE. We use localization techniques and higher-integrability Meyers-type results to provide a closure theorem by $\Gamma$-convergence within a large class of integral functionals. From such result we derive stability theorems in homogenization which comprise the case of perturbations with zero average on the whole space. The results are also extended to the stochastic case, and specialized to the $G$-convergence of operators corresponding to quadratic forms. A corresponding analysis is also carried on for non-symmetric operators using the localization properties of $H$-convergence. Finally, we treat the case of perforated domains with Neumann boundary condition, and their stability.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection between Navier-slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Rayeigh-B\'enard convection problem between Navier-slip fixed-temperature boundary conditions and present a new upper bound for the Nusselt number. The result, based on a localization principle for the Nusselt number and an interpolation bound, exploits the regularity of the flow. On one hand our method yields a shorter proof of the celebrated result in Whitehead &amp; Doering (2011) in the case of free-slip boundary conditions. On the other hand, its combination with a new, refined estimate for the pressure gives a substantial improvement of the interpolation bounds in Drivas et al. (2022) for slippery boundaries. A rich description of the scaling behaviour arises from our result: depending on the magnitude of the Prandtl number and slip-length, our upper bounds indicate five possible scaling laws: $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-1}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-\frac{2}{5}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{5}{13}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{4}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{1}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a hyperbolic relaxation of the viscous Cahn--Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions. In fact, we consider a relaxation term involving the second time derivative of the chemical potential in the first equation of the system. We develop a well-posedness, continuous dependence and regularity theory for the initial-boundary value problem. Moreover, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the system as the relaxation parameter tends to 0 and prove the convergence to the viscous Cahn--Hilliard system.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a systematic derivation of normal forms for dispersive equations using decorated trees introduced in arXiv:2005.01649. The key tool is the arborification map which is a morphism from the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra to the Shuffle Hopf algebra. It originates from Ecalle's approach to dynamical systems with singularities. This natural map has been used in many applications ranging from algebra, numerical analysis and rough paths. This connection shows that Hopf algebras also appear naturally in the context of dispersive equations and provide insights into some crucial decomposition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the logarithmically regularized 2D Euler equations, which are derived by regularizing the Euler equation for the vorticity have been studied recently to get better understanding of the Euler equations. It was shown that the local well-posedness in the critical Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)\cap H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ can be derived for $\gamma&gt;\dfrac{1}{2}$, and the strong ill-posedness in this borderline space was yielded by Kwon for $0\le\gamma\le\frac{1}{2}$. In this paper, we show that the local well-posedness of the logarithmically regularized 2D Euler equations can be achieved in the subcritical space $H^s(\mathbb{T}^2)$ with $s&gt;2$ for $\gamma \ge 0$. Moreover, we prove that the data-to-solution map is not uniformly continuous in the Sobolev $H^s(\mathbb{T}^2)$ topology for any $s&gt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an interpolation theorem for nonlinear functionals defined on scales of Banach spaces that generalize Besov spaces. It applies to functionals defined only locally, requiring only some weak Lipschitz conditions, extending those introduced by Lions and Peetre. Our analysis is self-contained and independent of any previous results about interpolation theory. It depends solely on the concepts of Friedrichs' mollifiers, seen through the formalism introduced by Hamilton, combined with the frequency envelopes introduced by Tao and used recently by two of the authors and others to study the Cauchy problem for various quasilinear evolutions in partial differential equations. Inspired by this latter work, our main application states that, for an abstract flow map of a quasilinear problem, both the continuity of the flow as a function of time and the continuity of the data to solution map follow automatically from the estimates that are usually proven when establishing the existence of solutions: propagation of regularity via tame a priori estimates for higher regularities and contraction for weaker norms.</description>

Abstract: We consider the lattice analog of a recently proposed continuum model for the propagation of one- and two-photon states in a random medium. We find that there is localization of single photons in an energy band centered at the resonant energy of the atoms. Moreover, there is also localization of photons at arbitrarily large energies. For the case of two photons, there is localization in an energy band centered at twice the resonant frequency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dimensions $d \in \{3,4,5,6,7\}$, we prove that the constant functions on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ maximize the weighted adjoint Fourier restriction inequality $$ \left| \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} |\widehat{f\sigma}(x)|^4\,\big(1 + g(x)\big)\,d x\right|^{1/4} \leq {\bf C} \, \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})}\,,$$ where $\sigma$ is the surface measure on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, for a suitable class of bounded perturbations $g:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{C}$. In such cases we also fully classify the complex-valued maximizers of the inequality. In the unperturbed setting ($g = {\bf 0}$), this was established by Foschi ($d=3$) and by the first and third authors ($d \in \{4,5,6,7\}$) in 2015. Our methods also yield a new sharp adjoint restriction inequality on $\mathbb S^7\subset \mathbb R^8$.</description>

      <title>Weak equals strong L2 regularity for partial tangential traces on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary trace operators that naturally correspond to $\mathrm{H}(\operatorname{curl},\Omega)$, namely the tangential and twisted tangential trace, where $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}$. In particular we regard partial tangential traces, i.e., we look only on a subset $\Gamma$ of the boundary $\partial\Omega$. We assume both $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$ to be strongly Lipschitz (possibly unbounded). We define the space of all $\mathrm{H}(\operatorname{curl},\Omega)$ fields that possess a $\mathrm{L}^{2}$ tangential trace in a weak sense and show that the set of all smooth fields is dense in that space, which is a generalization of Belgacem, Bernardi, Costabel and Dauge 1997. This is especially important for Maxwell's equation with mixed boundary condition as we answer the open problem by Weiss and Staffans 2013 (Section 5) for strongly Lipschitz pairs.</description>

      <title>Positive-density ground states of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation at positive density, that is, for a bounded solution not tending to 0 at infinity. We focus on infinite ground states, which are by definition minimizers of the energy under local perturbations. When the Fourier transform of the interaction potential takes negative values we prove the existence of a phase transition at high density, where the constant solution ceases to be a ground state. The analysis requires mixing techniques from elliptic PDE theory and statistical mechanics, in order to deal with a large class of interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametric Inference in McKean-Vlasov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonparametric statistical inference on a periodic interaction potential $W$ from noisy discrete space-time measurements of solutions $\rho=\rho_W$ of the nonlinear McKean-Vlasov equation, describing the probability density of the mean field limit of an interacting particle system. We show how Gaussian process priors assigned to $W$ give rise to posterior mean estimators that exhibit fast convergence rates for the implied estimated densities $\bar \rho$ towards $\rho_W$. We further show that if the initial condition $\phi$ is not too smooth and satisfies a standard deconvolvability condition, then one can consistently infer Sobolev-regular potentials $W$ at convergence rates $N^{-\theta}$ for appropriate $\theta&gt;0$, where $N$ is the number of measurements. The exponent $\theta$ can be taken to approach $1/2$ as the regularity of $W$ increases corresponding to `near-parametric' models.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Reconstruction Theorem on Rectangular Increments with an Application to a Mixed Hyperbolic SPDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the stochastic reconstruction theorem to a setting where the underlying family of distributions satisfies some natural conditions involving rectangular increments. This allows us to prove the well-posedness of a new class of mixed stochastic partial differential of hyperbolic type which combines standard Walsh stochastic integration and Young products.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating semilinear heat equations with gradient-dependent nonlinearities in $L^p$-sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that multilevel Picard approximations are capable of approximating solutions of semilinear heat equations in $L^{p}$-sense, ${p}\in [2,\infty)$, in the case of gradient-dependent, Lipschitz-continuous nonlinearities, in the sense that the computational effort of the multilevel Picard approximations grow at most polynomially in both the dimension $d$ and the reciprocal $1/\epsilon$ of the prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Symmetries for the gKPZ equation via multi-indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the two main symmetries for the one-dimensional generalised KPZ equation (gKPZ): the chain rule and the It\^o Isometry. We consider the equation in the full-subcritical regimes and use multi-indices that avoid an over-parametrization of the renormalised equation to compute the dimension of the two spaces associated with these two symmetries. Our proof is quite elementary and shows that multi-indices provide in this case a simplification in comparison to the results obtained via decorated trees. It also completes the program on the study of the chain rule initiated in arxiv:1902.02884 and continued in arxiv:2403.17066.</description>
