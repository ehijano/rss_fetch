      <title>Bridging the Gap between Collisional and Collisionless Plasma Shocks: A Simulation Study using OSIRIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock waves in plasmas can be characterized by the mechanisms behind their formation. When binary collisions are frequent, dissipation is collision-driven and the shock width is a few mean free paths. In contrast, collisionless shocks rely on collective plasma processes to establish dissipation on scales well below the mean free path. We bridge these regimes with particle-in-cell simulations using OSIRIS with a Coulomb-collision module, varying parameters that control collisionality. We find a smooth transition of the shock width in the intermediate region where the ion plasma parameter $N_D \approx 1$. Our results recover the asymptotic predictions: a collisional-regime width consistent with the Mott-Smith ansatz with a BGK operator, and the collisionless limit consistent with Tidman's classical formalism. The ion plasma parameter thus serves as a practical metric for identifying when shocks shift from fluid-like, mean-free-path scales to collisionless, sub-mean-free-path scales. We discuss implications for astrophysical environments, where shock breakout changes the shock width and marks the onset of efficient particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrabrilliant Positron Beam via Superponderomotive Injection in Laser Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-based acceleration of positrons attracts extensive interests due to the ultrahigh accelerating gradient and ultrashort duration, while generating wakefield positron beam by the inherent injection is still a great challenge. Here, we put forward a superponderomotive injection method of positrons in the blowout regime of laser wakefield acceleration. In this method, transverse laser fields facilitate the trapping of positrons into the laser-modulated longitudinal wakefield which dominates the subsequent energy gaining, that is distinct from the electrostatic induced superponderomotive electrons. Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this method can be implemented by the collision between a donut wake and a pair jet, resulting in the multi-cycle positron beam with hundreds of pC charge and brightness of $10^{13}~\rm{Am}^{-2}$. Such a collisional setup is available in the current laser-plasma experiments, and the generated positron beam is favorable for developing next generation of electron-positron collider, modeling the laboratory astrophysics and performing the ultrafast material diagnostics research.</description>

      <title>Pump with broadband probe experiments for single-shot measurements of plasma conditions and crossed-beam energy transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel technique for measuring plasma conditions using monochromatic pump-broadband probe laser interactions has been experimentally demonstrated. Originally proposed in [J. Ludwig et al., Phys. Plasmas \textbf{26}, 113108 (2019)], this method utilizes crossed-beam energy transfer between the broadband probe and the pump, mediated by plasma ion acoustic waves. The complete energy transfer spectrum can be captured in a single shot, enabling the inference of plasma parameters such as density, electron and ion temperatures, and flow velocity. Compared to Thomson scattering, this technique offers signal enhancements typically larger than 9 orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the required probe laser intensity and facilitating interactions that are linear and measurements that are non-perturbative of the plasma. Furthermore, it provides a powerful tool for advancing studies of crossed-beam energy transfer under conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws in Plasma Channels for Laser Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preformed plasma channels are essential for guiding high-power laser pulses over extended distances in laser wakefield accelerators, enabling the generation of multi-GeV electron beams for applications such as free-electron lasers and particle colliders. Above-threshold ionization heating provides a robust mechanism for creating laser-matched plasma channels across a wide parameter range, owing to its density- and geometry-independent heating effect. Establishing predictive scaling laws between channel parameters and formation conditions is critical for designing channels optimized for electron acceleration across energies spanning hundreds of MeV to tens of GeV. Through combined timescale analysis and numerical simulations, hydrodynamic expansion is identified as the dominant mechanism governing density profile evolution during ATI channel formation. Remarkably, this process maintains effective laser-guiding channel structures across a wide range of initial gas density, as evidenced by the persistent profile similarity observed despite these significant parameter variations. For parabolic channels matched to Gaussian laser drivers, rigorous scaling laws are established that, the on-axis density scales linearly with the initial gas density, while the matching radius has an exponential dependence on both the initial gas density and the ionization laser radius. These findings provide a systematic framework for the predictive design and optimization of plasma channels in high-efficiency and high-energy LWFA applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Solvers for Neutral Particle Dynamics in Plasma Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of turbulence in the boundary region of a tokamak is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of fusion reactors. In this work, the use of low-rank linear algebra techniques is shown to enhance the efficiency of boundary simulations, specifically by accelerating the solution of a kinetic model for the neutral particles. Solving the kinetic model deterministically using the method of characteristics requires the solution of integral equations, which typically result in dense linear systems upon discretization. We employ hierarchical matrix approximations to significantly reduce the computational cost of assembling and solving the linear systems, leading to substantial savings in both time and memory. The hierarchical matrix method is implemented and tested within the GBS simulation code for boundary simulations, achieving over 90\% reduction in computation time and memory, and enabling simulations with unprecedented spatial resolution for neutral particles.</description>

      <title>Polarized Emission of Intrabinary Shocks in Spider Pulsars from Global 3D Kinetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spider pulsar systems, a relativistic intrabinary shock forms when the pulsar wind collides with the massive outflow driven off the pulsar's low-mass stellar companion. The shock is a site of non-thermal particle acceleration, likely via shock-driven magnetic reconnection, and produces synchrotron emission. These shocks are among the few systems in which global scales can be reasonably captured with kinetic simulations, enabling first-principles particle acceleration and emission studies. We perform the first global 3D kinetic simulations of spider pulsar intrabinary shocks and predict their polarized emission properties. We report emission spectra, light curves, and polarization patterns as a function of the stripe-averaged magnetic field, cooling strength, and viewing inclination. At $90^\circ$ inclination and for a low stripe-averaged magnetic field, we reproduce the double peaked light curve observed in spider systems. We predict a significant polarization degree $\gtrsim15\%$, which monotonically increases with the stripe-averaged field strength. Our results can be applied to and tested by forthcoming X-ray polarization observations of spider pulsars.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Data-Driven Dynamics Model for Reinforcement Learning-based Control in HL-3 Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of reinforcement learning (RL)-based control in tokamaks, an emerging technique for controlled nuclear fusion with improved flexibility, typically requires substantial interaction with a simulator capable of accurately evolving the high-dimensional plasma state. Compared to first-principle-based simulators, whose intense computations lead to sluggish RL training, we devise an effective method to acquire a fully data-driven simulator, by mitigating the arising compounding error issue due to the underlying autoregressive nature. With high accuracy and appealing extrapolation capability, this high-fidelity dynamics model subsequently enables the rapid training of a qualified RL agent to directly generate engineering-reasonable actuator commands, aiming at the desired long-term targets of plasma configuration. Together with a surrogate model for Equilibrium Fitting code based on neural network, named EFITNN, the RL agent successfully maintains a 400-ms, 1 kHz trajectory control with accurate waveform tracking of plasma current and last closed flux surface on the HL-3 tokamak. Furthermore, it also demonstrates the feasibility of zero-shot adaptation to changed triangularity targets, confirming the robustness of the developed data-driven dynamics model. Our work underscores the advantage of fully data-driven dynamics models in yielding RL-based trajectory control policies at a sufficiently fast pace, an anticipated engineering requirement in daily discharge practices for the upcoming ITER device.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of sawteeth instability by short gas pulse injection in ADITYA-U tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments on ADITYA-U tokamak show a marked enhancement in the sawtooth period by application of short gas puffs of fuel that cause a modification of the radial density profile. A consequent suppression of the trapped electron modes (TEMs) then leads to an increase in the core electron temperature. This slows down the heat propagation following a sawtooth crash, causing a delay in achieving the critical temperature gradient inside the q = 1 surface required for the next sawtooth crash to happen. The overall scenario has strong similarities with the behavior of sawtooth under electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH). Our findings suggest an alternate, simpler technique for sawtooth control that may be usefully employed in small/medium-sized tokamaks that do not have an ECRH or any other auxiliary heating facility.</description>
