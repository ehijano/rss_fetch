      <title>Explosively driven Richtmyer--Meshkov instability jet suppression and enhancement via coupling machine learning and additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control the behavior of fluid instabilities at material interfaces, such as the shock-driven Richtmyer--Meshkov instability, is a grand technological challenge with a broad number of applications ranging from inertial confinement fusion experiments to explosively driven shaped charges. In this work, we use a linear-geometry shaped charge as a means of studying methods for controlling material jetting that results from the Richtmyer--Meshkov instability. A shaped charge produces a high-velocity jet by focusing the energy from the detonation of high explosives. The interaction of the resulting detonation wave with a hollowed cavity lined with a thin metal layer produces the unstable jetting effect. By modifying characteristics of the detonation wave prior to striking the lined cavity, the kinetic energy of the jet can be enhanced or reduced. Modifying the geometry of the liner material can also be used to alter jetting properties. We apply optimization methods to investigate several design parameterizations for both enhancing or suppressing the shaped-charge jet. This is accomplished using 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the design space that we consider. We also apply new additive manufacturing methods for producing the shaped-charge assemblies, which allow for experimental testing of complicated design geometries obtained through computational optimization. We present a direct comparison of our optimized designs with experimental results carried out at the High Explosives Application Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Collective nature of high-Q resonances in finite-size photonic metastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high quality-factor (high Q) resonances supported by periodic arrays of Mie resonators from the perspectives of both Bloch wave theory and multiple scattering theory. We reveal that, unlike a common belief, the bound states in the continuum (BICs) derived by the Bloch-wave theory do not directly determine the resonance with the highest Q value in large but finite arrays. Higher Q factors appear to be associated with collective resonances formed by nominally guided modes below the light line associated with strong effect of both electric and magnetic multipoles. Our findings offer valuable insights into accessing the modes with higher Q resonances via bonding modes within finite metastructures. Our results underpin the pivotal significance of magnetic and electric multipoles in the design of resonant metadevices and nonlocal flat-band optics. Moreover, our demonstrations reveal that coupled arrays of high-Q microcavities do not inherently result in a stronger light-matter interaction when compared to coupled low-Q nanoresonators. This result emphasizes the critical importance of the study of multiple light-scattering effects in cavity-based systems.</description>

      <title>An eco-friendly passivation strategy of resveratrol for highly efficient and antioxidative perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of perovskite solar cells is closely related to the defects in perovskite crystals, and there are a large number of crystal defects in the perovskite thin films prepared by the solution method, which is not conducive to the commercial production of PSCs. In this study, resveratrol(RES), a green natural antioxidant abundant in knotweed and grape leaves, was introduced into perovskite films to passivate the defect. RES achieves defect passivation by interacting with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite films. The results show that the quality of the perovskite film is significantly improved, and the energy level structure of the device is optimized, and the power conversion efficiency of the device is increased from 21.62% to 23.44%. In addition, RES can hinder the degradation of perovskite structures by O2- and CO2- free radicals, and the device retained 88% of its initial PCE after over 1000 hours in pure oxygen environment. The device retains 91% of the initial PCE after more than 1000 hours at 25{\deg}C and 50+5% relative humidity. This work provides a strategy for the use of natural and environmentally friendly additives to improve the efficiency and stability of devices, and provides an idea for the development of efficient, stable and environmentally friendly PSCs.</description>

      <title>A matter of performance &amp; criticality: a review of rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds for hydrogen liquefaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low efficiency of conventional liquefaction technologies based on the Joule-Thomson expansion makes liquid hydrogen currently not attractive enough for large-scale energy-related technologies that are important for the transition to a carbon-neutral society. Magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction has great potential to achieve higher efficiency and is therefore a crucial enabler for affordable liquid hydrogen. Cost-effective magnetocaloric materials with large magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes in the temperature range of 77 $\sim$ 20 K under commercially practicable magnetic fields are the foundation for the success of magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. Heavy rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds generally show excellent magnetocaloric performances, but the heavy rare-earth elements (Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) are highly critical in resources. Yttrium and light rare-earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) are relatively abundant, but their alloys generally show less excellent magnetocaloric properties. A dilemma appears: higher performance or lower criticality? In this review, we study how cryogenic temperature influences magnetocaloric performance by first reviewing heavy rare-earth-based intermetallic compounds. Next, we look at light rare-earth-based, "mixed" rare-earth-based, and Gd-based intermetallic compounds with the nature of the phase transition order taken into consideration, and summarize ways to resolve the dilemma.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Noise Quenching of An Integrated Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated frequency combs promise transformation of lab-based metrology into disruptive real-world applications. These microcombs are, however, sensitive to stochastic thermal fluctuations of the integrated cavity refractive index, with its impact becoming more significant as the cavity size becomes smaller. This tradeoff between microcomb noise performance and footprint stands as a prominent obstacle to realizing applications beyond a controlled lab environment. Here, we demonstrate that small footprint and low noise become compatible through the all-optical Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) method. Our study unveils that the phase-locking nature of the synchronization between the cavity soliton and the injected reference pump laser enables the microcomb to no longer be limited by internal noise sources. Instead, the microcomb noise is mostly limited by external sources, namely, the frequency noise of the two pumps that doubly pin the microcomb. First, we theoretically and experimentally show that the individual comb tooth linewidths of an octave-spanning microcomb remain within the same order-of-magnitude as the pump lasers, contrary to the single-pumped case that exhibits a more than two order-of-magnitude increase from the pump to the comb edge. Second, we theoretically show that intrinsic noise sources such as thermorefractive noise in KIS are quenched at the cavity decay rate, greatly decreasing its impact. Experimentally, we show that even with free-running lasers, the KIS microcomb can exhibit better repetition rate noise performance than the predicted thermorefractive noise limitation in absence of KIS.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyzes of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to the axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyzes without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a formation of an axisymmetric spike singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire pinch-off and separation into a disjoint segments. The scaling analysis of the amplitude spike singularity is performed, and the time-and-electric field-dependent dimensions of the spike are characterized. A weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time-and-electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Circuits I: Association of devices in stationary nonequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a circuit made of thermodynamic devices in stationary nonequilibrium, we determine the mean currents (of energy, matter, charge, etc) exchanged with external reservoirs driving the circuit out of equilibrium. Starting from the conductance matrix describing the nonlinear current--force characteristics of each device, we obtain the conductance matrix of the composite device. This generalizes the rule of resistance addition (serial association) or conductance addition (parallel association) in stationary out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics and for multiple coupled potentials and currents of different natures. Our work emphasizes the pivotal role of conservation laws when creating circuits of complex devices. Finally, two examples illustrate the determination of the conservation laws for the serial and parallel associations of thermodynamic devices.</description>

      <title>AlGaN/AlN heterostructures: an emerging platform for nonlinear integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving area of integrated photonics, there is a growing need for materials that satisfy the particular requirements of increasingly complex and specialized devices and applications. Present photonic material platforms have made significant progress over the past years; however, each platform still faces specific material and performance challenges. We introduce a novel material for integrated photonics: Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN) on Aluminum Nitride (AlN) as a platform for developing reconfigurable and nonlinear on-chip optical systems. AlGaN combines compatibility with standard semiconductor fabrication technologies, high electro-optic modulation capabilities, and large nonlinear coefficients while providing a broad and low-loss spectral transmission range, making it a viable material for advanced photonic applications. In this work, we design and grow AlGaN/AlN heterostructures and integrate fundamental photonic building blocks into these chips. In particular, we fabricate edge couplers, low-loss waveguides, directional couplers, and tunable high-quality factor ring resonators to enable nonlinear light-matter interaction and quantum functionality. The comprehensive platform we present in this work paves the way for nonlinear photon-pair generation applications, on-chip nonlinear quantum frequency conversion, and fast electro-optic modulation for switching and routing classical and quantum light fields.</description>

      <title>Room temperature realization of artificial chiral magnets with reprogrammable magnon nonreciprocity at zero field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnets are materials which possess unique helical arrangements of magnetic moments, which give rise to nonreciprocal transport and fascinating physics phenomena. On the one hand, their exploration is guided by the prospects of unconventional signal processing, computation schemes and magnetic memory. On the other hand, progress in applications is hindered by the challenging materials synthesis, limited scalability and typically low critical temperature. Here, we report the creation and exploration of artificial chiral magnets (ACMs) at room temperature. By employing a mass production compatible deposition technology, we synthesize ACMs, which consist of helical Ni surfaces on central cylinders. Using optical microscopy, we reveal nonreciprocal magnon transport at GHz frequencies. It is controlled by programmable toroidal moments which result from the ACM's geometrical handedness and field-dependent spin chirality. We present materials-by-design rules which optimize the helically curved ferromagnets for 3D nonreciprocal transport at room temperature and zero magnetic field.</description>
