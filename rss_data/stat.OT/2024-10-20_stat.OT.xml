      <title>Probabilistic inference when the population space is open</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In using observed data to make inferences about a population quantity, it is commonly assumed that the sampling distribution from which the data were drawn belongs to a given parametric family of distributions, or at least, a given finite set of such families, i.e. the population space is assumed to be closed. Here, we address the problem of how to determine an appropriate post-data distribution for a given population quantity when such an assumption about the underlying sampling distribution is not made, i.e. when the population space is open. The strategy used to address this problem is based on the fact that even though, due to an open population space being non-measurable, we are not able to place a post-data distribution over all the sampling distributions contained in such a population space, it is possible to partition this type of space into a finite, countable or uncountable number of subsets such that a distribution can be placed over a variable that simply indicates which of these subsets contains the true sampling distribution. Moreover, it is argued that, by using sampling distributions that belong to a number of parametric families, it is possible to adequately and elegantly represent the sampling distributions that belong to each of the subsets of such a partition. Since a statistical model is conceived as being a model of a population space rather than a model of a sampling distribution, it is also argued that neither the type of models that are put forward nor the expression of pre-data knowledge via such models can be directly brought into question by the data. Finally, the case is made that, as well as not being required in the modelling process that is proposed, the standard practice of using P values to measure the absolute compatibility of an individual or family of sampling distributions with observed data is neither meaningful nor useful.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Boxplots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the potential of differentially private data visualization to harmonize data analysis and privacy, research in this area remains relatively underdeveloped. Boxplots are a widely popular visualization used for summarizing a dataset and for comparison of multiple datasets. Consequentially, we introduce a differentially private boxplot. We evaluate its effectiveness for displaying location, scale, skewness and tails of a given empirical distribution. In our theoretical exposition, we show that the location and scale of the boxplot are estimated with optimal sample complexity, and the skewness and tails are estimated consistently. In simulations, we show that this boxplot performs similarly to a non-private boxplot, and it outperforms a boxplot naively constructed from existing differentially private quantile algorithms. Additionally, we conduct a real data analysis of Airbnb listings, which shows that comparable analysis can be achieved through differentially private boxplot visualization.</description>
