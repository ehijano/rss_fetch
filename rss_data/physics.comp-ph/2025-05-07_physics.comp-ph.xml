      <title>ACCES: Non-Invasive Simulation Calibration via Optimisation using Evolutionary Algorithms and Metaprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration is a vital step in the development of rigorous digital models of diverse physical and chemical processes, yet one which is highly time- and labour-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel tool, Autonomous Calibration and Characterisation via Evolutionary Simulation (ACCES), which uses evolutionary optimisation to efficiently, autonomously determine the calibration parameters of a numerical simulation using only simple experimental measurements. Modelling calibration as an optimisation problem, it can use any combination of sensibly-chosen experimental measurements as calibration targets for virtually any numerical modelling technique, e.g. computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element analysis (FEA), discrete element method (DEM). We provide a case study demonstrating the application of the method to DEM modelling and comprehensively validate the calibrated DEM particle properties using positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) experiments in conjunction with DEM digital models of systems spanning orders-of-magnitude differences in scale and covering both collisional and frictional operating regimes, showing excellent agreement. Key results show that i) even simple, well-chosen targets can achieve highly-accurate calibration, ii) though the calibration process only used images corresponding exclusively to a free-flowing surface shape, it was able to reproduce completely different quantities as well, such as velocities and occupancies, with quantitative precision, and thus iii) DEM can quantitatively predict complex particulate dynamics even outside the calibration system. ACCES is a portable, tested, documented and officially-registered Python package available under the GNU General Public License v3.0.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Method for Modeling Creep-Fatigue Stress-Strain Behavior Using Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a data-driven machine learning approach for modeling one-dimensional stress-strain behavior under cyclic loading, utilizing experimental data from the nickel-based Alloy 617. The study employs uniaxial creep-fatigue test data acquired under various loading histories and compares two distinct neural network-based ODE models. The first model, known as the black-box model, comprehensively describes the strain-stress relationship using a Neural ODE equation. To interpret this black-box model, we apply the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) technique, transforming the black-box model into an equation-based model using symbolic regression. The second model, the Neural flow rule model, incorporates Hooke's Law for the linear elastic component, with the nonlinear part characterized by a Neural ODE. Both models are trained with experimental data to accurately reflect the observed stress-strain behavior. We conduct a detailed comparison with the standard Chaboche model, which includes three back stresses. Our results demonstrate that the neural network-based ODE models precisely capture the experimental creep-fatigue mechanical behavior, exceeding the standard Chaboche model's accuracy. Furthermore, an interpretable model derived from the black-box neural ODE model through symbolic regression achieves accuracy comparable to the Chaboche model, enhancing its interpretability. The results highlight the potential of neural network-based ODE models to depict complex creep-fatigue behavior, eliminating the necessity for experts to define a specific, material-focused model form.</description>

      <title>Dilatation-driven spurious dissipation in weakly compressible methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weakly compressible methods to simulate incompressible flows are in a state of rapid development, owing to the envisaged efficiency they offer for parallel computing. The pressure waves in such methods travel at finite speeds, and hence they yield non-solenoidal velocity fields. This inherent inability to satisfy mass conservation corresponding to incompressible flows is a crucial concern for weakly compressible methods. Another widely reported observation is the progressive enhancement of non-physical dissipation with the increase in the artificial compressibility parameter. By scrutinizing the dilatation terms appearing in the kinetic energy equation, we provide vital insights into the influence of mass conservation error on the accuracy of these methods, and explain the mechanism behind the dissipative nature of the compressibility. Analysing transient laminar and turbulent flows, we show that the dilatation-driven dissipation terms, not the mass conservation error alone, govern the accuracy of weakly compressible methods. The insights provided in this work are not only of fundamental importance but will be of considerable value in aiding the development of weakly compressible methods that can allow a larger artificial Mach number, thus alleviating the stringent time step restriction in such methods.</description>

      <title>GrAviPaSt's Lens to the Past: Unveiling the Evolution of Filamentary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1, 0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple and efficient filament identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.</description>

      <title>XDiag: Exact Diagonalization for quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Local Optimization in Complex Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller, "local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of "local hardness", i.e., complexity from the local solver perspective, in determining the ground states of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors stem from global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the more computationally intensive global minimization. These findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical trap loading with an effusive oven in a large optical access experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental, numerical, and analytical study of a strontium magneto-optical trap (MOT) loaded from an effusive oven in a configuration optimized for high numerical aperture optical tweezers. Our approach orients the cold atom flux along the MOT symmetry axis to reduce the experimental complexity and maximize the overall optical access into the scientific region of study. We use a moving molasses technique to enable this configuration and show that its performance depends critically on metastable-state shelving (to 5s5p 3P2) during the atom transfer to the 3D MOT. Furthermore, we find that the parameters for optimal transfer efficiency are bounded by dark-state loss (to 5s5p 3P0) in the trap region where repumping is present. These observations are verified to great degree of accuracy using both our developed analytical and numerical models. The corresponding 3D simulation tool is used to perform a comprehensive study of the trap loading dynamics, beginning at the oven exit and ending at the 3D MOT, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing an effusive oven experiment.</description>

      <title>Fabrication-Directed Entanglement for Designing Chiral and Anisotropic Metamaterial Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled networks are fundamental in various systems, from biological structures to engineered materials. Current techniques for programming entanglement often rely on intricate chemistry or result in statistically homogeneous networks, limiting the ability to create spatially patterned structures with precisely engineered functions. Thus, a key challenge remains in developing approaches to program complex mechanical behaviors, such as anisotropy and chirality, within monolithic entangled structures. This work introduces Fabrication-Directed Entanglement (FDE), a methodology integrating viscous thread printing (VTP) and topology optimization (TO) to program the entanglement of a single homogeneous filament. By spatially adjusting VTP parameters (deposition height, speed), we control local coiling density, creating quasi-two-phase (dense/sparse) regions within a monolithic entangled foam. Topology optimization guides the placement of these regions to achieve target macroscopic mechanical properties. Here we show foam-like mechanical metamaterials with tunable compliance, rigidity, and chirality. Experimental testing and simulation confirm that FDE expands the achievable material property space compared to homogeneous VTP foams, enabling properties like tunable directional stiffness, Poisson's ratios from $\nu\approx0.06~\text{to}~0.56$, and novel significant normal-shear coupling ($\eta_{212}\approx0.72$) from a single base material. This approach offers a viable new pathway for designing complex, functional entangled foam structures with tailored mechanical behaviors.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of atomic correlated disordering in photoinduced VO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that atomic disordering dynamics are more universal than conventional coherent processes in photoinduced phase transitions (PIPTs), yet its mechanism remains unclear. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), we find that, at lower photoexcitation, higher lattice temperature accelerates atomic disordering, which thereby lowers the threshold for phase transition, by thermally exciting more phonons to randomize the lattice vibrations in VO$_2$. Above this threshold, however, we observe that the transition timescale and atomic disordering become temperature-independent since thermally excited lattice vibrations induce a similar evolution of photoexcited holes. Additionally, we show that photoexcitation initially elongates the V-V dimers followed by a rotation with tangential displacements (along the z-axis) mediated by O atoms, resulting in strongly correlated motion along the z-axis. Consequently, atomic disordering is more dominant along the x direction, attributed to the relatively unrestricted motion of V-V dimers along this direction. The motion of V atoms along the z-axis is more constrained, leading to less disorder along the z-axis, which results in a "correlated disorder" phenomenon. This anisotropic disordering in VO$_2$ offers new insights into PIPTs mechanisms, guiding future studies on photoinduced disordered transitions.</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis of Interface-Driven Spin-Orbit Coupling in Molecular Adsorbates on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) lifts molecular orbital degeneracy, enabling bi-level electronic platforms suitable for next-generation digital devices. However, common light-atom molecular feedstocks exhibit weak SOC due to the absence of heavy elements. To enhance SOC without synthesizing new materials, we leverage interfacial interactions between molecules and transition-element-based solid-state materials. This computational study investigates SOC splitting in metal-phthalocyanine adsorbed on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) using density functional theory (DFT). The enhanced SOC splitting is attributed to strong orbital hybridization at the molecule-substrate interface. Specifically, Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPC) on monolayer MoS2 achieves a notable SOC splitting of ~8 meV. Furthermore, when ZnPC forms self-assembled chains on MoS2, the splitting increases to ~20 meV, driven by the formation of hybrid bands modulated by molecular periodicity. These findings highlight the role of interfacial and intermolecular interactions in inducing and enhancing SOC in surface-adsorbed molecules, providing a new strategy for molecular spintronic materials without complex synthetic efforts.</description>

      <title>Deep learning spinfoam vertex amplitudes: the Euclidean Barrett-Crane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spinfoam theories propose a well-defined path-integral formulation for quantum gravity and are hoped to provide the dynamics of loop quantum gravity. However, it is computationally hard to calculate spinfoam amplitudes. The well-studied Euclidean Barrett-Crane model provides an excellent setting for testing analytical and numerical tools to probe spinfoam models. We explore a data-driven approach to accelerating spinfoam computations by showing that the vertex amplitude is an object that can be learned from data using deep learning. We divide the learning process into a classification and a regression task: Two networks are independently engineered to decide whether the amplitude is zero or not and to predict the precise numerical value, respectively. The trained networks are tested with several accuracy measures. The classifier in particular demonstrates robust generalisation far outside the training domain, while the regressor demonstrates high predictive accuracy in the domain it is trained on. We discuss limitations, possible improvements, and implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Janus bound states in the continuum in structurally symmetric photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a sigma_z-symmetry-preserving approach to achieve Janus bound states in the continuum (Janus BICs) exhibiting asymmetric topological charges in the upward and downward radiation channels. While prior approaches typically involve explicit structural perturbations to break vertical symmetry, our design leverages a bilayer photonic crystal slab (PCS) system with independently tunable refractive indices, introducing an optical asymmetry without altering the geometric symmetry. In the optical symmetry case, the system supports symmetry-protected BICs at Gamma point with topological charge q = -1, and Friedrich-Wintgen BICs (FW-BICs) at off-Gamma point with q = +1. Upon introducing refractive index detuning, the polarization vortex splits into two circularly polarized states (C points) with half-integer topological charge (q = 1/2), shifting oppositely in momentum space for upward and downward radiation, while the symmetry-protected BICs remain unaffected. Janus BICs are established through the shift of upward-radiating C points shift towards the Gamma point, accumulating a total topological charge of q = -1, while the downward-radiating counterpart contributes q = +1, leading to a net topological charge reversal between the two radiation channels. This purely optical mechanism allows for the realization of Janus BICs without any structural deformation. Their asymmetric topological nature makes them ideally suited for applications in unidirectional light sources, chiral photonic interfaces, and topological photonic circuits, offering a promising platform for on-chip optical communication, sensing, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Electromagnetic and Nanophotonic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) with physics-guided frameworks has opened transformative avenues for advancing the design and optimization of electromagnetic and nanophotonic systems. Innovations in deep neural networks (DNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) now provide robust tools to tackle longstanding challenges in light scattering engineering, meta-optics, and nonlinear photonics. This review outlines recent progress in leveraging these computational methodologies to enhance device performance across domains such as dynamic light modulation, antenna design, and nonlinear optical phenomena. We systematically survey advancements in AI-driven forward and inverse design strategies, which bypass conventional trial-and-error approaches by embedding physical laws directly into optimization workflows. Furthermore, the integration of AI accelerates electromagnetic simulations and enables precise modelling of complex optical effects, including topological photonic states and nonlinear interactions. A comparative evaluation of algorithmic frameworks highlights their strengths in balancing computational efficiency, multi-objective optimization, and fabrication feasibility. Challenges such as limited interpretability of AI models and data scarcity for unconventional optical modes are critically addressed. Finally, we emphasize future opportunities in scalable multi-physics modelling, adaptive architectures, and practical deployment of AI-optimized photonic devices. This work underscores the pivotal role of AI in transcending traditional design limitations, thereby propelling the development of next-generation photonic technologies with unprecedented functionality and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Outstanding advances in solid-state laser technology, employing the optical parametric chirped-pulse-amplification (OPCPA) technique, have led physicists to focus laser pulses to highly-relativistic intensities which led to novel schemes for charged-particle acceleration and radiation generation in laser-driven plasmas. Microscopic understanding of these highly nonlinear processes is possible via accurate modeling of the laser-plasma interaction using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Numerous codes are available and they rely on finite difference time domain methods on Yee-grids or on the analytical solution of the Maxwell-equations in spectral space. In this work, we present a solution bridging these two methods, which we call finite difference exponential time domain solution. This method could provide a very high accuracy even in 3D, but with improved locality, similar to the pseudospectral analytical methods without relying on transformation to special basis functions. We verified the accuracy and the convergence of the method in various benchmarks, including laser propagation in vacuum and in underdense plasma. We also simulated electron injection in a non-linear laser-plasma wakefield acceleration and surface high-harmonic generation in the overdense regime. The results are then compared with those obtained from standard PIC codes.</description>

      <title>Mitigating mode collapse in normalizing flows by annealing with an adaptive schedule: Application to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalizing flows (NFs) provide uncorrelated samples from complex distributions, making them an appealing tool for parameter estimation. However, the practical utility of NFs remains limited by their tendency to collapse to a single mode of a multimodal distribution. In this study, we show that annealing with an adaptive schedule based on the effective sample size (ESS) can mitigate mode collapse. We demonstrate that our approach can converge the marginal likelihood for a biochemical oscillator model fit to time-series data in ten-fold less computation time than a widely used ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We show that the ESS can also be used to reduce variance by pruning the samples. We expect these developments to be of general use for sampling with NFs and discuss potential opportunities for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Weighted balanced truncation method for approximating kernel functions by exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel approximation with exponentials is useful in many problems with convolution quadrature and particle interactions such as integral-differential equations, molecular dynamics and machine learning. This paper proposes a weighted balanced truncation to construct an optimal model reduction method for compressing the number of exponentials in the sum-of-exponentials approximation of kernel functions. This method shows great promise in approximating long-range kernels, achieving over 4 digits of accuracy improvement for the Ewald-splitting and inverse power kernels in comparison with the classical balanced truncation. Numerical results demonstrate its excellent performance and attractive features for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Modeling of Surface Diffusion Coupled with Large Deformation in 3D Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and computational model that explores the behavior of a thin hydrated film bonded to a non-hydrated / impermeable soft substrate in the context of surface and bulk elasticity coupled with surface diffusion kinetics. This type of coupling can manifests as an integral aspect in diverse engineering processes encountered in optical interference coatings, tissue engineering, soft electronics, and can prove important in design process for the next generation of sensors and actuators, especially as the focus is shifted to systems in smaller lengthscales. The intricate interplay between solvent diffusion and deformation of the film is governed by surface poroelasticity, and the viscoelastic deformation of the substrate. While existing methodologies offer tools for studying coupled poroelasticity involving solvent diffusion and network deformation, there exists a gap in understanding how coupled poroelastic processes occurring in a film attached to the boundary of a highly deformable solid can influence its response. In this study, we introduce a non-equilibrium thermodynamics formulation encompassing the multiphysical processes of surface poroelasticity and bulk viscoelasticity, complemented by a corresponding finite element implementation. Our approach captures the complex dynamics between the finite deformation of the substrate and solvent diffusion on the surface. This work contributes valuable insights, particularly in scenarios where the coupling of surface diffusion kinetics and substrate elasticity is an important design factor.</description>

      <title>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</description>

      <title>High-order Adaptive Rank Integrators for Multi-scale Linear Kinetic Transport Equations in the Hierarchical Tucker Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new adaptive rank approximation technique for computing solutions to the high-dimensional linear kinetic transport equation. The approach we propose is based on a macro-micro decomposition of the kinetic model in which the angular domain is discretized with a tensor product quadrature rule under the discrete ordinates method. To address the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed low-rank method is cast in the framework of the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. The adaptive rank integrators we propose are built upon high-order discretizations for both time and space. In particular, this work considers implicit-explicit discretizations for time and finite-difference weighted-essentially non-oscillatory discretizations for space. The high-order singular value decomposition is used to perform low-rank truncation of the high-dimensional time-dependent distribution function. The methods are applied to several benchmark problems, where we compare the solution quality and measure compression achieved by the adaptive rank methods against their corresponding full-grid methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of high-order discretizations in the proposed low-rank framework.</description>

      <title>Neural network distillation of orbital dependent density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) offers a desirable balance between quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency in practical many-electron calculations. Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy functional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging from strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital-dependent expressions with many tuned parameters. In this paper, we formulate a general way of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a way that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as higher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling access to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are achieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models capable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly enforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called global density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing DFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of molecular structures and popular meta-generalized gradient approximation density functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies coming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of transferability to a variety of physical systems. The presented framework is general and could be extended to more complex orbital and energy dependent functionals as well as refined with specialized datasets.</description>

      <title>In-poor IGZO: superior resilience to hydrogen in forming gas anneal and PBTI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) channel transistors in silicon-based ecosystems requires the resilience of the channel material to hydrogen treatment. Standard IGZO, containing 40% In (metal ratio) suffers from degradation under forming gas anneal (FGA) and hydrogen (H) driven positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). We demonstrate scaled top-gated ALD transistors with an In-poor (In $\le$ 17%) IGZO channel that show superior resilience to hydrogen compared to the In-rich (In=40%) counterpart. The devices, fabricated with a 300-mm FAB process with dimensions down to $W_\mathrm{CH} \times L_\mathrm{TG} = 80 \times 40 \mathrm{nm}^2$, show excellent stability in 2-hour 420$^\circ$C forming gas anneal ($0.06 \le \left| \Delta V_{\mathrm{TH}} \right| \le 0.33\mathrm{V}$) and improved resilience to H in PBTI at 125$^\circ$C (down to no detectable H-induced $V_{\mathrm{TH}}$ shift) compared to In-rich devices. We demonstrate that the device degradation by H in the FGA is different from the H-induced VTH instability in PBTI, namely oxygen scavenging by H and H release from a gate-dielectric into the channel, respectively, and that resilience to H in one process does not automatically translate to resilience to H in the other one. This significant improvement in IGZO resilience to H enables the use of FGA treatments during fabrication needed for silicon technology compatibility, as well as further scaling and 3D integration, bringing IGZO-based technologies closer to mass production.</description>

      <title>CK-MPM: A Compact-Kernel Material Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Material Point Method (MPM) has become a cornerstone of physics-based simulation, widely used in geomechanics and computer graphics for modeling phenomena such as granular flows, viscoelasticity, fracture mechanics, etc. Despite its versatility, the original MPM suffers from cell-crossing instabilities caused by discontinuities in particle-grid transfer kernels. Existing solutions mostly mitigate these issues by adopting smoother shape functions, but at the cost of increased numerical diffusion and computational overhead due to larger kernel support. In this paper, we propose a novel C^2-continuous compact kernel for MPM that achieves a unique balance in terms of stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Our method integrates seamlessly with Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) MPM, while only doubling the number of grid nodes associated with each particle compared to linear kernels. At its core is an innovative dual-grid framework, which associates particles with grid nodes exclusively within the cells they occupy on two staggered grids, ensuring consistent and stable force computations. We demonstrate that our method can be conveniently implemented using a domain-specific language, Taichi, or based on open-source GPU MPM frameworks, achieving faster runtime and less numerical diffusion compared to quadratic B-spline MPM. Comprehensive validation through unit tests, comparative studies, and stress tests demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in conserving both linear and angular momentum, handling stiff materials, and scaling efficiently for large-scale simulations. Our results highlight the transformative potential of compact, high-order kernels in advancing MPM's capabilities for stable, accurate, and high-performance simulations.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite their potential, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, using first-principles calculations. CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, enabling the manipulation of the N\'eel vector in CrSb films through a suitable ferromagnetic substrate. The anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution. Our results demonstrate that CrSb provides a good platform for investigating the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Computation of Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibria with Voigt Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first numerical investigation of using Voigt regularization as a method for obtaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria without the assumption of nested magnetic flux surfaces. Voigt regularization modifies the MHD dynamics by introducing additional terms that vanish in the infinite-time limit, allowing for magnetic reconnection and the formation of magnetic islands, which can overlap and produce field-line chaos. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through numerical solutions of two-dimensional ideal and resistive test problems. Our results show that Voigt regularization can significantly accelerate the convergence to solutions in resistive MHD problems, while also highlighting challenges in applying the method to ideal MHD systems. This research opens up new possibilities for developing more efficient and robust MHD equilibrium solvers, which could contribute to the design and optimization of future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>
