      <title>A Novel Technique for Long-term Timing of Redback Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present timing solutions spanning nearly two decades for five redback (RB) systems found in globular clusters (GC), created using a novel technique that effectively "isolates" the pulsar. By accurately measuring the time of passage through periastron ($T_0$) at points over the timing baseline, we use a piecewise-continuous, binary model to get local solutions of the orbital variations that we pair with long-term orbital information to remove the orbital timing delays. The isolated pulse times of arrival can then be fit to describe the spin behavior of the millisecond pulsar (MSP). The results of our timing analyses via this method are consistent with those of conventional timing methods for binaries in GCs as demonstrated by analyses of NGC 6440D. We also investigate the observed orbital phase variations for these systems. Quasi-periodic oscillations in Terzan 5P's orbit may be the result of changes to the gravitational-quadruple moment of the companion as prescribed by the Applegate model. We find a striking correlation between the standard deviation of the phase variations as a fraction of a system's orbit ($\sigma_{\Delta T_0}$) and the MSP's spin frequency, as well as a potential correlation between $\sigma_{\Delta T_0}$ and the binary's projected semi-major axis. While long-term RB timing is fraught with large systematics, our work provides a needed alternative for studying systems with significant orbital variations, especially when high-cadence monitoring observations are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Resolved and unresolved Galactic gamma-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic gamma-ray flux can be described as the sum of two components: the first is due to the emission from an ensemble of discrete sources, and the second is formed by the photons produced by cosmic rays propagating in interstellar space and interacting with gas or radiation fields. The source component is partially resolved as the contributions from individual sources, but a fraction is unresolved and appears as a diffuse flux. Both the unresolved source flux and the interstellar emission flux encode information of great significance for high energy astrophysics, and therefore the separation of these two contributions is very important. In this work we use the distributions in celestial coordinates of the objects contained in the catalogs obtained by the Extensive Air Showers telescopes HAWC and LHAASO to estimate the total luminosity of the Galactic gamma--ray sources and the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse gamma--ray flux. This analysis suggests that while the flux from unresolved sources is measurable and important, the dominant contribution to the diffuse flux over most of the celestial sphere is interstellar emission.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Properties of Type Ibn/Icn Supernovae and Their Progenitor Channels through X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ibn/Icn supernovae (SNe Ibn/Icn), which are characterized by narrow helium or carbon lines originated in hydrogen-poor dense circumstellar medium (CSM), provide new insights into the final evolution of massive stars. While SNe Ibn/Icn are expected to emit strong X-rays through the strong SN-CSM interaction, the X-ray emission modeling effort has been limited so far. In the present study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe Ibn/Icn. We find that the soft X-ray LC provides information about the CSM compositions, while the hard X-ray LC is a robust measure of the CSM density, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. In addition, considering the evolution of the ionization state in the unshocked CSM, a bright soft X-ray is expected in the first few days since the explosion, which encourages rapid X-ray follow-up observations as a tool to study the nature of SNe Ibn/Icn. Applying our model to the soft X-ray LCs of SNe Ibn 2006jc and 2022ablq, we derive that the CSM potentially contains a larger fraction of carbon and oxygen for SN 2006jc than 2022ablq, highlighting the power of the soft X-ray modeling to address the nature of the CSM. We also discuss detectability and observational strategy, with which the currently operating telescopes such as NuSTAR and Swift can offer an irreplaceable opportunity to explore the nature of these enigmatic rapid transients and their still-unclarified progenitor channel(s).</description>

      <title>Probing the low-energy particle content of blazar jets through MeV observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the blazars observed by Fermi actually have the peak of their time-averaged gamma-ray emission outside the $\sim$ GeV Fermi energy range, at $\sim$ MeV energies. The detailed shape of the emission spectrum around the $\sim$ MeV peak places important constraints on acceleration and radiation mechanisms in the blazar jet and may not be the simple broken power law obtained by extrapolating from the observed X-ray and GeV gamma-ray spectra. In particular, state-of-the-art simulations of particle acceleration by shocks show that a significant fraction (possibly up to $\approx 90\%$) of the available energy may go into bulk, quasi-thermal heating of the plasma crossing the shock rather than producing a non-thermal power law tail. Other ``gentler" but possibly more pervasive acceleration mechanisms such as shear acceleration at the jet boundary may result in a further build-up of the low-energy ($\gamma \lesssim 10^{2}$) electron/positron population in the jet. As already discussed for the case of gamma-ray bursts, the presence of a low-energy, Maxwellian-like ``bump'' in the jet particle energy distribution can strongly affect the spectrum of the emitted radiation, e.g., producing an excess over the emission expected from a power-law extrapolation of a blazar's GeV-TeV spectrum. We explore the potential detectability of the spectral component ascribable to a hot, quasi-thermal population of electrons in the high-energy emission of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ). We show that for typical FSRQ physical parameters, the expected spectral signature is located at $\sim$ MeV energies. For the brightest Fermi FSRQ sources, the presence of such a component will be constrained by the upcoming MeV Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) satellite.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Roche Lobe Overflow in the Formation of Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new methodology to model Roche lobe overflow (RLO) systems to unprecedented resolution simultaneously across the envelope, donor wind, tidal stream, and accretion disk regimes without reliance upon previously-universal symmetry, mass flux, and angular momentum flux assumptions. We have applied this method to the semidetached high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) M33 X-7 in order to provide a direct comparison to recent observations of an RLO candidate system at two overflow states of overfilling factors f = 1.01 and f = 1.1. We found extreme overflow ( f = 1.1) to exhibit entirely conservative unstable mass transfer (MT), with tidal stream density and deflected angle comparable to predictions. The f = 1.01 case differed in stream geometry, accretion disk size, and efficiency, demonstrating non-conservative stable MT through a ballistic uniform-width stream. The non-conservative and stable nature of the f = 1.01 case MT also suggests that existing assumptions of semi-detached binaries undergoing RLO may mischaracterize the parameter space of stability for the L1 flow. We also conducted a piecewise evolution of M33 X-7 across nearly the entirety of RLO phase from onset to runaway unstable MT. We present the first model of the efficiency of MT and its associated angular momentum across overfilling factor parameter space. We also present novel relations for binary separation, mass ratio, L1 mass transfer rate, and Roche timescale as they vary with respect to the overfilling factor. These provide constraints on the threshold for the onset of unstable MT which ultimately led in our system to exponentially faster MT evolution. Collectively these parameter constraints, relations, and explorations probe RLO dynamics in HMXBs and their role and distribution as progenitors of binary black holes and common envelopes.</description>

      <title>Evolution, speed, and precession of the parsec-scale jet in the 3C 84 radio galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high resolution images of the radio source 3C 84 at 43 GHz, from 121 observations conducted by the BEAM-ME monitoring program between 2010 and 2023. Imaging was performed using the recent forward modeling imaging method eht-imaging, which achieved a resolution of 80 $\mu$as, a factor of $\sim$2-3 better than traditional imaging methods such as CLEAN. The sequence of images depicts the growth and expansion of the parsec-scale relativistic jet in 3C 84, clearly resolving a complex internal structure, showing bending in the jet, and changes in its launching direction and expansion speed. We report measurements of the expansion speed in time, which show that the jet undergoes three regimes, marked by the beginning and ending of a hot spot frustration phase. The images' high resolution allows us also to measure the projected launching direction as a function of time, finding an irregular variation pattern. Our results confirm previous studies of the morphological transition underwent by 3C 84 and provide quantitative measurements of the jet's kinematic properties over a decade time-scale.</description>

      <title>Long term optical variations in Swift J1858.6-0814: evidence for ablation and comparisons to radio properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical monitoring of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1858.6-0814 during its 2018-2020 outburst and subsequent quiescence. We find that there was strong optical variability present throughout the entire outburst period covered by our monitoring, while the average flux remained steady. The optical spectral energy distribution is blue on most dates, consistent with emission from an accretion disc, interspersed by occasional red flares, likely due to optically thin synchrotron emission. We find that the fractional rms variability has comparable amplitudes in the radio and optical bands. This implies that the long-term variability is likely to be due to accretion changes, seen at optical wavelengths, that propagate into the jet, seen at radio frequencies. We find that the optical flux varies asymmetrically about the orbital period peaking at phase ~0.7, with a modulation amplitude that is the same across all optical wavebands suggesting that reprocessing off of the disc, companion star and ablated material is driving the phase dependence. The evidence of ablation found in X-ray binaries is vital in understanding the long term evolution of neutron star X-ray binaries and how they evolve into (potentially isolated) millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>Insights from Modeling Magnetar-driven Light Curves of Stripped-envelope Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the semi-analytical light curve modelling results of 11 stripped-envelope SNe (SESNe), where millisecond magnetars potentially drive their light curves. The light-curve modelling is performed utilizing the $\chi^2$-minimisation code $\texttt{MINIM}$ considering millisecond magnetar as a central engine powering source. The magnetar model well regenerates the bolometric light curves of all the SESNe in the sample and constrains numerous physical parameters, including magnetar's initial spin period ($P_\textrm{i}$) and magnetic field ($B$), explosion energy of supernova ($E_\textrm{exp}$), progenitor radius ($R_\textrm{p}$), etc. Within the sample, the superluminous SNe 2010kd and 2020ank exhibit the lowest $B$ and $P_\textrm{i}$ values, while the relativistic Ic broad-line SN 2012ap shows the highest values for both parameters. The explosion energy for all SESNe in the sample (except SN 2019cad), exceeding $\gtrsim$2 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg, indicates there is a possibility of a jittering jet explosion mechanism driving these events. Additionally, a correlation analysis identifies linear dependencies among parameters derived from light curve analysis, revealing positive correlations between rise and decay times, $P_\textrm{i}$ and $B$, $P_\textrm{i}$ and $R_\textrm{p}$, and $E_\textrm{exp}$ and $R_\textrm{p}$, as well as strong anti-correlations of $P_\textrm{i}$ and $B$ with the peak luminosity. Principal Component Analysis is also applied to key parameters to reduce dimensionality, allowing a clearer visualization of SESNe distribution in a lower-dimensional space. This approach highlights the diversity in SESNe characteristics, underscoring unique physical properties and behaviour across different events in the sample. This study motivates further study on a more extended sample of SESNe to look for millisecond magnetars as their powering source.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Physics in Ultradense Environment: a Review on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the Relation between the Inclination Angle of the Accretion Disk and the Broad-line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of active galactic nuclei often invoke a close physical association between the broad-line region and the accretion disk. We evaluate this theoretical expectation by investigating the relationship between the inclination angle of the BLR ($\theta_\mathrm{BLR}$) and the inclination angle of the inner accretion disk ($\theta_\mathrm{disk}$). For a sample of eight active galactic nuclei that have published values of $\theta_\mathrm{BLR}$ estimated from dynamical modeling of the BLR based on velocity-resolved reverberation mapping experiments, we analyze high-quality, joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR X-ray observations to derive new, robust measurements of $\theta_\mathrm{disk}$ through broadband (0.3--78\,keV) reflection spectroscopy. We find a strong, positive correlation between $\theta_\mathrm{BLR}$ and $\theta_\mathrm{disk}$ (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.856, $p$-value 0.007), although Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the level of significance is only marginal ($&lt;3\,\sigma$). Nevertheless, the nearly linear relation between $\theta_\mathrm{BLR}$ and $\theta_\mathrm{disk}$ suggests of a possible physical alignment between the accretion disk and the BLR. Future studies with a larger and more homogeneous sample are needed to confirm the correlation and refine our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the central regions of active galaxies.</description>

      <title>SIRI-2 Detection of the Gamma-ray Burst 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SIRI-2 is a collection of Strontium Iodide gamma-ray detectors sensitive at approximately 400 keV to 10 MeV, launched on the Department of Defense's STPSat-6 to geosynchronous orbit. SIRI-2 detected the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A and, unlike most GRB detectors, was not saturated and did not require any pulse pile-up corrections. The energetics of this burst as measured by SIRI-2 are consistent with those found by other instruments, and the Band function fits to the spectra are consistent with that from the unsaturated Insight and GECAM instruments, and similar to corrected spectra from the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, but softer than those found by Konus-Wind when that instrument was saturated. The total fluence measured with SIRI-2 was measured to be 0.140 +/- 0.002 erg cm-2, lower than other instruments, likely due to the increasing background of SIRI-2 forcing the calculation to use a smaller time interval. An extrapolation of the distributions of fluences from GRBs to the fluence of 221009A measured with SIRI-2 indicates bursts brighter than this one should occur about once every 4,000 years.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulations of the Kruskal-Schwarzchild instability in accelerating striped outflows I: Dynamics and energy dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical relativistic outflows are launched as Poynting-flux-dominated, yet the mechanism governing efficient magnetic dissipation, which powers the observed emission, is still poorly understood. We study magnetic energy dissipation in relativistic "striped" jets, which host current sheets separating magnetically dominated regions with opposite field polarity. The effective gravity force $g$ in the rest frame of accelerating jets drives the Kruskal-Schwarzschild instability (KSI), a magnetic analogue of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. By means of 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we study the linear and non-linear evolution of the KSI. The linear stage is well described by linear stability analysis. The non-linear stages of the KSI generate thin (skin-depth-thick) current layers, with length comparable to the dominant KSI wavelength. There, the relativistic drift-kink mode and the tearing mode drive efficient magnetic dissipation. The dissipation rate can be cast as an increase in the effective width $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ of the dissipative region, which follows $d\Delta_{\rm eff}/dt\simeq 0.05 \sqrt{\Delta_{\rm eff}\,g}$. Our results have important implications for the location of the dissipation region in gamma-ray burst and AGN jets.</description>

      <title>Influence of gravity on the quantum speed limit in neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum speed limits (QSLs) determine the minimal amount of time required for a quantum system to evolve from an initial to a final state. We investigate QSLs for the unitary evolution of the neutrino-antineutrino system in the presence of a gravitational field. It is known that the transition probabilities between neutrino and antineutrino in the framework of one and two flavors depend on the strength of the gravitational field. The behavior of the QSL time in the two-flavor system indicates fast flavor transitions as the gravitational field strength increases. Subsequently, we observe quick suppression of entanglement by exploring the speed limit for entanglement entropy of two-flavor oscillations in the neutrino-antineutrino system in the proximity of a spinning primordial black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Influence on the Quantum Speed Limit in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum speed limit (QSL) during the time evolution of neutrino-antineutrino system under the influence of the gravitational field of a spinning primordial black hole (PBH). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using the Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinates. This gravitational potential leads to an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, contributing to the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino systems. Our findings indicate that the gravitational field, expressed in BL coordinates, significantly influences the transition probabilities in two-flavor oscillations of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then apply the expression for transition probabilities between states to analyze the Bures angle, which quantifies the closeness between the initial and final states of the time-evolved flavor state. We use this concept to probe the QSL for the time evolution of the initial flavor neutrino state.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) remains a major endeavor in modern physics investigation. Axions play essential roles in the quest to understand dark matter, the strong CP problem, and various astrophysical phenomena. This paper provides a very brief overview of the current status of experimental efforts, highlighting significant advancements, ongoing projects, and future opportunities. Particular attention is given to cavity haloscopes, helioscopes, and laboratory-based light-shining-through-wall experiments, as well as astrophysical probes. Some future perspectives are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Fast Flavor Pendulum: Instability Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even in the absence of neutrino masses, a neutrino gas can exhibit a homogeneous flavor instability that leads to a periodic motion known as the fast flavor pendulum. A well-known necessary condition is a crossing of the angular flavor lepton distribution. However, in contrast to an earlier finding by two of us, the Nyquist criterion inspired by plasma physics, while being a more restrictive necessary condition, is not always sufficient. The question depends on the unstable branch of the dispersion relation being bounded by critical points that both lie under the light cone (points with subluminal phase velocity), in which case the Nyquist criterion is sufficient. While the lepton-number angle distribution, assumed to be axially symmetric, easily allows one to determine the real branch of the dispersion relation and to recognize if instead superluminal critical points exist, this graphical method does not translate into a simple instability condition. We discuss the dispersion relation for the homogeneous mode in the more general context of modes with arbitrary wave number and stress that it plays no special role on this continuum, except for its regular but fragile long-term behavior owed to its many symmetries.</description>

      <title>Molecular chemistry induced by J-shock toward supernova remnant W51C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock waves from supernova remnants (SNRs) have strong influence on the physical and chemical properties of molecular clouds (MCs). Shocks propagating into magnetized MCs can be classified into "jump" J-shock and "continuous" C-shock. The molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas behind J-shock is still not well understood, which will provide a comprehensive view of the chemical feedback of SNRs and the chemical effects of J-shock. We conducted a W-band (71.4-89.7 GHz) observation toward a re-formed molecular clump behind a J-shock induced by SNR W51C with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope to study the molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas. Based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we estimate the column densities of HCO+, HCN, C2H and o-c-C3H2, and derive the maps of their abundance ratios with CO. The gas density is constrained by non-LTE analysis of the HCO+ J=1-0 line. We obtain the following abundance ratios: $N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.0\text{--}4.0)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm HCN})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.8\text{--}5.3)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm C_2H})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.6\text{--}5.0)\times 10^{-3}$, and $N({o\text{-}c\text{-}{\rm C_3H_2}})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.2\text{--}7.9)\times 10^{-4}$. The non-LTE analysis suggests that the gas density is $n_{\rm H_2}\gtrsim 10^4\rm \ cm^{-3}$. We find that the N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO) are higher than typical values in quiescent MCs and shocked MCs by 1-2 orders of magnitude, which can be qualitatively attributed to the abundant C+ and C at the earliest phase of molecular gas re-formation. The Paris-Durham shock code can reproduce, although not perfectly, the observed abundance ratios, especially the enhanced N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO), with J-shocks propagating in to both non-irradiated and irradiated molecular gas with a preshock density of $n_{\rm H}=2\times 10^3\rm \ cm^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Exploring nuclear force with pulsar glitch observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We connect nuclear forces to one of the most notable irregular behaviors observed in pulsars, already detected in approximately 6\% known pulsars, with increasingly accurate data expected from upcoming high-precision timing instruments on both ground and space. Built on \cite{Shang2021_ApJ923-108}, we conduct a case study on the 2001 glitch of the Vela pulsar. For our purpose, we adopt the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model as the theoretical many-body framework to describe nuclear systems. We refit three representative RMF parameter sets (DD-ME2, PKDD, NL3), considering the uncertainties in nuclear matter saturation properties. Utilizing the resulting star structure, composition and nucleon properties in the medium obtained in a consistent manner, we calculate the pinning energy of superfluid vortex in the nuclear lattice in the inner crust. This leads to the evolution of associated pinning force that acts on the vortex, which can be confronted with observed glitch amplitude and short-time relaxation in the 2000 Vela glitch event, following the superfluidity model of pulsar glitch. We discuss how the vortex configuration and pinning properties depend on the nuclear parameters, and find an interesting and dominant role of the nuclear symmetry energy slope on pinning strength.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}-10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $10^{16}-10^{18}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Additionally, we also account for photon flux from positron annihilation due to Hawking radiation in our calculations. Our findings indicate that directly using observational data significantly tightens constraints on PBHs with masses above $10^{17}$ g, owing to Insight-HXMT's exceptional sensitivity to hard X-rays. Incorporating the ABM further enhances the constraints by approximately 0.8 orders of magnitude. The exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter extends to $8\times 10^{17}$ g, nearly doubling the current threshold. Moreover, extrapolating the energy limit with a power-law model improves constraints by approximately one order of magnitude compared to the ABM scenario.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation from a relativistic jet induced by a plane gravitational wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic radiation of a relativistic gas or plasma jet in the field of a plane gravitational wave is investigated. The gravitational wave is considered as a weak (linearized) field on flat Minkowski spacetime. It is assumed that the relativistic jet has large regions with uncompensated electric charge. The deformation of these areas under the action of a gravitational wave leads to the appearance of electric currents that generate electromagnetic radiation. The angular distribution of the intensity of this radiation is found. Cases are considered when the jet and the gravitational wave move in the same direction or towards each other.</description>

      <title>Using nebular near-IR spectroscopy to measure asymmetric chemical distributions in 2003fg-like thermonuclear supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of three near-infrared (NIR; 1.0-2.4 $\mu$m) spectra of the SN 2003fg-like/"super-Chandrasekhar" type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) SN 2009dc, SN 2020hvf, and SN 2022pul at respective phases +372, +296, and +294~d relative to the epoch of $B$-band maximum. We find that all objects in our sample have asymmetric, or "tilted", [Fe~II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m profiles. We quantify the asymmetry of these features using five methods: velocity at peak flux, profile tilts, residual testing, velocity fitting, and comparison to deflagration-detonation transition models. Our results demonstrate that, while the profiles of the [Fe II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m features are widely varied between 2003fg-likes, these features are correlated in shape within the same SN. This implies that line blending is most likely not the dominant cause of the asymmetries inferred from these profiles. Instead, it is more plausible that 2003fg-like SNe have aspherical chemical distributions in their inner regions. These distributions may come from aspherical progenitor systems, such as double white dwarf mergers, or off-center delayed-detonation explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs. Additional late-phase NIR observation of 2003fg-like SNe and detailed 3-D NLTE modeling of these two explosion scenarios are encouraged.</description>

      <title>Extended Skyrme effective interactions with higher-order momentum-dependence for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently developed extended Skyrme effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is generalized to the general N$n$LO case by incorporating the derivative terms up to 2$n$th-order into the central term of the pseudopotential. The corresponding expressions of Hamiltonian density and single-nucleon potential are derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation under general nonequilibrium conditions. The inclusion of the higher-order derivative terms provides additional higher-order momentum dependence for the single-nucleon potential, and in particular, we find that the N5LO single-nucleon potential with momentum dependent terms up to $p^{10}$ can give a nice description for the empirical nucleon optical potential up to energy of $2$ GeV. At the same time, the density-dependent terms in the extended Skyrme effective interaction are extended correspondingly in the spirit of the Fermi momentum expansion, which allows highly flexible variation of density behavior for both the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and the symmetry energy. Based on the Skyrme pseudopotential up to N3LO, N4LO and N5LO, we construct a series of interactions with the nucleon optical potential having different high-momentum behaviors and the symmetry potentials featuring different linear isospin-splitting coefficients for nucleon effective mass, by which we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Furthermore, within the lattice BUU transport model, some benchmark simulations with selected interactions are performed for the Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$ GeV/nucleon, and the predicted collective flows for protons are found to nicely agree with the data measured by HADES collaboration.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Search for Short Timescale Periodicity in Four Active Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08971v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with millisecond durations which typically occur at extragalactic distances. The association of FRB 20200428 with the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 strongly indicates that they could originate from neutron stars, which naturally leads to the expectation that periodicity connected with the spinning of magnetars should exist in the activities of repeating FRBs. However, previous studies have failed to find any signatures supporting such a conjecture. Here we perform a thorough search for short timescale periodicity in the four most active repeating sources, i.e. FRBs 20121102A, 20200120E, 20201124A, and 20220912A. Three different methods are employed, including the phase folding algorithm, the H-test and the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. For the three most active repeaters from which more than 1000 bursts have been detected, i.e. FRBs 20121102A, 20201124A, and 20220912A, more in-depth period searches are conducted by considering various burst properties such as the pulse width, peak flux, fluence, and the brightness temperature. No clear periodicity is found in a period range of 0.001--1000 s in all the efforts. Implications of such a null result on the theoretical models of FRBs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Potential to Constrain Dark Matter Annihilation with Fermi-LAT Observations of Ultra-Faint Compact Stellar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from numerical simulations and models of galaxy formation suggest that recently discovered ultra-faint compact stellar systems (UFCSs) in the halo of the Milky Way (MW) may be some of the smallest and faintest galaxies. If this is the case, these systems would be attractive targets for indirect searches of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) annihilation due to their relative proximity and high expected DM content. In this study, we analyze 14.3 years of gamma-ray data collected by the Fermi-LAT coincident with 26 UFCSs. No significant excess gamma-ray emission is detected, and we present gamma-ray flux upper limits for these systems. Assuming that the UFCSs are dark-matter-dominated galaxies consistent with being among the faintest and least massive MW dwarf spheroidal (dSphs) satellite galaxies, we derive the projected sensitivity for a dark matter annihilation signal. We find that observations of UFCSs have the potential to yield some of the most powerful constraints on DM annihilation, with sensitivity comparable to observations of known dSphs and the Galactic center. This result emphasizes the importance of precise kinematic studies of UFCSs to empirically determine their DM content.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multiple X-Ray Reflection in Super-Eddington Winds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently discovered that a few super-Eddington sources undergoing black hole super-Eddington accretion exhibit X-ray reflection signatures. In such new systems, one expects that the coronal X-ray emissions are mainly reflected by optically thick super-Eddington winds instead of thin disks. In this paper, we conduct a series of general relativistic ray-tracing and Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to model the X-ray reflection signatures, especially the characteristic Fe K$\alpha$ line, produced from super-Eddington accretion flows around non-spinning black holes. In particular, we allow the photons emitted by a lamppost corona to be reflected multiple times in a cone-like funnel surrounded by fast winds. We find that the Fe K$\alpha$ line profile most sensitively depends on the wind kinematics, while its exact shape also depends on the funnel open angle and corona height. Furthermore, very interestingly, we find that the Fe K$\alpha$ line can have a prominent double-peak profile in certain parameter spaces even with a face-on orientation. Moreover, we compare the Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles produced from super-Eddington and thin disks and show that such lines can provide important insights into the understanding of black hole systems undergoing super-Eddington accretion.</description>

Abstract: We report on the discovery of polarized X-ray emission from an accreting millisecond pulsar. During a 10-day-long coverage of the February 2024 outburst of SRGA J144459.2-604207, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) detected an average polarization degree of the 2-8 keV emission of 2.3% +/- 0.4% at an angle of 59{\deg} +/- 6{\deg} (East of North; uncertainties quoted at the 1${\sigma}$ confidence level). The polarized signal shows a significant energy dependence with a degree of 4.0% +/- 0.5% between 3 and 6 keV and &lt; 1.5% (90% c.l.) in the 2-3 keV range. We used NICER, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations to obtain an accurate pulse timing solution and perform a phase-resolved polarimetric analysis of IXPE data. We did not detect any significant variability of the Stokes parameters Q and U with the spin and the orbital phases. We used the relativistic rotating vector model to show that a moderately fan-beam emission from two point-like spots at a small magnetic obliquity ($\simeq$ 10{\deg}) is compatible with the observed pulse profile and polarization properties. IXPE also detected 52 type-I X-ray bursts, with a recurrence time $\Delta t_{rec}$ increasing from 2 to 8 h as a function of the observed count rate $C$ as as $\Delta t_{rec} \simeq C^{-0.8}$ We stacked the emission observed during all the bursts and obtained an upper limit on the polarization degree of 8.5% (90% c.l.).</description>

      <title>Study of a Tilted Thin Accretion Disk around a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accreting collapsed object GRO J1655-40 could contain the gravitomagnetic monopole (GMM), and it was shown to be better described by the Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) spacetime instead of the Kerr spacetime. The warped accretion disk has also been observed for the same collapsed object. Motivated by these, we study a tilted thin inner accretion disk around a KTN black hole. Such a tilting could have a significant effect on the X-ray spectral and timing features via the Lense-Thirring effect. Taking into account the contribution from the inner accretion disk for the KTN black hole, here we calculate the radial profile of a tilt angle. Depending on the numerical values of the viscosity of the accreting material and Kerr parameter, GMM tends the angular momentum of the disk to align along the black hole's spin axis, or to make it more tilted. Our solution for the radial profile of the tilted disk around a KTN black hole could be useful to probe the strong gravity regime, and could also give indirect evidence for the existence of GMM in nature.</description>

      <title>Superflare on a rapidly-rotating solar-type star captured in X-rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we studied X-ray source SRGe~J021932.4$-$040154 (SRGe J021932), which we associated with a single X-ray active star of spectral class G2V-G4V and the rotational period $\rm P_{rot} &lt; 9.3$ days. Additional analysis of TESS light-curves allowed for the rotational period estimation of $3.2 \pm 0.5$ days. SRGe J021932 was observed with the SRG/eROSITA during eUDS survey in 2019 in a much dimmer state compared to the XMM-Newton catalogue 4XMM-DR12. Detailed analysis revealed that the archival XMM-Newton observations captured the source during a flaring event in 2017. The XMM-Newton light curve demonstrates a strong flare described with the Gaussian rise and exponential decay, typical for stellar flares, characterized by timescales of ${\sim}400$~s and ${\sim}1300$~s, respectively. The spectral analysis of the quiescent state reveals ${\sim}10$~MK plasma at luminosity of $(1.4\pm0.4) \times 10^{29}$ erg/s (0.3-4.5 keV). The spectrum of the flare is characterized by temperature of ${\sim}40$ MK and luminosity $(5.5\pm0.6)\times 10^{30}$ erg/s. The total energy emitted during the flare ${\sim}1.7 \times 10^{34}$ erg exceeds the canonical threshold of $10^{33}$ erg, allowing us to classify the observed event as a superflare on a rapidly-rotating solar-type star. Additionally, we present the upper limit on the surface starspot area based on the brightness variations and consider the hypothesis of the object being a binary system with G-type and M-type stars, suggested by two independent estimations of radial velocity variations from APOGEE-2 and Gaia.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multiband Photometry of the Early Optical Afterglow of GRB 240825A with Mephisto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the universe. The interaction of the relativistic jet with the circumburst medium produces an afterglow and generates multiwavelength emission. In this work, we present simultaneous multiband photometry of GRB~240825A with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) and analyze its temporal and spectral properties. The measurement began 128 seconds after the GRB trigger and continued until the fourth day when the afterglow essentially diminished and the measured brightness was close to that of the host galaxy. Based on the multiband light curves in the $uvgriz$ bands, we find that the optical flux density satisfies $F_{\nu,{\rm obs}}\propto t^{-1.34}\nu^{-2.48}$ with a spectral index of $2.48$ much larger than those of most other GRBs. To reconcile the measured much softer spectral energy distribution (SED) with that predicted by the standard afterglow model, an extra host-galaxy extinction of $E_{B-V}\sim(0.37-0.57)$ mag is required. We interpreted this excess as arising from a dense circumburst medium. We further find that the SED of the optical afterglow hardened as the afterglow decayed and the color excess $E_{B-V}$ decreased $\sim0.26$ mag from 100 seconds to 3000 seconds after the GRB trigger. Finally, we analyze the properties of the host galaxy of GRB~240825A based on data from the SDSS, PanSTARRS and HSC-SSP surveys. For a host redshift of $z=0.659$, the stellar mass and star formation rate of the host galaxy are estimated to be $\log(M_*/M_\odot)=10.0^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ and $\log({\rm SFR}/M_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1})= 0.6^{+0.8}_{-3.3}$, respectively, pointing to a gas-rich, star-forming, medium-size galaxy.</description>

      <title>Relativistic reconnection with effective resistivity: I. Dynamics and reconnection rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is one of the most fundamental mechanisms considered responsible for the acceleration of relativistic particles in astrophysical jets and magnetospheres of compact objects. Understanding the properties of the dissipation of magnetic fields and the formation of non-ideal electric fields is of paramount importance to quantify the efficiency of reconnection at energizing charged particles. Recent results from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations suggest that the fundamental properties of how magnetic fields dissipate in a current sheet might be captured by an "effective resistivity" formulation, which would locally enhance the amount of magnetic energy dissipated and favor the onset of fast reconnection. Our goal is to assess this ansatz quantitatively by comparing fluid models of magnetic reconnection with a non-constant magnetic diffusivity and fully-kinetic models. We perform 2D resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations of magnetic reconnection combined to PIC simulations using the same initial conditions (namely a Harris current sheet). We explore the impact of crucial parameters such as the plasma magnetization, its mass density, the grid resolution, and the characteristic plasma skin depth. Our ResRMHD models with effective resistivity can quantitatively reproduce the dynamics of fully-kinetic models of relativistic magnetic reconnection. In particular, they lead to reconnection rates consistent with PIC simulations, while for constant-resistivity fluid models the reconnection dynamics is generally 10 times slower. Even at modest resolutions the adoption of an effective resistivity can qualitatively capture the properties of kinetic reconnection models and produce reconnection rates compatible with collisionless models, i.e. of the order of $\sim10^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Long-Term Flaring Events of Blazar PKS 0805-07: A Multi-Wavelength Analysis over the 2009-2023 Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the FSRQ PKS 0805-07 by using the broadband observations from the Fermi-LAT and Swift-XRT/UVOT instruments over the period MJD 54684-60264. The 3-day binned $\gamma$-ray light curve during the active state, revealed eleven distinct peak structures with the maximum integral flux (E $&gt;$ 100 MeV) reached $(1.56\pm 0.16)\times10^{-6}\, \text{photons cm}^{-2}\, \text{s}^{-1}$ on MJD 59904.5. The shortest observed $\gamma$-ray variability was $2.80\pm 0.77$ days. A correlation analysis between the $\gamma$-ray spectral index and flux indicated the typical trend of hardening when the source is brighter, commonly observed in blazars. We identified a lag of 121 (+27.21, -3.51) days in the spectral index relative to the flux, within the time interval MJD 59582 to 60112. The Anderson-Darling test and histogram-fit rejected the normality of the $\gamma$-ray flux distribution, and instead suggest a log-normal distribution. To gain insight into the underlying physical processes, we extracted broadband spectra from different time periods in the light curve. The spectral energy distribution during various flux states were well-reproduced using synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton, and external-Compton emissions from a broken power-law electron distribution. The seed photons required for the external Compton process are from IR region. A comparison of the best-fit physical parameters indicated that the variations in different flux states were primarily associated with an increase in the bulk Lorentz factor and magnetic field from low to high flux states.</description>

      <title>Not just winds: why models find binary black hole formation is metallicity dependent, while binary neutron star formation is not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both detailed and rapid population studies alike predict that binary black hole (BHBH) formation is orders of magnitude more efficient at low metallicity than high metallicity, while binary neutron star (NSNS) formation remains mostly flat with metallicity, and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers show intermediate behavior. This finding is a key input to employ double compact objects as tracers of low-metallicity star formation, as spectral sirens, and for merger rate calculations. Yet, the literature offers various (sometimes contradicting) explanations for these trends. We investigate the dominant cause for the metallicity dependence of double compact object formation. We find that the BHBH formation efficiency at low metallicity is set by initial condition distributions, and conventional simulations suggest that about \textit{one in eight interacting binary systems} with sufficient mass to form black holes will lead to a merging BHBH. We further find that the significance of metallicities in double compact object formation is a question of formation channel. The stable mass transfer and chemically homogeneous evolution channels mainly diminish at high metallicities due to changes in stellar radii, while the common envelope channel is primarily impacted by the combined effects of stellar winds and mass-scaled natal kicks. Outdated giant wind prescriptions exacerbate the latter effect, suggesting BHBH formation may be much less metallicity dependent than previously assumed. NSNS formation efficiency remains metallicity independent as they form exclusively through the common envelope channel, with natal kicks that are assumed uncorrelated with mass. Forthcoming GW observations will provide valuable constraints on these findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present arguments that the neutrinos observed by IceCube from the active galactic nucleus TXS 0506+056 may originate near its core and not in the blazar jet. The origin of the neutrinos is consistent with the mechanism that produces the neutrino flux observed from the active galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 4151, but requires an Eddington luminosity cosmic ray flux to compensate for its larger distance. Like NGC 1068, the source is characterized by episodes of high X-ray emission and is gamma-ray-obscured during the 2014 burst, and there is evidence that this is also the case during the short burst in 2017 that produced IC-170922. The observations may be explained as a flux originating in an obscured core within $10 \sim 100$ Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole, which is not transparent to gamma rays from neutral pions accompanying the neutrinos.</description>

      <title>JWST meets Chandra: a large population of Compton thick, feedback-free, and intrinsically X-ray weak AGN, with a sprinkle of SNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the X-ray properties of a sample of 71 broad line and narrow line AGN at 2$&lt;$z$&lt;$11 discovered by JWST in the GOODS fields, which have the deepest Chandra observations ever obtained. Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -UV spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non-detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN SED. X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton-thick) column density and low dust content, such as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasars; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of H$\alpha$ in JWST-selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack prominent, fast outflows, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST-selected AGN matches the definition of NLSy1, typically accreting at high rates and characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum -- this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to Very Massive Stars or Supernovae, although we show that some of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with superluminous SNe.</description>

      <title>Ringdown of a postinnermost stable circular orbit of a rapidly spinning black hole: Mass ratio dependence of higher harmonic quasinormal mode excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a binary merger with a small mass ratio, as the secondary body approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the primary black hole, the motion transitions from the adiabatic inspiral to the plunge governed by the geodesic equation. The plunge orbit is expected to excite the ringdown gravitational wave, which encodes information about the primary black hole's geometry. The details of the transition regime depend on the binary's mass ratio through radiation fluxes, which in turn influence the initial conditions for the plunge. As such, the mass ratio affects the post-ISCO ringdown gravitational wave excitation. In this study, we numerically investigate the mass ratio dependence of higher harmonic quasi-normal mode excitations in the post-ISCO gravitational waves of rapidly spinning black holes, based on the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. We consider the effect of mass ratio on the gravitational waves by accounting for the energy and angular momentum losses during the transition regime following the Ori-Thorne procedure. We examine two mass ratio scenarios: the intermediate mass ratio (IMR) and the extreme mass ratio (EMR). Our main finding is that higher harmonic quasi-normal modes are significantly excited in an IMR merger involving a highly spinning primary black hole. This implies that detecting an IMR merger involving such a primary black hole with space-based gravitational wave interferometers can provide valuable opportunities to infer black hole properties or test general relativity with excellent precision.</description>

      <title>Formation of giant radio sources in galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing debates. We utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. To avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). Finally, we also study the energy transport processes of different jets. We find the 'lower power-larger bubble' effect: lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of eccentric, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) immersed in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei. We find that single gravitational-wave observations from these systems could provide measurements with ~ 10 % relative precision of, simultaneously, the disk viscosity and mass accretion rate of the central supermassive black hole. This is possible when the EMRI transitions, within the observation time, from supersonic to subsonic motion relative to the disk gas, for eccentricities e &gt; ~ 0.025-0.1. The estimate of the accretion rate would assist in the identification of the EMRI's host galaxy, or the observation of a direct electromagnetic counterpart, improving the chances of using these sources as cosmological sirens. Our work highlights the rich phenomenology of binary evolution in astrophysical environments and the need to improve the modelling and analysis of these systems for future gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Temperature versus Orbital Period relation of AM CVns: Insights from their Donors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 22 known AM~CVns with orbital periods ($P_{orb}$) larger than 35~min using multiwavelength public photometric data to estimate the effective temperature of the accreting white dwarf. We find an infrared (IR) excess in all systems when compared to a single blackbody, both when the disk should be extended and when it should be truncated by the accretor's magnetic field. This suggests a dominant contribution from the donor to the IR flux. When fitting two blackbodies, the temperature of the hot component decreases with $P_{orb}$, as expected by evolutionary models. Temperatures for systems with $35&lt;P_{orb}&lt;45~\text{min}$ are consistent with models. Systems with $P_{orb}\gtrsim45~\text{min}$ have higher temperatures than expected. The second blackbody temperature does not correlate with $P_{orb}$.</description>
