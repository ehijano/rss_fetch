      <title>Doughnut or Mickey Mouse? Detecting Toroidal Structure in Data through Persistent Cup-Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of high-dimensional data is fundamental to neuroscience and other data-intensive scientific fields. While persistent homology effectively identifies basic topological features such as "holes," it lacks the ability to reliably detect more complex topologies, particularly toroidal structures, despite previous heuristic attempts. To address this limitation, recent work introduced persistent cup-length, a novel topological invariant derived from persistent cohomology. In this paper, we present the first implementation of this method and demonstrate its practical effectiveness in detecting toroidal structures, uncovering topological features beyond the reach of persistent homology alone. Our implementation overcomes computational bottlenecks through strategic optimization, efficient integration with the Ripser library, and the application of landmark subsampling techniques. By applying our method to grid cell population activity data, we demonstrate that persistent cup-length effectively identifies toroidal structures in neural manifolds. Our approach offers a powerful new tool for analyzing high-dimensional data, advancing existing topological methods.</description>

      <title>Cappell-Shaneson polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S. Cappell and J. Shaneson constructed a pair of inequivalent embeddings of $(n-1)$-spheres in homotopy $(n+1)$-spheres for every square matrix of order $n$ with special properties (a Cappell-Shaneson matrix). A Cappell-Shaneson polynomial is the characteristic polynomial of a Cappell-Shaneson matrix. In this paper, we interpret part of the definition of Cappell-Shaneson polynomial as algebraic conditions on polynomials in terms of signed reciprocal polynomial and reduction modulo primes, and give complete lists of all Cappell-Shaneson polynomials of degrees $4$ and $5$. We construct several infinite series of Cappell-Shaneson polynomials of degree $6$.</description>

      <title>Computational Approaches to the Singer Transfer: Preimages in the Lambda Algebra and $G_k$-Invariant Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic, algorithmic method to compute the preimage of elements under the Singer algebraic transfer. Using the lambda algebra and the invariant-theoretic formula of P.H. Chon and L.M. Ha [5], we formulate the preimage search as a solvable problem in linear algebra. This framework is applied to study key indecomposable elements in the Adams spectral sequence. As a consequence, we show that the proof of the known result that $d_0$ lies in the image of the fourth Singer transfer, as given by Nguyen Sum in [17], is false. Furthermore, we provide the explicit description of a preimage for the element $p_0 \in Ext^{4,4+33}_{\mathcal A}(\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2).$ This preimage had not been explicitly determined in the previous work of N.H.V. Hung and V.T.N. Quynh [8]. Finally, our most significant contribution is the construction of a complete \textsc{SageMath} algorithm that fully automates the computation of both the dimension and an explicit basis for the $G_k$-invariant space $[(Q\mathcal{P}_k)_d]^{G_k}$. This tool facilitates the verification of our results [11, 12, 13] that were previously computed manually in connection with Singer's conjecture for rank 4.</description>
