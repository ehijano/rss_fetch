      <title>Non-Markovian Reduced Models to Unravel Transitions in Non-equilibrium Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a general framework for capturing noise-driven transitions in spatially extended non-equilibrium systems and explains the emergence of coherent patterns beyond the instability onset. The framework relies on stochastic parameterizations to reduce the original equations' complexity while capturing the key effects of unresolved scales. It works for both Gaussian and Levy-type noise. Our parameterizations offer two key advantages. First, they approximate stochastic invariant manifolds when the latter exist. Second, even when such manifolds break down, our formulas can be adapted by a simple optimization of its constitutive parameters. This allows us to handle scenarios with weak time-scale separation where the system has undergone multiple transitions, resulting in large-amplitude solutions not captured by invariant manifold or other time-scale separation methods. The optimized stochastic parameterizations capture how small-scale noise impacts larger scales through the system's nonlinear interactions. This effect is achieved by the very fabric of our parameterizations incorporating non-Markovian coefficients into the reduced equation. Such coefficients account for the noise's past influence using a finite memory length, selected for optimal performance. The specific "memory" function, which determines how this past influence is weighted, depends on the noise's strength and how it interacts with the system's nonlinearities. Remarkably, training our theory-guided reduced models on a single noise path effectively learns the optimal memory length for out-of-sample predictions, including rare events. This success stems from our "hybrid" approach, which combines analytical understanding with data-driven learning. This combination avoids a key limitation of purely data-driven methods: their struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, also known as the "extrapolation problem."</description>

      <title>Cocycles with Quasi-Conformality I: Stability and prevalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first part of a series of papers devoted to the study of linear cocycles over chaotic systems. In the present paper, we show that every $\mathrm{SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$ cocycle over a shift of finite type either admits a dominated splitting or is $\mathcal{C}^0$-approximated by a cocycle that $\mathcal{C}^\alpha$-stably exhibits bounded orbits ($\alpha&gt;0$). The proof is based on a new mechanism which yields stable elliptic-type behavior in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, Cohomology and Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth Morse-Smale vector field with Lyapunov constraints (Lyapunov function) one shows how and why the non-triviality of the additive structure of the cohomology detects rest points and the multiplicative structure of the cohomology detects instantons. The same remains true for Lyapunov closed one form but in this presentation this fact is discussed only informally. These observations are based on the smooth " manifold with corner structures" of the stable/unstable sets and of the set of trajectories of such vector fields.

      <description>arXiv:2408.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ergodic properties (recurrence, discrepancy, diffusion coefficients and ergodicity itself) of a class of $\mathbb Z$-extensions over infinite interval exchange transformations called rotated odometers. The choice of a skew-function is motivated by the use in the study of parallel flows on a particular staircase manifold of infinite genus.</description>

      <title>Depinning of discommensurations for tilted Frenkel-Kontorova chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an untilted Frenkel-Kontorova chain and any rational $p/q$, Aubry and Mather proved there are minimising equilibrium states that are left- and right-asymptotic to neighbouring pairs of spatially periodic minimisers of type $(p,q)$. They are known as {\em discommensurations} (or kinks or fronts), {\em advancing }if the right-asymptotic equilibrium is to the right of the left-asymptotic one, {\em retreating} otherwise. Following work of Middleton, Floria \&amp; Mazo and Baesens \&amp; MacKay, there is a threshold tilt $F_d(p/q)\ge 0$ up to which there continue to be periodic equilibria of type $(p,q)$ and above which there is a globally attracting periodically sliding solution in the space of sequences of type $(p,q)$.
  In this paper, we prove that there are values $F_d(p/q\pm)$ of tilt with $0\le F_d(p/q\pm) \le F_d(p/q)$, generically positive and less than $F_d(p/q)$, up to which there continue to be equilibrium advancing or retreating discommensurations, respectively, and such that for $F_d(p/q\pm) &lt; F &lt; F_d(p/q)$ there are periodically sliding discommensurations, apart perhaps from exceptional cases with both a degenerate type $(p,q)$ equilibrium and a degenerate advancing equilibrium discommensuration. We give examples, however, to show that equilibrium and periodically sliding discommensurations may co-exist, both above and below $F_d(p/q\pm)$, so the case of discommensurations is not as clean as that of periodic configurations.
  On the way, we prove that $F_d(\omega) \to F_d(p/q\pm)$ as $\omega \searrow p/q$ or $\nearrow p/q$ respectively. Finally, we prove that $F_d(p/q\pm)=0$ is equivalent to the existence of a rotational invariant circle consisting of periodic orbits of type $(p,q)$ and right-going (respectively left-going) separatrices, for the corresponding twist map on the cylinder.</description>

      <title>On the Zoll deformations of the Kepler problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Bertrand states that the only central force potentials on the plane with the property that all bounded orbits are periodic are the Kepler potential and the potential of the harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we complement Bertrand's theorem showing the existence of an infinite dimensional space of central force potentials on the plane which are Zoll at a given energy level, meaning that all non-collision orbits with given energy are closed and of the same length. We also determine all natural systems on the (not necessarily flat) plane which are invariant under rotations and Zoll at a given energy and prove several existence and rigidity results for systems which are Zoll at multiple energies.</description>

      <title>Modification speed alters stability of ecological higher-order interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions (HOIs) have the potential to greatly increase our understanding of ecological interaction networks beyond what is possible with established models that usually consider only pairwise interactions between organisms. While equilibrium values of such HOI-based models have been studied, the dynamics of these models and the stability of their equilibria remain underexplored. Here we present a novel investigation on the effect of the onset speed of a higher-order interaction. In particular, we study the stability of the equilibrium of all configurations of a three-species interaction network, including transitive as well as intransitive ones. We show that the HOI onset speed has a dramatic effect on the evolution and stability of the ecological network, with significant structural changes compared to commonly used HOI extensions or pairwise networks. Changes in the HOI onset speed from fast to slow can reverse the stability of the interaction network. The evolution of the system also affects the equilibrium that will be reached, influenced by the HOI onset speed. This implies that the HOI onset speed is an important determinant in the dynamics of ecological systems, and including it in models of ecological networks can improve our understanding thereof.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-based schemes for on-the-fly parameter estimation in dissipative dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies two particular algorithms, a Relaxation Least Squares (RLS) algorithm and a Relaxation Newton Iteration (RNI) scheme , for reconstructing unknown parameters in dissipative dynamical systems. Both algorithms are based on a continuous data assimilation (CDA) algorithm for state reconstruction of A. Azouani, E. Olson, and E.S. Titi \cite{Azouani_Olson_Titi_2014}. Due to the CDA origins of these parameter recovery algorithms, these schemes provide on-the-fly reconstruction, that is, as data is collected, of unknown state and parameters simultaneously. It is shown how both algorithms give way to a robust general framework for simultaneous state and parameter estimation. In particular, we develop a general theory, applicable to a large class of dissipative dynamical systems, which identifies structural and algorithmic conditions under which the proposed algorithms achieve reconstruction of the true parameters. The algorithms are implemented on a high-dimensional two-layer Lorenz 96 model, where the theoretical conditions of the general framework are explicitly verifiable. They are also implemented on the two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithms beyond the finite-dimensional setting. In each case, systematic numerical experiments are carried out probing the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, in addition to the apparent benefits and drawbacks between them.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and Excitable Dynamics in an Opinion Model with Group Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional models of opinion dynamics, each agent in a network has an opinion and changes in opinions arise from pairwise (i.e., dyadic) interactions between agents. However, in many situations, groups of individuals can possess a collective opinion that may differ from the opinions of the individuals. In this paper, we study the effects of group opinions on opinion dynamics. We formulate a hypergraph model in which both individual agents and groups of 3 agents have opinions, and we examine how opinions evolve through both dyadic interactions and group memberships. In some parameter regimes, we find that the presence of group opinions can lead to oscillatory and excitable opinion dynamics. In the oscillatory regime, the mean opinion of the agents in a network has self-sustained oscillations. In the excitable regime, finite-size effects create large but short-lived opinion swings (as in social fads). We develop a mean-field approximation of our model and obtain good agreement with direct numerical simulations. We also show, both numerically and via our mean-field description, that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number of dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated. Our results illustrate how polyadic structures, such as groups of agents, can have important effects on collective opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the set of stable primes for postcritically infinite maps over number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many interesting questions in arithmetic dynamics revolve, in one way or another, around the (local and/or global) reducibility behavior of iterates of a polynomial. We show that for very general families of integer polynomials $f$ (and, more generally, rational functions over number fields), the set of stable primes, i.e., primes modulo which all iterates of $f$ are irreducible, is a density zero set. Compared to previous results, our families cover a much wider ground, and in particular apply to $100\%$ of polynomials of any given odd degree, thus adding evidence to the conjecture that polynomials with a ``large" set of stable primes are necessarily of a very specific shape, and in particular are necessarily postcritically finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isospectral set of the Dirac matrix D=d+d* consists of orthogonal Q for which Q* D Q is an equivalent Dirac matrix. It can serve as the symmetry of a finite geometry G. The symmetry is a subset of the orthogonal group or unitary group and isospectral Lax deformations produce commuting flows d/dt D=[B(g(D)),D] on this symmetry space. In this note, we remark that like in the Toda case, D_t=Q_t* D_0 Q_t with exp(-t g(D))=Q_t R_t solves the Lax system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on Bitcoin (BTC) transactions is a matter of interest for both economic and network science fields. Although this cryptocurrency is based on a decentralized system, making transaction details freely accessible, making raw blockchain data analyzable is not straightforward due to the Bitcoin protocol specificity and data richness. To address the need for an accessible dataset, we present ORBITAAL, the first comprehensive dataset based on temporal graph formalism. The dataset covers all Bitcoin transactions from January 2009 to January 2021. ORBITAAL provides temporal graph representations of entity-entity transaction networks, snapshots and stream graph. Each transaction value is given in Bitcoin and US dollar regarding daily-based conversion rate. This dataset also provides details on entities such as their global BTC balance and associated public addresses.</description>

Abstract: For $\mathbb Q$-factorial klt algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures, we prove the cone theorem, the contraction theorem, and the existence of flips. Therefore, we deduce the existence of the minimal model program for such structures.
  We also prove the base-point-freeness theorem for such structures of general type and establish an adjunction formula and the existence of $\mathbb Q$-factorial quasi-dlt modifications for algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain results about the positive definiteness, the continuity and the level-boundedness of two optimal value functions of specific parametric optimization problems. Those two optimization problems are generalizations of special functions called comparison functions which arise in dynamical systems stability theory.</description>

      <title>Two conjectures on coarse conjugacy by Geller and Misiurewicz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their study of coarse entropy, W. Geller and M. Misiurewicz introduced the notion of coarse conjugacy: a version of conjugacy appropriate for dynamics on metric spaces observed from afar. They made two conjectures on coarse conjugacy generalising their results. We disprove both of these conjectures. We investigate the impact of extra assumptions on the validity of the conjectures: We show that the result of Geller and Misiurewicz towards one of the conjectures can be considered optimal, and we prove the other conjecture under an assumption complementary to that from the referenced work.</description>

      <title>Blow-up behavior for ODEs with normally hyperbolic nature in dynamics at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe blow-up behavior for ODEs by means of dynamics at infinity with complex asymptotic behavior in autonomous systems, as well as in nonautonomous systems. Based on preceding studies, a variant of closed embeddings of phase spaces and the time-scale transformation determined by the structure of vector fields at infinity reduce our description of blow-ups to unravel the shadowing property of (pre)compact trajectories on the horizon, the geometric object expressing the infinity, with the specific convergence rates. Geometrically, this description is organized by asymptotic phase of invariant sets on the horizon. Blow-up solutions in nonautonomous systems can be described in a similar way. As a corollary, normally, or partially hyperbolic invariant manifolds on the horizon possessing asymptotic phase are shown to induce blow-ups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Escape from a potential well occurs in a wide variety of physical systems from chemical reactions to ship capsize. In these situations escape often occurs by passage over a normally hyperbolic submanifold (NHS). This paper describes the computational implementation of an algorithm to identify the NHS of a two degree of freedom model for ship motion under the influence of damping and aperiodic forcing. Additionally we demonstrate how the stable manifolds of these submanifolds can be used to classify initial ship states as safe or unsafe.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension and Cantor set structure of sliding Shilnikov invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of sliding Shilnikov connection has been recently introduced and represents an important notion in Filippov systems, because its existence implies chaotic behavior on an invariant subset of the system. The investigation of its properties has just begun, and understanding the topology and complexity of its invariant set is of interest. In this paper, we conduct a local analysis on the first return map associated to a Shilnikov sliding connection, which reveals a conformal iterated function system (CIFS) structure. By using the theory of CIFS, we estimate the Hausdorff dimension of the local invariant set of the first return map, showing, in particular, that it is strictly greater than $0$ and strictly less than $1$, and its one-dimensional Lebesgue measure is 0. Moreover, we prove that the closure of the local invariant set is a Cantor set and has the same Hausdorff dimension and Lebesgue measure of the original invariant set. Furthermore, it is given by the invariant set adjoined with the set of all pre-images of the regular-fold point.</description>

      <title>Density of group languages in shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density of a rational language can be understood as the frequency of some "pattern" in the shift space, for example a pattern like "words with an even number of a given letter." We study the density of group languages, i.e. rational languages recognized by morphisms onto finite groups, inside shift spaces. We show that the density with respect to any given ergodic measure on a shift space exists for every group language, because it can be computed by using any ergodic lift of the given measure to some skew product between the shift space and the recognizing group. We then further study densities in shifts of finite type (with a suitable notion of irreducibility), and then in minimal shifts. In the latter case, we obtain a closed formula for the density under the condition that the skew product has minimal closed invariant subsets which are ergodic under the product of the original measure and the uniform probability measure on the group. The formula is derived in part from a characterization of minimal closed invariant subsets for skew products relying on notions of cocycles and coboundaries. In the case where the whole skew product is ergodic under the product measure, then the density is just the cardinality of the subset of the group which defines the language divided by the cardinality of the group. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions for the skew product to have minimal closed invariant subsets that are ergodic under the product measure. Finally, we investigate the link between minimal closed invariant subsets, return words and bifix codes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the fractal properties of the boundary of the Cantorval connected with Guthrie-Nymann's series. In particular, we prove that such a Cantorval can be represented as a union of open intervals and a Cantor set having zero Lebesgue measure and a fractional Hausdorff dimension. Moreover, we extend the result to a countable family of Cantorvals with a similar structure.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dynamical systems as zero-noise limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamical system may be defined by a simple transition law - such as a map or a vector field. The objective of most learning techniques is to reconstruct this dynamic transition law. This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. One of the major theoretical challenges for numerical methods is that approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as the zero-noise limit of a Markov process. The Markov process approximation is completely data-driven. Besides proving a low-noise approximation of the dynamics the process also approximates the invariant set, via the support of its stationary measures. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions, we show that the technique performs a convergent statistical approximation as well as approximations of true orbits.</description>

      <title>Algebraic dependence number and cardinality of generating iterated function systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a dust-like self-similar set (generated by IFSs with the strong separation condition), Elekes, Keleti and M\'{a}th\'{e} found an invariant, called `algebraic dependence number', by considering its generating IFSs and isometry invariant self-similar measures. We find an intrinsic quantitative characterisation of this number: it is the dimension over $\mathbb{Q}$ of the vector space generated by the logarithms of all the common ratios of infinite geometric sequences in the gap length set, minus 1. With this concept, we present a lower bound on the cardinality of generating IFS (with or without separation conditions) in terms of the gap lengths of a dust-like set. We also establish analogous result for dust-like graph-directed attractors on complete metric spaces. This is a new application of the ratio analysis method and the gap sequence.</description>

      <title>Sharp density discrepancy for cut and project sets: An approach via lattice point counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cut and project sets are obtained by taking an irrational slice of a lattice and projecting it to a lower dimensional subspace, and are fully characterised by the shape of the slice (window) and the choice of the lattice. In this context we seek to quantify fluctuations from the asymptotics for point counts. We obtain uniform upper bounds on the discrepancy depending on the diophantine properties of the lattice as well as universal lower bounds on the average of the discrepancy. In an appendix, Michael Bj\"orklund and Tobias Hartnick obtain lower bounds on the $L^2$-norm of the discrepancy also depending on the diophantine class; these lower bounds match our uniform upper bounds and both are therefore sharp. Using the sufficient criteria of Burago--Kleiner and Aliste-Prieto--Coronel--Gambaudo we find an explicit full-measure class of cut and project sets that are biLipschitz equivalent to lattices; the lower bounds on the variance indicate that this is the largest class of cut and project sets for which those sufficient criteria can apply.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a three-timescale framework for modelling climate change and introduce a space-heterogeneous one-dimensional energy balance model. This model, addressing temperature fluctuations from rising carbon dioxide levels and the super-greenhouse effect in tropical regions, fits within the setting of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations. Our results show how both mean and variance of temperature increase, without the system going through a bifurcation point. This study aims to advance the conceptual understanding of the extreme weather events frequency increase due to climate change.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization for random scattering zippers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a proof of dynamical localization for a random scattering zipper model. The scattering zipper operator is the product of two unitary by blocks operators, multiplicatively perturbed on the left and right by random unitary phases. One of the operator is shifted so that this configuration produces a random 5-diagonal unitary operator per blocks. To prove the dynamical localization for this operator, we use the method of fractional moments. We first prove the continuity and strict positivity of the Lyapunov exponents in an annulus around the unit circle, which leads to the exponential decay of a power of the norm of the products of transfer matrices. We then establish an explicit formula of the coefficients of the finite resolvent in terms of the coefficients of the transfer matrices using Schur's complement. From this we deduce, through two reduction results, the exponential decay of the resolvent, from which we get the dynamical localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that shift equivalence of essential adjacency matrices coincides with gauge-equivariant homotopy equivalence of their stabilized graph C*-algebras. This provide the first equivalent formulation of shift equivalence of essential matrices in terms of gauge actions on graph C*-algebras. Our proof uses bicategory theory for C*-bimodules developed by Meyer and Sehnem, allowing us to avoid the use of K-theory classification of C*-algebras.</description>
