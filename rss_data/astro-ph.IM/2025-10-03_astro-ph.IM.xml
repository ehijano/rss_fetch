      <title>Solar Hegemony: M-Dwarfs Are Unlikely to Host Observers Such as Ourselves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With no firm evidence for life beyond our solar system, inferences about the population observers such as ourselves rests upon the Earth as a single input, at least for now. Whilst the narrative of our home as a 'humdrum' system has become ingrained in the public psyche via Sagan, there are at least two striking facts about our existence which we know are certainly unusual. First, the stelliferous period spans ~10Tyr - yet here we are living in the first 0.1% of that volume. Second, over three-quarters of all stars are low-mass M-dwarfs, stars with no shortage of rocky habitable-zone planets - and yet, again, our existence defies this trend, previously dubbed the Red Sky Paradox. Two plausible resolutions are that a) stars below a certain mass, $M_{crit}$, do not produce observers, and, b) planets have a truncated temporal window for observers, $T_{win}$, negating the longevity advantage of M-dwarfs. We develop a Bayesian model that encompasses both datums and jointly explores the two resolutions covariantly. Our analysis reveals that 1) the hypothesis that these observations are mere luck is disfavored with an overwhelming Bayes factor of ~1600; 2) some truncation of low-mass stars is indispensable, lowering $T_{win}$ alone cannot well-explain the observations; and, 3) the most conservative limit on $M_{crit}$ occurs when fixing $T_{win}=10$Gyr, yielding $M_{crit}&gt;0.34 M_{\odot}$ [$0.74 M_{\odot}$] to 2$\sigma$ [1$\sigma$]. Our work challenges the tacit assumption of M-dwarfs being viable seats for observers and, indirectly, even life.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the development of Cherenkov Telescope Array control software with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop AI agents based on instruction-finetuned large language models (LLMs) to assist in the engineering and operation of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) Control and Data Acquisition Software (ACADA). These agents align with project-specific documentation and codebases, understand contextual information, interact with external APIs, and communicate with users in natural language. We present our progress in integrating these features into CTAO pipelines for operations and offline data analysis.</description>

      <title>Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs II: Milestones for binary characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the recent evidence for a gravitational wave (GW) background found by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, the next major science milestone is resolving individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The detection of these systems could arise via searches using a power-based GW anisotropy model or a deterministic template model. In Schult et al. 2025, we compared the efficacy of these models in constraining the GW signal from a single SMBHB using realistic, near-future PTA datasets, and found that the full-signal deterministic continuous wave (CW) search may achieve detection and characterization first. Here, we continue our analyses using only the CW model given its better performance, focusing now on characterization milestones. We examine the order in which CW parameters are constrained as PTA data are accumulated and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) grows. We also study how these parameter constraints vary across sources of different sky locations and GW frequencies. We find that the GW frequency and strain are generally constrained at the same time (or S/N), closely followed by the sky location, and later the chirp mass (if the source is highly evolving) and inclination angle. At fixed S/N, sources at higher frequencies generally achieve better precision on the GW frequency, chirp mass, and sky location. The time (and S/N) at which the signal becomes constrained is dependent on the sky location and frequency of the source, with the effects of pulsar terms and PTA geometry playing crucial roles in source detection and localization.</description>

      <title>Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs I: Model efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising targets for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is identifying an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) out of the population of binaries theorized to produce a gravitational wave background (GWB). In this work, we emulate an evolving PTA dataset, complete with an increasing number of pulsars and timing baseline, into which we inject a single binary on top of a Gaussian GWB signal. We vary the binary's source parameters, including sky position and frequency, and create an ensemble of simulated datasets with which we assess current Bayesian binary search techniques. We apply two waveform-based template models and a frequency-resolved anisotropy search to these simulations to understand how they compare in their detection and characterization abilities. We find that a template-based search including the full gravitational-wave signal structure (i.e., both Earth and pulsar effects of an incident GW) returns the highest Bayes Factors (BF), exceeding our estimator's capabilities by (S/N)~9-19, and has the most robust parameter estimation. Our anisotropy model attains a realization-median BF&gt;10 at 7&lt;(S/N)&lt;15. Interestingly, despite being a deterministic model, the Earth-term template struggles to detect and characterize low-frequency binaries (5 nHz). These binaries require higher (S/N)~16-19 to reach the same BF threshold. This is likely due to neglected confusion effects between the pulsar and Earth terms. By contrast, the frequency-resolved anisotropy model shows promise for parameter estimation despite treating a binary's GW signal as excess directional GW power without phase modeling. Sky location and frequency parameter constraints returned by the anisotropy model are only surpassed by the Earth term template model at (S/N)~12-13. Milestones for a first detection using the full-signal GW model are included in a companion paper (Petrov et al. 2025).</description>

      <title>An improved algorithm for separating clock delays from ionospheric effects in radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Low-frequency radio observations are heavily impacted by the ionosphere, where dispersive delays can outpace even instrumental clock offsets, posing a serious calibration challenge. Especially below 100 MHz, phase unwrapping difficulties and higher-order dispersion effects can complicate the separation of ionospheric and clock delays. Aims: We address this challenge by introducing a method for reliably separating clock delays from ionospheric effects, even under mediocre to poor ionospheric conditions encountered near solar maximum. Methods: The approach employs a key technique: we modelled our likelihood space using the circular Gaussian distribution (von Mises random variable) rather than non-circular distributions that suffer from $2\pi$ phase ambiguities. This ensures that noisier data are weighted less heavily than cleaner data during the fitting process. Results: The method reliably separates clock delays and ionospheric terms that vary smoothly in time whilst providing a good fit to the data. A comparison with the clock-ionosphere separation approach used in standard LOFAR data processing shows that our technique achieves significant improvements. In contrast to the old algorithm, which often fails to return reliable results below 100 MHz even under good ionospheric conditions, the new algorithm consistently provides reliable solutions across a wider range of conditions. Conclusions: This new algorithm represents a significant advance for large-scale surveys, offering a more dependable way to study ionospheric effects and furthering research in ionospheric science and low-frequency radio astronomy.</description>

      <title>Advancing Interstellar Science: A Global Framework for Comprehensive Study of Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) marks a transformative moment in humanity's capacity to detect and characterize interstellar objects (ISOs). With projections indicating an increase from a few detections per decade to potentially one every few months, humanity stands at the threshold of unprecedented scientific opportunity offering revolutionary insights into the nature of rocky materials, building blocks of life and technological products from other star systems. This white paper proposes the establishment of the United Nations Committee on Interstellar Objects (UNCIO), a specialized body designed to coordinate global scientific research, maximize observational coverage, and ensure optimal scientific return from these extraordinary objects from outside the solar system through systematic investigation in cosmochemistry, astrobiology, planetary sciences, fundamental physics, advanced technologies and materials science. The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in our current international infrastructure: the absence of coordinated detection, classification and intercept capabilities, insufficient protocols for rapid scientific response and international policy decisions to time-sensitive observations, and the need for effective science communication to maintain government and public support for these ambitious investigations and global threats to Earth. Drawing from successful international collaborations in areas such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), UNCIO would operate through a dual structure: an executive board for time-critical scientific decisions and an expanded committee for comprehensive stakeholder representation. This initiative is not merely aspirational but urgently practical.</description>

      <title>cuHPX: GPU-Accelerated Differentiable Spherical Harmonic Transforms on HEALPix Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization) is a widely adopted spherical grid system in astrophysics, cosmology, and Earth sciences. Its equal-area, iso-latitude structure makes it particularly well-suited for large-scale data analysis on the sphere. However, implementing high-performance spherical harmonic transforms (SHTs) on HEALPix grids remains challenging due to irregular pixel geometry, latitude-dependent alignments, and the demands for high-resolution transforms at scale. In this work, we present cuHPX, an optimized CUDA library that provides functionality for spherical harmonic analysis and related utilities on HEALPix grids. Beyond delivering substantial performance improvements, cuHPX ensures high numerical accuracy, analytic gradients for integration with deep learning frameworks, out-of-core memory-efficient optimization, and flexible regridding between HEALPix, equiangular, and other common spherical grid formats. Through evaluation, we show that cuHPX achieves rapid spectral convergence and delivers over 20 times speedup compared to existing libraries, while maintaining numerical consistency. By combining accuracy, scalability, and differentiability, cuHPX enables a broad range of applications in climate science, astrophysics, and machine learning, effectively bridging optimized GPU kernels with scientific workflows.</description>

      <title>Cross-Polarization Reduction in Kinetic Inductance Detectors Based on Quasi-Lumped Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) have emerged as a leading technology for millimeter- and submillimeter-wave astronomy due to their high sensitivity, natural multiplexing capabilities and scalable fabrication. In polarization-sensitive applications-such as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) studies-cross-polarization, or unintended response to the orthogonal polarization, poses a significant limitation to measurement fidelity. This work investigates the origin of cross-polarization in meandered Lumped Element KIDs (LEKIDs), with particular emphasis on the role of parasitic currents in the interdigitated capacitor. A comparative study between conventional LEKIDs and a quasi-lumped resonator design is presented, demonstrating that removing the capacitive element may improve cross-polarization discrimination, confirming the capacitor's contribution to polarization leakage.</description>

      <title>Design and Scientific Prospects of the POLAR-2 Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The POLAR-2 mission consists of 3 instruments designed with the combined aim of producing a deeper understanding of Gamma-Ray Bursts. To achieve this, POLAR-2 relies on polarisation measurements and, for the first time will provide these using 2 separate polarimeter detectors. The first of these is a payload optimised to perform Compton polarimetry measurements in the 40-1000 keV energy range using a combination of plastic scintillators and SiPMs. The development of this payload, the design of which is based on lessons learned from the POLAR mission, included optimization of plastic scintillator design. In addition, its development included detailed characterization, space qualification and radiation damage and mitigation strategies for the large number of silicon photo-multipliers included in the design. We will present these along with an overview of the readout electronics. These electronics were developed with flexibility in mind, as well as low cost and low power consumption. As such, its design is of interest beyond this polarimeter and is also used on the spectrometer instrument of POLAR-2 where it is used to read out an array of GAGG:Ce scintillators. This readout, in combination with a coded mask, allows this secondary instrument to provide detailed spectral and localization measurements. The final instrument used in the mission aims to use gas-based detectors to perform polarization measurements in the keV energy region. The novelty of this design is that it will be optimized to use these for wide field of view observations. The combination of the three instruments will allow to perform detailed spectral, localization and polarization measurements of these transient phenomena together for the first time. Here we provide an overview of the technologies employed in the mission along with detailed predictions on its capabilities after its launch currently foreseen in 2027.</description>

      <title>Reducing Simulation Dependence in Neutrino Telescopes with Masked Point Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data, this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.</description>

      <title>PRESOL: a web-based computational setting for feature-based flare forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares are the most explosive phenomena in the solar system and the main trigger of the events' chain that starts from Coronal Mass Ejections and leads to geomagnetic storms with possible impacts on the infrastructures at Earth. Data-driven solar flare forecasting relies on either deep learning approaches, which are operationally promising but with a low explainability degree, or machine learning algorithms, which can provide information on the physical descriptors that mostly impact the prediction. This paper describes a web-based technological platform for the execution of a computational pipeline of feature-based machine learning methods that provide predictions of the flare occurrence, feature ranking information, and assessment of the prediction performances.</description>

      <title>Dark characterization of Ti/Al LEKIDs for the search of axions in the W-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the electrical (dark) characterization of lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) fabricated from a Titanium/Aluminum bilayer and designed for broadband absorption in the W-band (75-110 GHz). These detectors are prototypes for future QCD axion search experiments within the Canfranc Axion Detection Experiment (CADEx), which demand sub 1e-19 W/Hz^0.5 sensitivities under low optical backgrounds. We combine a Mattis-Bardeen analysis to the temperature dependence of the detector parameters with noise spectroscopy to determine the electrical noise equivalent power (NEP). The minimum measured value for the electrical NEP is 3e-19 W/Hz0.5. Across the measured temperature range, we find that quasiparticle lifetime deviates from the expected BCS recombination law. Our analysis suggests that non-equilibrium relaxation is governed by spatial inhomogeneities in the superconducting gap and phonon diffusion effects. This work sets the road-map to achieve suitable and ultra-sensitive detectors in the W-band for dark matter axion search experiments.</description>

      <title>Model Evaluation of a Transformable CubeSat for Nonholonomic Attitude Reorientation Using a Drop Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a design for a drop tower test to evaluate a numerical model for a structurally reconfigurable spacecraft with actuatable joints, referred to as a transformable spacecraft. A mock-up robot for a 3U-sized transformable spacecraft is designed to fit in a limited time and space of the microgravity environment available in the drop tower. The robot performs agile reorientation, referred to as nonholonomic attitude control, by actuating joints in a particular manner. To adapt to the very short duration of microgravity in the drop tower test, a successive joint actuation maneuver is optimized to maximize the amount of attitude reorientation within the time constraint. The robot records the angular velocity history of all four bodies, and the data is analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model. We confirm that the constructed numerical model sufficiently replicates the robot's motion and show that the post-experiment model corrections further improve the accuracy of the numerical simulations. Finally, the difference between this drop tower test and the actual orbit demonstration is discussed to show the prospect.</description>

Abstract: The optical spectra of Titan reveal a rich set of absorption features, most of which are likely associated with methane (CH$_4$). Methane is a key molecule in planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, yet a comprehensive high-resolution linelist at optical wavelengths remains incomplete. This study identified and characterized potential CH$_4$ absorption features in high-resolution optical spectra of Titan, providing essential data for linelist development and improving CH$_4$ detection and characterization. We analyzed Titan spectra from the ESPRESSO spectrograph (R $\approx$ 190,000), identifying intrinsic features and measuring their relative strengths. A conservative detection approach was employed, slightly overestimating solar and telluric contributions to distinguish them from Titan's intrinsic features. To assess the impact of spectral resolution, we compared the ESPRESSO data with Titan UVES data (R $\approx$ 110,000). We identified 6,195 absorption features in the ESPRESSO spectra potentially associated with CH$_4$, of which 5,436 are newly reported. ESPRESSO detected twice as many features as UVES in overlapping regions, highlighting the advantage of higher-resolution data. Most detected lines remained unresolved, so our reported features are primarily blended absorption structures. We estimated the detection limit for feature identification to correspond to a CH$_4$ absorption coefficient of approximately 0.02 km-am$^{-1}$. Comparison of our results with a previous analysis of Titan UVES spectra and with experimental CH$_4$ data at a similar temperature showed good agreement, while some discrepancies were observed when compared with data acquired at a different temperature. We provide a comprehensive list of Titan absorption features with key reliability metrics, along with Titan's intrinsic spectra, to support future studies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic curl -- Features and convergence of the vorticity power spectrum in $N$-body simulations</title>

Abstract: Observations of the cosmic velocity field could become an important cosmological probe in the near future. To take advantage of future velocity-flow surveys we must however have the theoretical predictions under control. In many respects, the velocity field is easier to simulate than the density field because it is less severely affected by small-scale clustering. Therefore, as we also show in this paper, a particle-mesh (PM) based simulation approach is usually sufficient, yielding results within a few percent of a corresponding P$^3$M simulation in which short-range forces are properly accounted for, but which also carry a much larger computational cost.
  However, in other respects the velocity field is much more challenging to deal with than the density field: Interpolating the velocity field onto a grid is significantly more complicated, and the vorticity field (the curl-part of the velocity field) is severely affected by both sample variance and discretisation effects. While the former can be dealt with using fixed amplitude initial conditions, the former makes it infeasible to run fully converged simulations in a cosmological volume. However, using the $N$-body code CONCEPT we show that one can robustly extrapolate the cosmic vorticity power spectrum from just 4 simulations with different number of particles. We expect our extrapolated vorticity power spectra to be correct within 5\% of the fully converged result across three orders of magnitude in $k$. Finally, we have also investigated the time dependence of the vorticity as well as the ratio of vorticity to divergence.</description>

      <title>The Future of Artificial Intelligence and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (AI+MPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS), which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains (Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics) can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of AI+MPS.</description>
