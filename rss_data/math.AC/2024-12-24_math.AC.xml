      <title>On torsion-free modules and semi-hereditary rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of semi-hereditary rings is an important class of rings in theories that do not assume the Noetherian condition, such as perfectoid ring theory. We prove several results concerning the structure theory of this class, focusing on the relationship between semi-hereditary rings and the flatness of torsion-free modules. We also consider Shimomoto's problem concerning the flatness of the Frobenius map.</description>

      <title>Ideal transition systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17320v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This semi-expository article presents an inductive method of computing initial ideals and Gr\"obner bases for families of ideals in a polynomial ring. This method starts from a given set of pairs $(I,J)$ where $I$ is any ideal and $J$ is a monomial ideal contained in the initial ideal of $I$. These containments become a system of equalities if one can establish a particular transition recurrence among the chosen ideals. We describe explicit constructions of such systems in two motivating cases -- namely, for the ideals of matrix Schubert varieties and their skew-symmetric analogues. Despite many formal similarities with these examples, for the symmetric versions of matrix Schubert varieties, it is an open problem to construct the same kind of transition system. We present several conjectures that would follow from such a construction, while also discussing the special obstructions arising in the symmetric case.</description>

Abstract: Let F:K be a Galois extension of number fields and Q a prime ideal of O_F lying over the prime P of O_K. By analyzing the Q-adic closure of O_K in O_F we characterize those rings of integers O_K for which every residue class ring of Int(O_K) modulo a non-zero prime ideal is GE2 (meaning that every unimodular pair can be trasformed to (1,0) by a series of elementary transformations).</description>

      <title>Constant power maps on Hardy fields and transseries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{T}$ be the differential field of logarithmic-exponential transseries. We consider the expansion of $\mathbb{T}$ by the binary map that sends a real number $r$ and a positive transseries $f$ to the transseries $f^r$. Building on recent work of Aschenbrenner, van den Dries, and van der Hoeven, we show that this expansion is model complete, and we give an axiomatization of the theory of this expansion that is effective relative to the theory of the real exponential field. We show that maximal Hardy fields, equipped with the same map $(f,r)\mapsto f^r$, enjoy the same theory as $\mathbb{T}$, and we use this to establish a transfer theorem between Hardy fields and transseries.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart Functions of Weighted Lattice Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies three different ways to assign weights to the lattice points of a convex polytope and discusses the algebraic and combinatorial properties of the resulting weighted Ehrhart functions and their generating functions and associated rings. These will be called $q$-weighted, $r$-weighted, and $s$-weighted Ehrhart functions, respectively. The key questions we investigate are \emph{When are the weighted Ehrhart series rational functions and which classical Ehrhart theory properties are preserved? And, when are the abstract formal power series the Hilbert series of Ehrhart rings of some polytope?} We prove generalizations about weighted Ehrhart $h^*$-coefficients of $q$-weighted Ehrhart series, and show $q$- and $s$-weighted Ehrhart reciprocity theorems. Then, we show the $q$- and $r$-weighted Ehrhart rings are the (classical) Ehrhart rings of weight lifting polytopes.</description>

      <title>Representation-theoretic properties of balanced big Cohen-Macaulay modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.04508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(R, \m, k)$ be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring. In this paper, we assign a numerical invariant, for any balanced big Cohen-Macaulay module, called $\uh$-length. Among other results, it is proved that, for a given balanced big Cohen-Macaulay $R$-module $M$ with an $\m$-primary cohomological annihilator, if there is a bound on the $\uh$-length of all modules appearing in $\CM$-support of $M$, then it is fully decomposable, i.e. it is a direct sum of finitely generated modules. While the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture fails in general by a counterexample of Dieterich dealing with multiplicities to measure the size of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, our formalism establishes the validity of the conjecture for complete Cohen-Macaulay local rings. In addition, the pure-semisimplicity of a subcategory of balanced big Cohen-Macaulay modules is settled. Namely, it is shown that $R$ is of finite $\CM$-type if and only if the category of all fully decomposable balanced big Cohen-Macaulay modules is closed under kernels of epimorphisms. Finally, we examine the mentioned results in the context of Cohen-Macaulay artin algebras admitting a dualizing bimodule $\omega$, as defined by Auslander and Reiten. It will turn out that, $\omega$-Gorenstein projective modules with bounded $\CM$-support are fully decomposable. In particular, a Cohen-Macaulay algebra $\Lambda$ is of finite $\CM$-type if and only if every $\omega$-Gorenstein projective module is of finite $\CM$-type, which generalizes a result of Chen for Gorenstein algebras. Our main tool in the proof of results is Gabriel-Roiter (co)measure, an invariant assigned to modules of finite length, and defined by Gabriel and Ringel. This, in fact, provides an application of the Gabriel-Roiter (co)measure in the category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules.</description>

      <title>Rationality for arbitrary closure operations and the test ideal of full extended plus closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the notion of F-rationality to other closure operations, inspired by the work of Smith, Epstein and Schwede, and Ma and Schwede, which describe F-rationality in terms of the canonical module and top local cohomology module. We give conditions for a closure operation cl on a Cohen-Macaulay complete local ring under which cl-rationality is equivalent to parameter ideals being cl-closed. We also demonstrate that full extended plus closure as defined by Heitmann and weak full extended plus closure as defined by the first named author have no big test elements.</description>

      <title>On the natural nullcones of the symplectic and general linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a group acting on a polynomial ring S over a field K by degree-preserving K-algebra automorphisms. Several key properties of the invariant ring can be deduced by studying the nullcone of the action, that is, the vanishing locus of all non-constant homogeneous invariant polynomials. These properties include the finite generation of the invariant ring and the purity of its embedding in S. In this article, we study the nullcones arising from the natural actions of the symplectic and general linear groups.
  For the natural representation of the symplectic group (via copies of the regular representation), the invariant ring is a generic Pfaffian ring. We show that the nullcone of this embedding is F-regular in positive characteristic. Independent of characteristic, we give a complete description of the divisor class group of the nullcone and determine precisely when it is Gorenstein.
  For the natural representation of the general linear group (via copies of the regular representation and copies of its dual), the invariant ring is a generic determinantal ring. The nullcone of this embedding is typically non-equidimensional; its irreducible components are the varieties of complexes introduced by Buchsbaum and Eisenbud. We show that each of these irreducible components are F-regular in positive characteristic. We also show that the Frobenius splittings of the varieties of complexes may be chosen compatibly so that the nullcone is F-pure.</description>

      <title>Commuting Exponential maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of arbitrary characteristic. We introduce the notion of commuting exponential maps and formulate the commuting exponential maps conjecture. We show that the weak Abhyankar-Sathaye conjecture is equivalent to the commuting exponential maps conjecture. In particular, we prove that the commuting derivations conjecture $CD(3)$ is true for any field of zero characteristic. We also prove the following results related to ring of invariants of an exponential map of a polynomial ring.
  (1) Let $B=k^{[3]}$ and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}(B)$ be non-trivial. If the plinth ideal $\mathrm{pl} (\delta)$ contains a quasi-basic element, then the ring of invariants ($B^{\delta}$) is $k^{[2]}$.
  (2) Let $B=R^{[n]}$, where $R$ is a $k$-domain and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}_R(B)$ is a triangular exponential map. Then $B^{\delta}$ is non-rigid. In particular, for any field $k$ of zero characteristic the kernel of any triangular $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.
  (3) Let $k$ be a field of zero characteristic and $R$ be a $k$-domain. Then the kernel of any linear locally nilpotent $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.</description>

      <title>Goldbach theorems for group semidomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semidomain is a subsemiring of an integral domain. We call a semidomain $S$ additively reduced if $0$ is the only invertible element of the monoid $(S, +)$, while we say that $S$ is additively Furstenberg if every non-invertible element of $(S,+)$ can be expressed as the sum of an atom and an element of $S$. In this paper, we study a variant of the Goldbach conjecture within the framework of group semidomains $S[G]$ and group series semidomains $S[\![G]\!]$, where $S$ is both an additively reduced and additively Furstenberg semidomain and $G$ is a torsion-free abelian group. In particular, we show that every non-constant polynomial expression in $S[G]$ can be written as the sum of at most two irreducibles if and only if the condition $\mathscr{A}_+(S) = S^\times$ holds.</description>

      <title>The Multiplicity of Powers of a Class of Non-Square-free Monomial Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R = \mathbb{K}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ be a polynomial ring over a field $\mathbb{K}$, and let $I \subseteq R$ be a monomial ideal of height $h$. We provide a formula for the multiplicity of the powers of $I$ when all the primary ideals of height $h$ in the irredundant reduced primary decomposition of $I$ are irreducible. This is a generalization of \cite[Theorem 1.1]{TV}. Furthermore, we present a formula for the multiplicity of powers of special powers of monomial ideals that satisfy the aforementioned conditions. Here, for an integer $m&gt;0$, the $m$-th special power of a monomial ideal refers to the ideal generated by the $m$-th powers of all its minimal generators. Finally, we explicitly provide a formula for the multiplicity of powers of special powers of edge ideals of vertex-weighted oriented graphs.</description>

      <title>Gapfree graphs and powers of edge ideals with linear quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $I(G)$ be the edge ideal of a gapfree graph $G$. An open conjecture of Nevo and Peeva states that $I(G)^q$ has linear resolution for $q\gg 0$. We present a promising approach to this challenging conjecture by investigating the stronger property of linear quotients. Specifically, we make the conjecture that if $I(G)^q$ has linear quotients for some integer $q\geq 1$, then $I(G)^{s}$ has linear quotients for all $s\geq q$. We give a partial solution to this conjecture, and identify conditions under which only finitely many powers need to be checked. It is known that if $G$ does not contain a cricket, a diamond, or a $C_4$, then $I(G)^q$ has linear resolution for $q \geq 2$. We construct a family of gapfree graphs $G$ containing cricket, diamond, $C_4$ together with $C_5$ as induced subgraphs of $G$ for which $I(G)^q$ has linear quotients for $q \ge 2$.</description>
