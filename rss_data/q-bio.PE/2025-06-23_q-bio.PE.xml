      <title>Modeling and Inferring Metacommunity Dynamics with Maximum Caliber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge for community ecology is to use distribution patterns to infer basic parameters of dynamical models without conducting laborious experimental manipulations. We present a novel framework drawn from statistical physics -- Maximum Caliber -- for characterizing the temporal dynamics of complex ecological systems in spatially extended landscapes and inferring parameters from temporal data. As an extension of Maximum Entropy modeling, Maximum Caliber models the probability of possible trajectories of a stochastic system, rather than focusing on system states. We demonstrate the ability of the Maximum Caliber framework to capture ecological processes ranging from near- to far- from-equilibrium, using an array of species interaction motifs including random interactions, apparent competition, intraguild competition, and non-transitive competition, along with dispersal among multiple patches. For spatio-temporal data of species occurrence in a metacommunity, the parameters of a Maximum Caliber model can be estimated through a simple logistic regression to reveal migration rates between patches, magnitudes of interactions between species, and effects of intrinsic local environmental suitabilities. We test the accuracy of the method over a range of system sizes and time periods, and find that these parameters can be estimated without bias. We introduce entropy production as a system-level measure of disequilibrium, and use ``pseudo-$R^2$'' to characterize the predictability of the system. We show that our model can predict the dynamics of metacommunities much better than steady state models, when the system is far from equilibrium. The capacity to estimate basic parameters of dynamical metacommunity models from spatio-temporal data represents an important breakthrough for the study of metacommunities with application to practical problems in conservation and restoration ecology.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Rationality: An Evolutionary Game Theory of Perceptually Rational Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how biological organisms make decisions is of fundamental importance in understanding behavior. Such an understanding within evolutionary game theory so far has been sought by appealing to bounded rationality. Here, we present a perceptual rationality framework in the context of group cooperative interactions, where individuals make rational decisions based on their evolvable perception of the environment. We show that a simple public goods game accounts for power law distributed perceptual diversity. Incorporating the evolution of social information use into the framework reveals that rational decision-making is a natural root of the evolution of consistent personality differences and power-law distributed behavioral diversity. The behavioral diversity, core to the perceptual rationality approach, can lead to ever-shifting polymorphism or cyclic dynamics, through which different rational personality types coexist and engage in mutualistic, complementary, or competitive and exploitative relationships. This polymorphism can lead to non-monotonic evolution as external environmental conditions change. The framework provides predictions consistent with some large-scale eco-evolutionary patterns and illustrates how the evolution of social structure can modify large-scale eco-evolutionary patterns. Furthermore, consistent with most empirical evidence and in contrast to most theoretical predictions, our work suggests diversity is often detrimental to public good provision, especially in strong social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Ecological Measures Of Functional Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding functional diversity, the range and variability of species' roles and actions within their communities, is key to predicting and preserving the functions that sustain both nature and human well-being. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on functional diversity measurement. We begin by consolidating essential criteria that effective measures of functional diversity should meet. We then evaluate fifteen widely used functional diversity metrics against these criteria and assess their performance across six synthetic ecosystem scenarios where optimal behavior is known. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that none of the widely used metrics fully satisfy all the established requirements, and all fail in at least one ecosystem scenario. In particular, we find that almost all metrics flagrantly violate set monotonicity and distance monotonicity, requirements that adding a novel species should increase diversity, and that the magnitude of that increase should grow with trait dissimilarity. We also find that metrics fail to decline when rare, functionally extreme species are lost, and even increase when a perfectly redundant species is added. These critical flaws leave them blind to the very biodiversity loss that functional diversity measures are intended to detect. Our findings underscore the urgent need to develop a new generation of functional diversity metrics that more accurately reflect ecological realities.</description>

      <title>Six Decades Post-Discovery of Taylor's Power Law: From Ecological and Statistical Universality, Through Prime Number Distributions and Tipping-Point Signals, to Heterogeneity and Stability of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First discovered by L. R. Taylor (1961, Nature), Taylor's Power Law (TPL) correlates the mean (M) population abundances and the corresponding variances (V) across a set of insect populations using a power function (V=aM^b). TPL has demonstrated its 'universality' across numerous fields of sciences, social sciences, and humanities. This universality has inspired two main prongs of exploration: one from mathematicians and statisticians, who might instinctively respond with a convergence theorem similar to the central limit theorem of the Gaussian distribution, and another from biologists, ecologists, physicists, etc., who are more interested in potential underlying ecological or organizational mechanisms. Over the past six decades, TPL studies have produced a punctuated landscape with three relatively distinct periods (1960s-1980s; 1990s-2000s, and 2010s-2020s) across the two prongs of abstract and physical worlds. Eight themes have been identified and reviewed on this landscape, including population spatial aggregation and ecological mechanisms, TPL and skewed statistical distributions, mathematical/statistical mechanisms of TPL, sample vs. population TPL, population stability, synchrony, and early warning signals for tipping points, TPL on complex networks, TPL in macrobiomes, and in microbiomes. Three future research directions including fostering reciprocal interactions between the two prongs, heterogeneity measuring, and exploration in the context of evolution. The significance of TPL research includes practically, population fluctuations captured by TPL are relevant for agriculture, forestry, fishery, wildlife-conservation, epidemiology, tumor heterogeneity, earthquakes, social inequality, stock illiquidity, financial stability, tipping point events, etc.; theoretically, TPL is one form of power laws, which are related to phase transitions, universality, scale-invariance, etc.</description>

      <title>Perfect phylogenies via the Minimum Uncovering Branching problem: efficiently solvable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new efficiently solvable cases of the Minimum Uncovering Branching problem, an optimization problem with applications in cancer genomics introduced by Hujdurovi\'c, Husi\'c, Milani\v{c}, Rizzi, and Tomescu in 2018. The problem involves a family of finite sets, and the goal is to map each non-maximal set to exactly one set that contains it, minimizing the sum of uncovered elements across all sets in the family. Hujdurovi\'c et al. formulated the problem in terms of branchings of the digraph formed by the proper set inclusion relation on the input sets and studied the problem complexity based on properties of the corresponding partially ordered set, in particular, with respect to its height and width, defined respectively as the maximum cardinality of a chain and an antichain. They showed that the problem is APX-complete for instances of bounded height and that a constant-factor approximation algorithm exists for instances of bounded width, but left the exact complexity for bounded-width instances open. In this paper, we answer this question by proving that the problem is solvable in polynomial time. We derive this result by examining the structural properties of optimal solutions and reducing the problem to computing maximum matchings in bipartite graphs and maximum weight antichains in partially ordered sets. We also introduce a new polynomially computable lower bound and identify another condition for polynomial-time solvability.</description>

      <title>Finite size scaling of survival statistics in metapopulation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial metapopulation models are fundamental to theoretical ecology, enabling to study how landscape structure influences global species dynamics. Traditional models, including recent generalizations, often rely on the deterministic limit of stochastic processes, assuming large population sizes. However, stochasticity - arising from dispersal events and population fluctuations - profoundly shapes ecological dynamics. In this work, we extend the classical metapopulation framework to account for finite populations, examining the impact of stochasticity on species persistence and dynamics. Specifically, we analyze how the limited capacity of local habitats influences survival, deriving analytical expressions for the finite-size scaling of the survival probability near the critical transition between survival and extinction. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deterministic metapopulation capacity plays a fundamental role in the statistics of survival probability and extinction time moments. These results provide a robust foundation for integrating demographic stochasticity into classical metapopulation models and their extensions.</description>

      <title>Flexible inference of evolutionary accumulation dynamics using uncertain observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting evolutionary accumulation pathways is a key objective in many fields of research, ranging from classical evolutionary biology to diverse applications in medicine. In this context, we are often confronted with the problem that data is sparse and uncertain. To use the available data as best as possible, inference approaches that can handle this uncertainty are required. One way that allows us to use not only cross-sectional data, but also phylogenetic related and longitudinal data, is using `hypercubic inference' models. In this article we introduce HyperLAU, a new algorithm for hypercubic inference that makes it possible to use datasets including uncertainties for learning evolutionary pathways. Expanding the flexibility of accumulation modelling, HyperLAU allows us to infer dynamic pathways and interactions between features, even when large sets of particular features are unobserved across the source dataset. We show that HyperLAU is able to highlight the main pathways found by other tools, even when up to 50% of the features in the input data are uncertain. Additionally, we demonstrate how it can help to overcome possible biases that can occur then reducing the used data by excluding uncertain parts. We illustrate the approach with a case study on multidrug resistance in tuberculosis, showing that HyperLAU allows more flexible data and provides new information about evolutionary pathways compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Group centrality in optimal and suboptimal vaccination for epidemic models in contact networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of strategies that minimize the number of individuals needing vaccination to control an outbreak is a well-established area of study in mathematical epidemiology. However, for certain diseases, public policy tends to prioritize immunizing vulnerable individuals over epidemic control. As a result, optimal vaccination strategies may not always be effective in supporting real-world public policies. A similar situation happens when a new vaccine is introduced and is in short supply, as target priority groups for vaccination have to be defined. In this work, we focus on a disease that results in long-term immunity and spreads through a heterogeneous population, represented by a contact network. We study four well-known group centrality measures and show that the GED-Walk offers a reliable means of estimating the impact of vaccinating specific groups of individuals, even in suboptimal cases. Additionally, we depart from the search for target individuals to be vaccinated and provide proxies for identifying optimal groups for vaccination. While the GED-Walk is the most useful centrality measure for suboptimal cases, the betweenness (a related, but different centrality measure) stands out when looking for optimal groups. This indicates that optimal vaccination is not concerned with breaking the largest number of transmission routes, but interrupting geodesic ones.</description>

      <title>Failure and Success in Single-Drug Control of Antimicrobial Resistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical model of Antimicrobial Resistance in the host to predict the failure of two antagonists of bacterial growth: the immune response and a single-antibiotic therapy. After characterising the initial bacterial load that cannot be cleared by the immune system alone, we define the success set of initial conditions for which an infection-free equilibrium can be reached by a viable single-antibiotic therapy, and we provide a rigorously defined inner approximation of the set. For initial conditions within the success set, we propose an optimal control framework to design single-drug therapies.</description>

      <title>Drivers of cooperation in social dilemmas on higher-order networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding cooperation in social dilemmas requires models that capture the complexity of real-world interactions. While network frameworks have provided valuable insights to model the evolution of cooperation, they are unable to encode group interactions properly. Here, we introduce a general higher-order network framework for multi-player games on structured populations. Our model considers multi-dimensional strategies, based on the observation that social behaviours are affected by the size of the group interaction. We investigate dynamical and structural coupling between different orders of interactions, revealing the crucial role of nested multilevel interactions, and showing how such features can enhance cooperation beyond the limit of traditional models with uni-dimensional strategies. Our work identifies the key drivers promoting cooperative behaviour commonly observed in real-world group social dilemmas.</description>
