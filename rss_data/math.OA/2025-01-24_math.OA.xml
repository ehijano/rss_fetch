      <title>Synchronizing Dynamical Systems: Finitely presented systems and Ruelle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goals of the present paper are to determine the structure of the $C^\ast$-algebras associated to a finitely presented system and to develop the basic theory of the Ruelle algebras associated to a general synchronizing system. The later is related to the former in the sense that we show that Ruelle algebras associated to a finitely presented system are explicitly related to the Smale space case. Nevertheless, we give an example of a sofic shift where the Ruelle algebras are not Poincare dual (whereas this duality holds in the Smale space case). The relevant $C^\ast$-algebras are the synchronizing heteroclinic algebras that were introduced in our previous work on synchronizing systems. They are very much related to previous work of Thomsen, who in turn was building on work of Ruelle, Putnam, and Spielberg.</description>

      <title>Quantization of subgroups of the affine group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.01889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a locally compact group $G=Q\ltimes V$ such that $V$ is abelian and the action of $Q$ on the dual abelian group $\hat V$ has a free orbit of full measure. We show that such a group $G$ can be quantized in three equivalent ways: (1) by reflecting across the Galois object defined by the canonical irreducible representation of $G$ on $L^2(V)$; (2) by twisting the coproduct on the group von Neumann algebra of $G$ by a dual $2$-cocycle obtained from the $G$-equivariant Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of $V\times\hat V$; (3) by considering the bicrossed product defined by a matched pair of subgroups of $Q\ltimes\hat V$ both isomorphic to $Q$. In the simplest case of the $ax+b$ group over the reals, the dual cocycle in (2) is an analytic analogue of the Jordanian twist. It was first found by Stachura using different ideas. The equivalence of approaches (2) and (3) in this case implies that the quantum $ax+b$ group of Baaj-Skandalis is isomorphic to the quantum group defined by Stachura. Along the way we prove a number of results for arbitrary locally compact groups $G$. Using recent results of De Commer we show that a class of $G$-Galois objects is parametrized by certain cohomology classes in $H^2(G;\mathbb T)$. This extends results of Wassermann and Davydov in the finite group case. A new phenomenon is that already the unit class in $H^2(G;\mathbb T)$ can correspond to a nontrivial Galois object. Specifically, we show that any nontrivial locally compact group $G$ with group von Neumann algebra a factor of type I admits a canonical cohomology class of dual $2$-cocycles such that the corresponding quantization of $G$ is neither commutative nor cocommutative.</description>

      <title>The groupoid approach to equilibrium states on right LCM semigroup C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.03141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a right LCM semigroup $S$ and a homomorphism $N\colon S\to[1,+\infty)$, we use the groupoid approach to study the KMS$_\beta$-states on $C^*(S)$ with respect to the dynamics induced by $N$. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of KMS$_\beta$-states. As an application, we show that the sufficient condition for the uniqueness obtained for so-called generalized scales is necessary as well. Our most complete results are obtained for inverse temperatures $\beta$ at which the $\zeta$-function of $N$ is finite. In this case we get an explicit bijective correspondence between the KMS$_\beta$-states on $C^*(S)$ and the tracial states on $C^*(\operatorname{ker} N)$.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable designs and design-based shadow tomography from random lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate state designs for continuous-variable quantum systems using the aid of lattice-like quantum states. These are code states of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We show that for an n-mode system, the set of all GKP states forms a rigged continuous-variable state 2-design. We use these lattice state designs to construct a continuous variable shadow tomography protocol, derive sample complexity bounds for both global- and local GKP shadows under reasonable physical assumptions, and provide the physical gadgets needed to implement this protocol.</description>
