      <title>Learning a Filtered Backprojection Reconstruction Method for Photoacoustic Computed Tomography with Hemispherical Measurement Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In certain three-dimensional (3D) applications of photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), including \textit{in vivo} breast imaging, hemispherical measurement apertures that enclose the object within their convex hull are employed for data acquisition. Data acquired with such measurement geometries are referred to as \textit{half-scan} data, as only half of a complete spherical measurement aperture is employed. Although previous studies have demonstrated that half-scan data can uniquely and stably reconstruct the sought-after object, no closed-form reconstruction formula for use with half-scan data has been reported. To address this, a semi-analytic reconstruction method in the form of filtered backprojection (FBP), referred to as the half-scan FBP method, is developed in this work. Because the explicit form of the filtering operation in the half-scan FBP method is not currently known, a learning-based method is proposed to approximate it. The proposed method is systematically investigated by use of virtual imaging studies of 3D breast PACT that employ ensembles of numerical breast phantoms and a physics-based model of the data acquisition process. The method is subsequently applied to experimental data acquired in an \textit{in vivo} breast PACT study. The results confirm that the half-scan FBP method can accurately reconstruct 3D images from half-scan data. Importantly, because the sought-after inverse mapping is well-posed, the reconstruction method remains accurate even when applied to data that differ considerably from those employed to learn the filtering operation.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Passive Acoustic Mapping with the Cross-Correlated Angular Spectrum Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While passive acoustic mapping (PAM) has been advanced for monitoring acoustic cavitation activity in focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy, achieving both real-time and high-quality imaging capabilities is still challenging. The angular spectrum (AS) method presents the most efficient algorithm for PAM, but it suffers from artifacts and low resolution due to the diffraction pattern of the imaging array. Data-adaptive beamformers suppress artifacts well, but their overwhelming computational complexity, more than two orders of magnitude higher than the classical time exposure acoustic (TEA) method, hinders their application in real-time. In this work, we introduce the cross-correlated AS method to address the challenge. This method is based on cross-correlating the AS back-propagated wave fields, in the frequency domain, measured by different apodized sub-apertures of the transducer array to provide the normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) matrix for artifacts suppression. We observed that the spatial pattern of NCC matrix is variable which can be utilized by the triple apodization with cross-correlation (TAX) with AS scheme, namely the AS-TAX method, for optimal artifacts suppression outcomes. Both the phantom and mouse tumor experiments showed that: 1) the AS-TAX method has comparable image quality as the data-adaptive beamformers, reducing the energy spread area by 34.8-66.6% and improving image signal-to-noise ratio by 10.7-14.5 dB compared to TEA; 2) it reduces the computational complexity by two orders of magnitude compared to TEA allowing millisecond-level image reconstruction speed with a parallel implementation; 3) it can well map microbubble cavitation activity of different status (stable or inertial). The AS-TAX method represents a real-time approach to monitor cavitation-based FUS therapy with high image quality.</description>

      <title>PETAT -- An ASIC for Simple and Efficient Readout of Large PET Scanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern PET scanners based on scintillating crystals use solid state photo detectors for light readout. The small area of these devices is beneficial for spatial resolution, but also leads to a large number of electronic channels to be read out, mostly by application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) containing amplification, noise reduction, hit finding, time stamping and amplitude measurement. Although each ASIC provides up to $\approx 64$ channels, a large number of chips is required with the need for auxiliary electronic components like voltage regulators or FPGAs for control and data readout. The FPGAs in turn often require multiple supply voltages and configuration infrastructure, so that PCBs get complicated, cumbersome and power-hungry, in addition to the significant power requirement of the front-end ASICs. We address this issue in the latest generation of our PETA readout ASIC for SiPMs by a simplified control scheme and, in particular, by a hierarchical serial data readout which does not require any additional FPGA. In addition, it provides a time-sorted stream of hit data, allowing early on-detector data reduction and hit pre-processing like the removal of hits with no coincident partner. The simplicity of this readout facilitates a supply scheme where power/ground of multiple ASICs are connected in series instead of the standard parallel connection. This 'serial-powering' approach can reduce supply current (while increasing overall supply voltage) so that voltage drop issues in the supply are alleviated.</description>
