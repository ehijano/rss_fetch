      <title>Orbital Optical Raman Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom, which play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we propose an orbital optical Raman lattice to study exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which features a global topological chiral orbital current, and the two-dimensional spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns. The former has topological Bogoliubov excitations characterized by a uniform Chern number, while the spin-orbital supersolid phase hosts topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers which respectively protect the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our findings may inspire a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and shall also advance the experimental progress of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bloch Oscillations of a Soliton in a 1D Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of a quantum system subjected to an external force often defeats our classical intuition. A celebrated example is the dynamics of a single particle in a periodic potential, which undergoes Bloch oscillations under the action of a constant force. Surprisingly, Bloch-like oscillations can also occur in one-dimensional quantum fluids without requiring the presence of a lattice. The intriguing generalization of Bloch oscillations to a weakly-bounded ensemble of interacting particles has been so far limited to the experimental study of the two-particle case, where the observed period is halved compared to the single-particle case. In this work, we observe the oscillations of the position of a mesoscopic solitonic wave packet, consisting of approximately 1000 atoms in a one-dimensional Bose gas when subjected to a constant uniform force and in the absence of a lattice potential. The oscillation period scales inversely with the atom number, thus revealing its collective nature. We demonstrate the pivotal role of the phase coherence of the quantum bath in which the wave packet moves and investigate the underlying topology of the associated superfluid currents. Our measurements highlight the periodicity of the dispersion relation of collective excitations in one-dimensional quantum systems. We anticipate that our observation of such a macroscopic quantum phenomenon will inspire further studies on the crossover between classical and quantum laws of motion, such as exploring the role of dissipation, similarly to the textbook case of macroscopic quantum tunneling in Josephson physics.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Time Crystal in a Single-mode Nonlinear Cavity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I argue that a single driven quantum Van der Pol oscillator should not be considered a dissipative time crystal, contrary to previous claims. In particular, I show that its phase is prone to randomly drift when considering dephasing or additional nonlinearities, and hence its oscillations are not robust in that sense. The arguments I provide are applicable to many other models studied in the literature for which the limit of persistent oscillations coincides with the classical limit. I hope that this comment will spark a discussion about what should or should not be considered a time crystal (at least in the context of open quantum systems) and clarify it to a point.</description>

      <title>Negative refraction of light in an atomic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to manipulate light propagation in ways not possible with natural media has driven the development of artificially structured metamaterials. One of the most striking effects is negative refraction, where the light beam deflects away from the boundary normal. However, due to material characteristics, the applications of this phenomenon, such as lensing that surpasses the diffraction limit, have been constrained. Here, we demonstrate negative refraction of light in an atomic medium without the use of artificial metamaterials, employing essentially exact simulations of light propagation. High transmission negative refraction is achieved in atomic arrays for different level structures and lattice constants, within the scope of currently realised experimental systems. We introduce an intuitive description of negative refraction based on collective excitation bands, whose transverse group velocities are antiparallel to the excitation quasi-momenta. We also illustrate how this phenomenon is robust to lattice imperfections and can be significantly enhanced through subradiance.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-assisted preparation of topological boundary states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust states emerging at the boundaries of a system are an important hallmark of topological matter. Here, using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain as examples, we study the impact of a type of experimentally realizable bond dissipation on topological systems by calculating the steady-state density matrix, and demonstrate that such dissipation applied near the system boundary can assist in preparing topological edge states of the parent Hamiltonian, irrespective of the initial state or filling. This effect stems from the matching between the phase distribution encoded in the topological edge states and the target state prepared through bond dissipation. This work provides new insights into the preparation of topological edge states, particularly in the context of Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable active steering protocols for genuinely entangled state manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze an active steering protocol designed to target multipartite entangled states. The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected to weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback operations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme efficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold. Numerical simulations for systems with up to 20 qubits suggest that the protocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the system.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spectrum in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectra of particles in disordered lattices can either be completely extended or localized or can be intermediate which hosts both the localized and extended states separated from each other. In this work, however, we show that in the case of a one dimensional lattice with long-range hopping and non-Hermitian quasiperiodic onsite potential, the localized and extended states in the spectrum are intermixed with each other rather than well separated. As a result, an atypical intermediate phase appears where consecutive pairs of extended states intermittently appear in the pool of localized states. We also argue that such anomalous spectral intermixing can be realized in the short-range hopping limit by appropriate engineering of the onsite potential. Moreover, we obtain that the nature of the spectrum also reveals non-standard scenarios in the complex energy plane where the complex energies encircle real ones. These findings shed light on the intricate interplay between the non-Hermiticity and quasiperiodic disorder in the system.</description>

      <title>Third quantization with Hartree approximation for open-system bosonic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third quantization (3rd Q) for bosons provides the exact steady-state solution of the Lindblad equation with quadratic Hamiltonians. By decomposing the interaction of the Bose Hubbard model (BHM) according to Hartree approximation, we present a self-consistent formalism for solving the open-system bosonic Lindblad equation with weak interactions in the steady state. The 3rd Q with Hartree approximation takes into account the infinite Fock space of bosons while its demand of resource scales polynomially with the system size. We examine the method by analyzing three examples of the BHM, including the uniform chain, interaction induced diode effect, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hubbard model. When compared with the simulations with capped boson numbers for small systems, the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation captures the qualitative behavior and suggests an upper bound of the steady-state value. Finite-size scaling confirms the results from the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation converge towards the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the manageable method allows us to characterize and predict large-system behavior of quantum transport in interacting bosonic systems relevant to cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Distribution Function for $n \ge g$ Quantum Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new quantum mechanical distribution function $n^I(\varepsilon)$, is derived for the condition $n \ge g$, where in contrast to the exclusion principle $n \le g$ for fermions, each energy state must be populated by at least one particle. Although the particles share many features with bosons, the anomalous behavior of $n^I(\varepsilon)$ precludes Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) due to the required occupancy of the excited states, which creates a permanently pressurized background at $T=0$, similar to the degeneracy pressure of fermions. An exhaustive classification scheme is presented for both distinguishable and indistinguishable, particles and energy levels based on Richard Stanley's twelvefold way in combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of non-Fermi liquids sheds light on unconventional phenomena in condensed matter systems that lie beyond the scope of Landau Fermi liquid theory. One intriguing example is the Bose metal, characterized by an uncondensed bosonic ground state. However, constructing a Bose metal phase in two dimensions (2D) remains a significant challenge.} Utilizing constraint path quantum Monte Carlo and functional renormalization group methods on a fermionic system with spin anisotropy in a 2D lattice, we reveal the emergence of a Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) phase in a highly anisotropic regime ($\alpha &lt; 0.30$) with wide range of filling, as proposed in [A. E. Feiguin and M. P. A. Fisher, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 025303 (2009)]. Our findings exhibit a visible nonzero momentum Bose surface in the Cooper-pair distribution function, accompanied by a distinct signal of $d_{xy}$ correlation between pairs. Our results highlight that spin-dependent anisotropy in the Fermi surface leads to versatile pairing forms. Platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and recently proposed altermagnets hold promise for realizing this intriguing phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss many-body fermionic and bosonic systems subject to dissipative particle losses in arbitrary spatial dimensions $d$, within the Keldysh path-integral formulation of the quantum master equation. This open quantum dynamics represents a generalisation of classical reaction-diffusion dynamics to the quantum realm. We first show how initial conditions can be introduced in the Keldysh path integral via boundary terms. We then study binary annihilation reactions $A+A\to\emptyset$, for which we derive a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation. The ensuing algebraic decay in time for the particle density depends on the particle statistics. In order to model possible experimental implementations with cold atoms, for fermions in $d=1$ we further discuss inhomogeneous cases involving the presence of a trapping potential. In this context, we quantify the irreversibility of the dynamics studying the time evolution of the system entropy for different quenches of the trapping potential. We find that the system entropy features algebraic decay for confining quenches, while it saturates in deconfined scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model and numerical optimization of double Bragg diffraction, a widely used technique in atom interferometry. We derive an effective two-level-system Hamiltonian based on the Magnus expansion in the so-called "quasi-Bragg regime", where most Bragg-pulse atom interferometers operate. Furthermore, we extend the theory to a five-level description to account for Doppler detuning. Using these derived effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the impacts of AC-Stark shift and polarization errors on the double Bragg beam-splitter, along with their mitigations through detuning control. Notably, we design a linear detuning sweep that demonstrates robust efficiency exceeding 99.5% against polarization errors up to 8.5%. Moreover, we develop an artificial intelligence-aided optimal detuning control protocol, showcasing enhanced robustness against both polarization errors and Doppler effects. This protocol achieves an average efficiency of 99.92% for samples with a finite momentum width of 0.05$\hbar k_L$ within an extended polarization error range of up to 10%.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or on symmetry-forbidden transitions. Here, we observe quantized currents that survive the addition of bounded local disorder beyond the closing of the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. We explain the robustness using a local picture in \textit{configuration-space} based on Landau-Zener transitions, which rests on the Anderson localisation of the eigenstates. Moreover, we propose a protocol, directly realizable in for instance cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern numbers and opens new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac fields in an expanding universe: dynamical condensates and particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of particle production for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes is crucial to understand the large-scale structure of a universe from an inflationary epoch. In contrast to the free and fixed-background case, the production of particles with strong interactions and back reaction is not completely understood, especially in situations that require going beyond perturbation theory. In this work, we present advances in this direction by focusing on a self-interacting field theory of Dirac fermions in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By using a Hamiltonian lattice regularization with continuous conformal time and rescaled fields, this model becomes amenable to either a cold-atom analogue-gravity quantum simulation, or a dynamical variational approach. Leveraging a family of variational fermionic Gaussian states, we investigate how dynamical mass generation and the formation of fermion condensates associated to certain broken symmetries modify some well-known results of the free field theory. In particular, we study how the non-perturbative condensates arise and, more importantly, how their real-time evolution has an impact on particle production. Depending on the Hubble expansion rate, we find an interesting interplay of interactions and particle production, including a non-trivial back reaction on the condensates and a parity-breaking spectrum of produced particles.</description>
