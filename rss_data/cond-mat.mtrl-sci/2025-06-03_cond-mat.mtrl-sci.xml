      <title>Measuring the ferromagnetic resonance cone angle via static dipolar fields using diamond spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantitative measurement of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) precession cone angle of a micro-scale sample of vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE]$_{x\sim 2}$) using diamond spins. V[TCNE]$_{x\sim 2}$ is a low-damping, low-magnetization ferrimagnet with potential for scalable spintronics applications. Our study is motivated by the persistent need for quantitative metrology to accurately characterize magnetic dynamics and relaxation. Recently, diamond spins have emerged as sensitive probes of static and dynamic magnetic signals. Unlike analog sensors that require additional calibration, diamond spins respond to magnetic fields via a frequency shift that can be compared with frequency standards. We use a spin echo-based approach to measure the precession-induced change to the static stray dipolar field of a pair of V[TCNE]$_{x\sim 2}$ discs under FMR excitation. Using these stray dipolar field measurements and micromagnetic simulations, we extract the precession cone angle. Additionally, we quantitatively measure the microwave field amplitude using the same diamond spins, thus forming a quantitative link between drive and response. We find that our V[TCNE]$_{x\sim 2}$ sample can be driven to a cone angle of at least 6$^{\circ}$ with a microwave field amplitude of only 0.53 G. This work highlights the power of diamond spins for local, quantitative magnetic characterization.</description>

      <title>Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-ion implantation amorphization is an established approach to study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si). Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) has consistently observed Medium-Range Order (MRO) in this system that is not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model. Using this technique we find that the degree of MRO first increases on thermal annealing and then decreases before finally recrystallizing. We discuss this new result in the light of previous experimental studies and recent theoretical observations on the favorability of the paracrystalline (PC) model over the CRN in a-Si. At ion doses far above the minimum required to amorphize, a high defect density is found in the PC phase, which anneals out at 500oC. The PC structure after 500oC annealing is independent of the initial implantation conditions and appears to represent a metastable and highly-ordered structure. Higher-temperature annealing causes a reduction in the degree of MRO and the structure approaches but does not reach a fully continuous random network before eventually crystallizing above 600oC. The effect of high dose implantation is to increase the defect density in the as-implanted state and the annealing of these defects is likely responsible for the large characteristic heat evolution at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Low Spontaneous Brillouin Scattering in Anti-Resonant Hollow-Core Fibers in GHz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin light scattering (BLS) is a powerful experimental tool that can be used to get insights into the fundamental and applied properties of matter, like dispersions of quasiparticles in a solid, as well as their spatio-temporal dynamics. Many applications of light scattering favor the use of optical fibers in place of free-space optics. In this work, we compare the performance of anti-resonant hollow core fibers to that of conventional solid core fused silica fibers for BLS experiments in the GHz frequency range. Conventional fibers are barely suitable for low-noise measurements because of the spontaneous scattering of the photons on various phononic modes present in the core and cladding. In the case of the hollow-core fiber, we identify a range of discrete phononic modes and associate them with the various acoustic modes of the structure surrounding the hollow core using finite-element numerical simulations. The measured relative intensity of the spontaneous BLS signal from these modes is orders of magnitude smaller than that of a solid-core fiber, making anti-resonant hollow-core fibers one of the best solutions for the single-mode light guidance for BLS and potentially other low-noise photonic experiments.</description>

      <title>Influence of X-ray Irradiation on the Magnetic and Structural Properties of Gadolinium Silicide Nanoparticles for Self-Regulating Hyperthermia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hyperthermia treatment (MHT) utilizes heat generated from magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) under an alternating magnetic field (AMF) for therapeutic applications. Gadolinium silicide (Gd5Si4) has emerged as a promising MHT candidate due to its self-regulating heating properties and potential biocompatibility. However, the impact of high-dose X-ray irradiation on its magnetic behavior remains uncertain. This study examines Gd5Si4 nanoparticles exposed to 36 and 72 kGy X-ray irradiation at a high-dose rate (120 Gy/min). While X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy confirm no structural or compositional changes, transmission electron microscopy reveals localized lattice distortions, along with observable changes in magnetic properties, as evidenced in magnetization vs. temperature and hysteresis measurements. Despite this, magnetocaloric properties and specific loss power (SLP) remain unaffected. Our findings confirm the stability of Gd5Si4 under high-dose X-ray irradiation, supporting its potential for radiotherapy (RT) and magnetocaloric cooling in deep-space applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of terahertz pulse transmission through ferroelectric nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical model is developed to predict the temporal evolution of the lattice polarization in ferroelectric nanomembranes upon the excitation by a terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse of an arbitrary waveform, and the concurrent transmission of the THz pulse in both the linear and the nonlinear regimes. It involves the use of the perturbation method to solve the equation of motion for the lattice polarization in both unclamped and strained ferroelectric nanomembranes within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory. The model is applicable to perovskite oxides such as BaTiO3 and SrTiO3, wurtzite Al1-xScxN, and trigonal LiNbO3. Our analytical model provides a theoretical basis for determining the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of ferroelectric materials through THz transmission experiment. The calculation results also suggest an approach to reversing the chirality of a circularly polarized THz pulse by harnessing the resonant polarization-photon coupling in ferroelectrics. This capability of chirality reversal, along with the high tunability from a strain applied along any arbitrarily oriented in-plane axis, provides new opportunities for THz wave modulation without relying on complex metasurface designs.</description>

      <title>Huge anisotropic magneto-thermal switching in high-purity polycrystalline compensated metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-thermal transport is a promising physical property for thermal management applications. Magneto-thermal switching enables active control of heat flows, and a high switching ratio is desirable for improving performance. Here, we report on the observation of a huge magneto-thermal switching (MTS) effect in high-purity (5N) Pb polycrystalline wires, where magnetic fields perpendicular to the heat current direction are applied at low temperatures. At T = 3 K and B = 0.1 T, the measured thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of the Pb wire is about 2500 W m-1 K-1 but is reduced to ~150 and ~5 W m-1 K-1 at B = 1 and 9 T, respectively. This strong suppression is attributed to magnetoresistance in compensated metals. Although the huge magnetoresistance has been studied in single crystals with field along the selected orbitals, our results demonstrate that a huge MTS can similarly be realized even in flexible polycrystalline wires. This finding highlights the practical potential of magneto-thermal control in low-temperature thermal management, including applications in space environments where temperatures are around 3 K.</description>

      <title>Resonant interlayer coupling in NbSe$_2$-graphite epitaxial moir{\'e} superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir{\'e} heterostructures, created by stacking two-dimensional (2D) materials together with a finite lattice mismatch or rotational twist, represent a new frontier of designer quantum materials. Typically, however, this requires the painstaking manual assembly of heterostructures formed from exfoliated materials. Here, we observe clear spectroscopic signatures of moir{\'e} lattice formation in epitaxial heterostructures of monolayer (ML) NbSe$_2$ grown on graphite substrates. Our angle-resolved photoemission measurements and theoretical calculations of the resulting electronic structure reveal moir{\'e} replicas of the graphite $\pi$ states forming pairs of interlocking Dirac cones. Interestingly, these intersect the NbSe$_2$ Fermi surface at the $\mathbf{k}$-space locations where NbSe$_2$'s charge-density wave (CDW) gap is maximal in the bulk. This provides a natural route to understand the lack of CDW enhancement for ML-NbSe$_2$/graphene as compared to a more than four-fold enhancement for NbSe$_2$ on insulating support substrates, and opens new prospects for using moir{\'e} engineering for controlling the collective states of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Topological phase control in Mn1-xGexBi2Te4 via spin-orbit coupling and magnetic configuration engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological systems based on MnBi2Te4 have recently attracted significant attention due to their rich interplay between magnetism and topological electronic states. In this work, using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate topological phase transitions (TPTs) in Mn1-xGexBi2Te4 compounds with both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering under variations of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength and uniaxial strain along the c axis. We show that the emergence of a Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase requires the crossing of bands with opposite sz spin projections along the {\Gamma}Z direction. Modulation of SOC and strain can annihilate Weyl points via spin-selective hybridization, driving transitions into trivial or topological insulating phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that local asymmetry in Mn/Ge substitution, particularly at 37.5% Ge concentration (Mn0.625Ge0.375Bi2Te4) can locally disrupt AFM interlayer coupling and induce a WSM state even in globally AFM systems, without external remagnetization. To optimize Weyl point separation and enhance the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), we propose partial substitution of Mn by Fe and Te by Se.</description>

      <title>Magnetic interactions as a pivotal determinant in stabilizing a novel AgIIAgIIIF5 polymorph with high spin AgIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on theoretical calculations, we introduce a new AgIIAgIIIF5 monoclinic polymorph with a rare high spin AgIII. Our analysis of the experimental xray diffraction data available in the literature reveals that this polymorph was likely prepared in the past in a mixture with the triclinic form of the same compound. Theoretical calculations reproduce very well the lattice parameters of both forms. Calculations suggest that under ambient conditions, the monoclinic form is the more energetically stable phase of Ag2F5. We predict a strong one-dimensional antiferromagnetic superexchange between silver cations of different valences with superexchange constant of minus 207 meV (hybrid functional result). The polymorph with high spin AgIII owes its stability over the one with low spin AgIII, to these magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio Study of Structural, Magnetic, Optoelectronic and Thermo-Physical Properties of HoPdBi Half-Heusler Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this investigation, we have used the density functional theory (DFT) to investigate several aspects of the half-Heusler compound HoPdBi. The following properties have been studied: spin polarized electronic properties, magnetic moment, phonon dispersion with phonon density of states, structural, elastic properties, optical characteristics, and thermo-physical features. The calculated unit cell volume and ground-state lattice characteristics closely match the experimental results. This study is the first to examine the optoelectronic, thermo-physical, and elastic characteristics of HoPdBi. The mechanical stability requirements were met by the calculated elastic constants. The compound's ductility is shown by the estimated Pugh's ratio, Poisson's ratio, and Cauchy pressure. Band structures and electronic energy density of states have been evaluated in order to better understand the magnetic features with spin polarization. Band structure simulations were conducted with and without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect in order to look into any topological signature. The electrical band structure of the compound shows semi-metallic properties. The reflectivity, absorption coefficient, refractive index, dielectric function, optical conductivity, and loss function of this semi-metal have all been thoroughly examined. The compound is a good reflector in infrared region and a good absorber of ultraviolet (UV) light. This compound is a suitable candidate for high temperature applications and possesses potential as heat sink because of its high melting point and thermal conductivity. It is also suitable for spintronics applications. The majority of this study's findings are completely novel.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potassium-decorated graphenyldiene (K@GPD) is investigated as a promising two-dimensional material for reversible hydrogen storage using first-principles density functional theory calculations. Potassium atoms bind strongly to the GPD monolayer, and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations confirm the thermal stability of the functionalized system at 300 K. Hydrogen adsorption energies range from -0.11 to -0.14 eV per H$_2$, denoting reversible storage. At full coverage (18 H$_2$ molecules), the system reaches a storage capacity of 8.82 wt\%, exceeding the U.S. DOE target. AIMD simulations reveal spontaneous H$_2$ desorption at ambient temperature, demonstrating excellent reversibility.</description>

      <title>TPHE-Graphene: A First-Principles Study of a New 2D Carbon Allotrope for Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is essential for reducing global carbon emissions and addressing climate change. Developing advanced materials for efficient hydrogen storage enables sustainable energy solutions in this context. Herein, we propose sodium-decorated TPHE-graphene as a high-performance two-dimensional material for hydrogen storage. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that TPHE-graphene exhibits dynamical, thermal, energetic, and mechanical stability, as confirmed by cohesive energy, phonon dispersion, and molecular dynamics simulations. The monolayer displays metallic behavior and a high Young's modulus of 250.46 N/m. Upon sodium decoration, strong chemisorption occurs with a binding energy of -2.08 eV and minimal tendency for Na atom clustering. Hydrogen adsorption analysis reveals that each Na atom can bind up to five H$_2$ molecules, resulting in a gravimetric storage capacity of 9.52 wt\%. The calculated H$_2$ adsorption energies range from -0.22 eV to -0.18 eV, falling within the ideal range for reversible adsorption under ambient conditions. These findings highlight Na-decorated TPHE-graphene as a structurally robust and efficient hydrogen storage material well-suited for future green energy applications.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulation of the effects of neutron irradiation on Caesium Lead Bromide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of fast neutron reactors and nuclear fusion reactors, it is necessary to find new radiation-hardened high-flux core neutron detectors. The use of perovskite Caesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) for neutron radiation detection is a new research direction. However, at high temperatures, the effects of neutron radiation, especially the Primary Knock-out Atom (PKA) and Displacement Per Atom (DPA), and the defect distribution at the molecular level have not been reported. This study investigated the effect on CsPbBr$_3$ produced by 14 MeV neutron irradiation under 100 K to 400 K. Molecular dynamics methods are used to model the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms at the molecular level of materials. This study obtained the displacement threshold energies of three atoms in CsPbBr$_3$ and obtained the distribution of vacancies and interstitial atoms within the material over time. Monte Carlo simulations were used to obtain PKA and DPA information in CsPbBr$_3$ under neutron irradiation. This research will help to further study the performance changes of halide perovskites under neutron irradiation to verify the possibility of using them as radiation-hardened neutron detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials require high electronic conductivity and low thermal conductivity. CrN has been shown to have low phononic thermal conductivity, making it a potential candidate for thermoelectric applications. In addition, similarities have been observed between YN and ScN suggesting that the CrYN alloy may have interesting thermoelectric properties. As CrYN has not been studied in detail at the level of thermoelectric properties, the first study on CrYN alloy of Seebeck coefficient and zT figure of merit is proposed in this study. For this purpose, cubic special quasirandom structures were constructed at values of x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 in the alloy Cr_{1-x}Y_xN starting from different magnetic structures. After analyzing lattice parameters, Cr magnetic moments, octahedron deformation, second neighbors distribution around metals, density of states and band structures, it was concluded that to obtain high values of Seebeck coefficient and zT, it is necessary the presence of a pseudo gap in both spin channels and it is also necessary that the Fermi level is on a steep decreasing slope of number of states, since due to Motts approximation, the value of this slope is proportional to the Seebeck coefficient. Density of states of all the structures shows a metallic behavior. In structures with x=0.5, the presence of small indirect energy gaps is observed. Although no structure retains the initial magnetic configuration, there is a possible influence of this on the electronic structure. Considerable deformations in octahedra can suppress thermoelectric properties.</description>

      <title>Effect of crystallinity on the frictional and wear performance of molybdenum disulfide: A molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frictional and wear performance of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is significantly influenced by its intrinsic arrangement of crystals or crystallinity. In this study, we investigate the effect of crystallinty on coefficient of friction (COF) and wear in MoS2 using a suite of reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A range of configurations, from amorphous to crystalline, is modeled to capture the effect of structural order on the tribological behavior. To study friction and wear, we simulate the sliding of a spherical rigid carbon body over the MoS2 surface under varying crystallinity conditions. Our results reveal a pronounced reduction in COF with decreasing crystallinity, with crystalline MoS2 exhibiting superlubricity. This behavior is attributed to the preservation of a flat sliding surface and frictional anisotropy, which enables lateral movement along low-resistance paths. In contrast, amorphous and polycrystalline MoS2 with lower degrees of crystallinity displays a substantially higher COF, driven by increased surface roughness and atomic-scale energy dissipation. Furthermore, we examine the wear mechanisms under high normal loads, demonstrating that crystallinity enhances wear resistance by mitigating material deformation. These findings provide atomic-scale insights into the tribological performance of MoS2, emphasizing the critical role of structural order in achieving ultralow friction. Our work corroborates with previous studies on superlubricity in MoS2 and extends this understanding to rigid-body sliding conditions, offering valuable implications for designing low-friction and wear resistant solid lubricants.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency, High-Fidelity Charge Initialization of Shallow Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond exhibit long spin coherence times, optical initialization, and optical spin readout under ambient conditions, making them excellent quantum sensors. However, the conventional scheme for charge state initialization based on off-resonant green excitation results in significant state preparation errors, typically around 30%. One method for improving charge state initialization fidelity is to use multicolor excitation, which has been demonstrated to achieve a near-unity preparation fidelity for bulk NV centers by using a few milliseconds of near-infrared (5 mW) and green (10 {\mu}W) excitation. The translation of such schemes to NV centers near the diamond surface with higher efficiency optical pumping would enable myriad tasks in nanoscale sensing. Here, we demonstrate a protocol for efficient charge initialization of shallow NV centers between 5 nm and 15 nm from the diamond surface. By carefully studying the charge dynamics of shallow NV centers, we identify a region of parameter space that allows for near-unity (95%) charge initialization within 300 {\mu}s of near-infrared (1 mW) and green (10 {\mu}W) excitation. The time to 90% charge initialization can be as fast as 10 {\mu}s for 4 mW of near-infrared and 39 {\mu}W of green illumination. This fast, efficient charge initialization protocol will enable nanoscale sensing applications where state preparation errors currently prohibit scaling, such as measuring higher-order multi-point correlators.</description>

      <title>A Foundation Model for Non-Destructive Defect Identification from Vibrational Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects are ubiquitous in solids and strongly influence materials' mechanical and functional properties. However, non-destructive characterization and quantification of defects, especially when multiple types coexist, remain a long-standing challenge. Here we introduce DefectNet, a foundation machine learning model that predicts the chemical identity and concentration of substitutional point defects with multiple coexisting elements directly from vibrational spectra, specifically phonon density-of-states (PDoS). Trained on over 16,000 simulated spectra from 2,000 semiconductors, DefectNet employs a tailored attention mechanism to identify up to six distinct defect elements at concentrations ranging from 0.2% to 25%. The model generalizes well to unseen crystals across 56 elements and can be fine-tuned on experimental data. Validation using inelastic scattering measurements of SiGe alloys and MgB$_2$ superconductor demonstrates its accuracy and transferability. Our work establishes vibrational spectroscopy as a viable, non-destructive probe for point defect quantification in bulk materials, and highlights the promise of foundation models in data-driven defect engineering.</description>

      <title>Cubic BeB$_2$: A metastable $p$-type conductive material from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron forms a wide variety of compounds with alkaline earth elements due to its unique bonding characteristics. Among these, binary compounds of Be and B display particularly rich structural diversity, attributed to the small atomic size of Be. Cubic BeB$_2$ is a particularly interesting phase, where Be donates electrons to stabilize a diamond-like boron network under high pressure. In this work, we employ \textit{ab initio} methods to conduct a detailed investigation of cubic BeB$_2$ and its functional properties. We show that this metastable phase is dynamically stable under ambient conditions, and its lattice match to existing substrate materials suggests possible epitaxial stabilization via thin-film growth routes. Through a comprehensive characterization of its electronic, transport, and superconductivity properties, we demonstrate that cubic BeB$_2$ exhibits high hole concentrations and high hole mobility, making it a potential candidate for efficient $p$-type transport. In addition, cubic BeB$_2$ is found to exhibit low-temperature superconductivity at degenerate doping levels, similar to several other doped covalent semiconductors such as diamond, Si, and SiC.</description>

      <title>Anomalous magnetic response in the Au-Al-Gd 1/1 quasicrystal approximant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic response of the Tsai-type 1/1 Au-Al-Gd approximant crystals (ACs) was quantitatively investigated in terms of the magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{M}$) for different magnetic ground states. A comprehensive $\Delta S_{M}$ map over a wide electron concentration range has been established, demonstrating the detailed variation of $\Delta S_{M}$ across the entire magnetic phase diagram in the Tsai-type 1/1 ACs. Near the boundaries of the ferromagnetic (FM) phase, a clear deviation from the mean-field theory (MFT) was observed in both the Curie temperature ($T_{C}$) and magnetic field ($H$) dependences of the maximum magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{M}^{max}$). Contrary to general expectations, a high $\Delta S_{M}^{max}$ (7.2 J/K mol-Gd under a 5 T field variation), even comparable to those of candidate materials for low-temperature magnetic refrigeration, was obtained within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) region near the FM / AFM phase boundary. The unexpected enhancement of $\Delta S_{M}^{max}$ toward the AFM region under high magnetic fields indicates an anomalous magnetic response in the present Tsai-type 1/1 AC, which is presumably associated with the breakdown of the MFT. The present finding suggests that tuning the magnetic ground state across the phase boundary is an effective strategy to enhance $\Delta S_{M}$, even in general rare-earth intermetallic compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnetoelectricity was recently revealed as an emergent topic, which opens a unique route to precisely control magnetoelectric functionality. Here we report the synchronous magnetic-electric-cycle operation of topological magnetoelectric switching in GdMn2O5. Compared with pure magnetic-cycle operation, this topological winding can be accessed in a much broader parameter space, i.e. orientation of magnetic field is not limited to the magic angle and the effect can persist up to the Curie temperature. The fine tuning of free energy landscape is responsible to this topological behavior.</description>

      <title>Tunable Itinerant Ferromagnetism in the Two-Dimensional FePd$_2$Te$_2$ Hosting 1D Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) magnetism offers unidirectional spin interactions that allow unique tunable properties and unconventional spin phenomena. However, it often suffers from poor stability, limiting practical applications. In this regard, integrating 1D magnetism into two-dimensional (2D) materials enables a promising route to stabilize these systems while preserving their anisotropic magnetic characteristics. Here, we focus on the 2D ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$ (T$_C$ = 183K), which hosts 1D spin chains and strong in-plane anisotropy. Our first-principles calculations reveal highly anisotropic magnetic exchange interactions, confirming its 1D ferromagnetic nature. We modulate this behavior by Co and Ni substitution and introduce two new members of this family, CoPd$_2$Te$_2$ -- a ferromagnet -- and NiPd$_2$Te$_2$. Our results unveil the microscopic mechanisms governing the behaviour of FePd$_2$Te$_2$ and CoPd$_2$Te$_2$. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the variation of the chain length is key to modulate magnetism. Finally, we determine the magnon dispersion, showcasing a pronounced anisotropy that enables unidirectional magnon propagation.</description>

      <title>Direct determination of layer anomalous Hall conductivity using uniaxial Wannier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for computing layer anomalous Hall conductivity (LAHC) in real space by integrating the Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki method with hybrid Wannier functions localized along a single axis. To validate the method, we calculated the LAHC of axion-insulating MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and confirmed the agreement between the sum of LAHC on the surface and the surface AHC previously reported. We further applied the method to antiferromagnetic Mn$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$ and examined the dependence on the magnetic structure of LAHC, identifying cases with and without axion insulating behavior. This layer-resolved analysis offers a powerful tool for studying topological transport in complex materials, including heterostructures, and may guide the design of future devices based on the anomalous Hall effect with precise layer control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the fabrication and optimization of semi-transparent antimony sulfide (Sb$_2$S$_3$) thin-film solar cells in a superstrate configuration, using RF magnetron sputtering of metallic antimony followed by post-deposition sulfurization. The influence of absorber and buffer layer thicknesses on device performance was systematically studied in FTO/CdS/Sb$_2$S$_3$/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au architectures. Optimizing the Sb$_2$S$_3$ absorber thickness to 100 nm yielded a champion device with a power conversion efficiency of 2.76\%, short-circuit current density of 14 mA/cm$^2$, and open-circuit voltage of 650 mV. The devices exhibit up to 20\% transmittance in the 380--740 nm wavelength range, indicating their suitability for indoor and building-integrated photovoltaic applications. Structural and compositional analyses confirmed high-purity Sb$_2$S$_3$ (more than 90 at.\%) and improved crystallinity after sulfurization. These results demonstrate the potential of sputtered Sb$_2$S$_3$ as a scalable and tunable absorber for emerging transparent thin-film solar technologies and highlight the critical role of thickness optimization and interface control in device performance.</description>

      <title>Time inversion symmetry in the Dirac and Schr\"odinger-Pauli theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory is generally believed to give a faithful representation of the nonrelativistic and weakly relativistic limit of the Dirac theory. However, the Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory is fundamentally incomplete in its account of broken time inversion symmetry, e.g., in magnetically ordered systems. In the Dirac theory of the electron, magnetic order breaks time inversion symmetry even in the nonrelativistic limit, whereas time inversion symmetry is effectively preserved in the Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In the Dirac theory, the Berry curvature $1/(2m^2c^2)$ is thus an intrinsic property of nonrelativistic electrons similar to the well-known spin magnetic moment $e\hbar/(2m)$, while this result is missed by the nonrelativistic or weakly relativistic Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation. In ferromagnetically ordered systems, the intrinsic Berry curvature yields a contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity independent of spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Adsorbate phase transitions on nanoclusters from nested sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nested sampling was employed to investigate adsorption equilibria on the truncated-octahedral Lennard-Jones nanocluster LJ$_{38}$ while systematically varying adsorbate-surface well depth and Lennard-Jones size parameters. Evaluation of the canonical partition function over a wide temperature range identifies two successive phase transitions: (i) condensation of the gas phase onto the cluster surface at higher temperatures, and (ii) lateral rearrangement of the adsorbed layer at lower temperatures. For identical interactions, the condensate first populates both three- and four-fold hollow sites; when adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are weakened, preference shifts to the four-coordinated (100) sites. Size mismatch governs low-temperature behavior: smaller adsorbates aggregate to increase mutual contacts, whereas larger ones distribute more evenly to maximize coordination with the cluster. These findings highlight key trends in facet competition and lattice mismatch, and showcase nested sampling as an automated, unbiased tool for exploring surface configurational space and guiding investigations of more complex, realistic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Sliding Ferroelectrics Induced Hybrid-Order Topological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01402v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ferroelectric layer sliding as a new approach to realize and manipulate topological quantum states in two-dimensional (2D) bilayer magnetic van der Waals materials. We show that stacking monolayer ferromagnetic topological states into layer-spin-locked bilayer antiferromagnetic structures, and introducing sliding ferroelectricity leads to asynchronous topological evolution of different layers (spins) owing to existence of polarization potentials, thereby giving rise to rich layer-resolved topological phases. As a specific example, by means of a lattice model, we show that a bilayer magnetic 2D second order topological insulator (SOTI) reveals an unrecognized spin-hybrid-order topological insulator after undergoing ferroelectric sliding. Interestingly, in such phase, the spin-up (top layer) and spin-down (bottom layer) channels exhibit first-order and second-order topological properties, respectively. Moreover, other topological phases such as SOTI, quantum spin Hall insulator, quantum anomalous Hall insulator, and trivial insulator can also emerge through changes in the parameters of the system, and the relevant topological indices are also discussed. In terms of materials, based on first principles calculations, we predict material ScI2 can serve as an ideal platform to realize our proposal. Further, we predict that the anomalous Nernst effect of these several topological phases exhibits distinct differences, and therefore can be used as a signal for experimentally probing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskites with tunable and switchable polarization hold immense promise for unlocking novel functionalities. Using density-functional theory, we reveal that intrinsic defects can induce, enhance, and control polarization in non-ferroelectric perovskites, with SrTiO$_3$ as our model system. At high defect concentrations, these systems exhibit strong spontaneous polarization - comparable to that of conventional ferroelectrics. Crucially, this polarization is switchable, enabled by the inherent symmetry-equivalence of defect sites in SrTiO$_3$. Strikingly, polarization switching not only reverses the polarization direction and modulates its magnitude but also modifies the spatial distribution of localized defect states. This dynamic behavior points to unprecedented responses to external stimuli, opening new avenues for defect-engineered materials design.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Guided Discovery of Temperature-Induced Solid-Solid Phase Transitions in Inorganic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting solid-solid phase transitions remains a long-standing challenge in materials science. Solid-solid transformations underpin a wide range of functional properties critical to energy conversion, information storage, and thermal management technologies. However, their prediction is computationally intensive due to the need to account for finite-temperature effects. Here, we present an uncertainty-aware machine-learning-guided framework for high-throughput prediction of temperature-induced polymorphic phase transitions in inorganic crystals. By combining density functional theory calculations with graph-based neural networks trained to estimate vibrational free energies, we screened a curated dataset of approximately 50,000 inorganic compounds and identified over 2,000 potential solid-solid transitions within the technologically relevant temperature interval 300-600 K. Among our key findings, we uncover numerous phase transitions exhibiting large entropy changes (&gt; 300 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$), many of which occur near room temperature hence offering strong potential for solid-state cooling applications. We also identify $21$ compounds that exhibit substantial relative changes in lattice thermal conductivity (20-70%) across a phase transition, highlighting them as promising thermal switching materials. Validation against experimental observations and first-principles calculations supports the robustness and predictive power of our approach. Overall, this work establishes a scalable route to discover functional phase-change materials under realistic thermal conditions, and lays the foundation for future high-throughput studies leveraging generative models and expanding open-access materials databases.</description>

      <title>Tunable direct bandgap and optical response in \ch{Mo_{1-x}W_xS2} monolayer alloys: A first-principles investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic and optical properties of monolayer \ch{Mo_{1-x}W_xS2} alloys, systematically exploring the full compositional range ($x=0$ to $1$) using density functional theory (DFT). We establish that these alloys are thermodynamically stable and maintain the characteristic 2H crystal structure with minimal structural perturbation upon alloying. A key finding is the preservation of a direct bandgap at the $K$-point across all compositions. This gap exhibits continuous tunability, increasing near-monotonically from \SI{1.696}{\electronvolt} (\ch{MoS2}) to \SI{1.858}{\electronvolt} (\ch{WS2}), a critical feature for tailoring optoelectronic devices. Electronic structure analysis reveals the systematic evolution of the orbital contributions of transition metal $d$ and sulfur $p$ at the edges of the band with composition. Consequently, the optical spectra, evaluated up to \SI{8}{\electronvolt}, show a progressive blueshift in the main features of the interband transition with increasing \ch{W} content, accompanied by predictable changes in key optical constants. Our comprehensive results validate the monolayer \ch{Mo_{1-x} W_xS2} as an electronically versatile platform that offers fine control over electronic and optical properties via alloying, making these tunable direct-gap semiconductors highly promising for next-generation photodetectors, light emitters, and potentially flexible optoelectronic applications exploiting their 2D nature.</description>

      <title>Persistence of charge ordering instability to Coulomb engineering in the excitonic insulator candidate TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TiSe$_2$ has long been considered one of the best candidate materials to host the elusive excitonic insulator (EI) phase. However, a finite coupling to the lattice can generically be expected, while a lack of "smoking-gun" signatures for the importance of the electron-hole interaction in driving the phase transition has rendered it challenging to distinguish the EI from the conventional charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. Here, we demonstrate a new approach, exploiting the susceptibility of excitons to dielectric screening. We combine mechanical exfoliation with molecular-beam epitaxy to fabricate ultra-clean van der Waals heterostructures of monolayer (ML-)TiSe$_2$/graphite and ML-TiSe$_2$/hBN. We observe how the modified substrate screening environment drives a renormalisation of the quasi-particle band gap of the TiSe$_2$ layer, signifying its susceptibility to Coloumb engineering. The temperature-dependent evolution of its electronic structure, however, remains unaffected, indicating that excitons are not required to drive the CDW transition in TiSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Fully characterized linear magnetoelectric response of 2D monolayers from high-throughput first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01515v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We screen 4784 stable monolayers from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) and identify 57 ferromagnetic (FM) and 67 antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds that should exhibit linear magnetoelectric (ME) effects. Using density functional theory, we compute contributions from the spin and orbital angular momentum as well as lattice-mediated and clamped-ion analogs to fully characterize the linear ME tensor in the static limit. We observe a general trend that AFM ordering gives rise to a larger ME response compared to FM ordered monolayers. Using a typical van der Waals interlayer distance, we find that AFM $\mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{SI}_2$ exhibits the strongest component of linear ME response, providing approximately 580 ps/m. This is two orders of magnitude greater than in prototypical $\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ but comparable to the largest ME response measured in bulk $\mathrm{TbPO}_4$ (280-740 ps/m). We also search for antimagnetoelectricity and find a number of FM and AFM compounds with antiferroic tensor entries. By demonstration of select examples and analysis of our full data set, we argue that inclusion of all contributions (spin, orbital, lattice-mediated and clamped-ion) is of crucial importance for reliable predictions of the total ME response.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-driven modelling of amorphous and polycrystalline BaZrS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chalcogenide perovskite material BaZrS$_{3}$ is of growing interest for emerging thin-film photovoltaics. Here we show how machine-learning-driven modelling can be used to describe the material's amorphous precursor as well as polycrystalline structures with complex grain boundaries. Using a bespoke machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) model for BaZrS$_{3}$, we study the atomic-scale structure of the amorphous phase, quantify grain-boundary formation energies, and create realistic-scale polycrystalline structural models which can be compared to experimental data. Beyond BaZrS$_{3}$, our work exemplifies the increasingly central role of MLIPs in materials chemistry and marks a step towards realistic device-scale simulations of materials that are gaining momentum in the fields of photovoltaics and photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure reorganization in MPS3 via d-shell-selective alkali metal doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition-metal thiophosphates (MPS3) offer promising opportunities for spintronic applications due to their highly tunable electronic properties. While alloying and intercalation have been shown to modulate ground states, the role of d-shell filling in governing these transitions remains insufficiently understood. Here, we investigate electron doping effects in MPS3 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT+U). Lithium and cesium deposition are employed to induce doping across different MPS3 compounds. We identify two distinct doping mechanisms: in MnPS3, electrons are primarily donated to the P2S6 ligand clusters, with negligible Mn 2p core-level shifts and no major changes in the valence band. In contrast, FePS3, CoPS3, and NiPS3 exhibit clear reductions in transition-metal oxidation states, with a 1.0 eV reduction in spin-orbit splitting for Co upon doping. ARPES on CoPS3 reveals a 400 meV shift of Co-derived bands towards higher binding energies and new dispersive states up to 1 eV above the valence band maximum, indicating metallic behavior. These results establish a direct correlation between d-shell filling and doping response, highlighting alkali metal doping as a tunable route to tailor the electronic and magnetic properties of 2D AFM semiconductors for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the hybrid piezo and pyroelectric nanogenerators performance by SiO2 nanowires confinement in poly(vinylidene fluoride)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of a novel flexible piezo/pyro-electric nanogenerator (PPNG) that combines a uniform film of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) infiltrated over vertically supported SiO2 nanowires (NWs) to enhance both piezoelectric and pyroelectric energy harvesting capabilities. The synthetic procedure involves a low-temperature multi-step approach, including the soft-template formation of SiO2 NWs on a flexible substrate, followed by the infiltration of a PVDF thin film (TF). The plasma-enabled fabrication of SiO2 NWs facilitated vertical alignment and precise control over the surface microstructure, density, and thickness of the confined nanostructures. These strategic structural systems promote the development of the most favourable electroactive \b{eta}- and {\gamma}-phases in the PVDF matrix. Notably, the electrical poling plays a major role in aligning the random dipoles of the PVDF macromolecular chain in a more ordered fashion to nucleate the amplified electroactive phases. As a proof-of-concept, the fabricated PPNG exhibited a significant improvement in the instantaneous piezoelectric output power density (P), ~ 9-fold amplification relative to its bare PVDF TF counterpart. Analogously, the pyroelectric coefficient (p) demonstrated a 4-fold superior performance with referenced PVDF TF based PPNG. Thus, the engineered system of SiO2 NWs@PVDF comprising PPNG offers a promising pathway toward multisource energy harvesting capabilities through efficient energy transduction at mechanical excitation frequencies of 10-12 Hz and across a temperature difference ({\Delta}T) of 9 to 22 K.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Data Scarcity in Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique for imaging surfaces with atomic resolution, providing insight into physical and chemical processes at the level of single atoms and molecules. A regular task of STM image analysis is the identification and labelling of features of interest against a uniform background. Performing this manually is a labour-intensive task, requiring significant human effort. To reduce this burden, we propose an automated approach to the segmentation of STM images that uses both few-shot learning and unsupervised learning. Our technique offers greater flexibility compared to previous supervised methods; it removes the requirement for large manually annotated datasets and is thus easier to adapt to an unseen surface while still maintaining a high accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using it to recognise atomic features on three distinct surfaces: Si(001), Ge(001), and TiO$_2$(110), including adsorbed AsH$_3$ molecules on the silicon and germanium surfaces. Our model exhibits strong generalisation capabilities, and following initial training, can be adapted to unseen surfaces with as few as one additional labelled data point. This work is a significant step towards efficient and material-agnostic, automatic segmentation of STM images.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Modulation of Spin Splitting and Persistent Spin Textures in Low-Symmetry 2D Hybrid Perovskites: A case study of RP phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of a persistent spin texture (PST) in pseudo-2D hybrid perovskite, characterized by significant spin splitting strength on the order of \(3 \, \text{eV} \cdot \text{\AA}\). Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, complemented by a \(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}\) model analysis, we validate the presence of PST and its robustness under various conditions. The material's non-centrosymmetric nature and strong spin-orbit coupling ensure uniform spin orientation in momentum space, enabling long spin lifetimes and promising spintronic applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of the spin splitting via the application of external strain and stress, offering a versatile approach to control spin configurations. Our results highlight the potential of this perovskite system for next-generation spintronic devices, where external perturbations can be used to precisely modulate electronic properties.</description>

Abstract: We present Gibbs free-energy phase diagrams for compressed iron within a pressure range of 20 to 300 GPa and electronic temperature up to 3 eV obtained using finite-temperature density functional and density functional perturbation theories. Our results for bcc, fcc, and hcp phases predict solid-solid phase transitions in iron driven purely by electronic entropy and temperature. We found a phase transition from hcp to bcc at pressures above 200 GPa, which depends on the electronic temperature. An experimental observation of the stability of the bcc phase above 200 GPa by X-ray Free Electron Laser has recently been reported.</description>

      <title>Inductive-Effect-Driven Tunability of Magnetism and Lumines-cence in Triangular Layers ANd(SO4)2 (A = Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning the energy landscape of manybody electronic states in extended solids through the inductive effect-a concept widely used in organic chemistry-offers a new, effective strategy for materials development. Here, we demonstrate this approach using the ANd(SO4)2 (A = Rb, Cs) model system, which possesses different A-site electronegativity and displays a distorted triangular lattice of Nd3+ (4I9/2 ground term). Magnetization data indicate appreciable antiferromagnetic interactions without long-range ordering down to 1.8 K while highlighting the tunable population of the electronic states. Temperature-dependent and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that emissions and nonradiative processes can be modified by the inductive effect at the atomic level. Heat capacity data confirm no magnetic ordering and add insight into the role of phonons in emission lifetime. Density functional theory calculations prove enhanced covalency in the Cs compound compared to the Rb counterpart while acknowledging the adjustable magnetic intralayer and inter-layer exchange pathways. These results demonstrate a viable framework for utilizing the inductive effect as an important knob for simultaneously dialing in magnetic, optical, and electronic properties in quantum materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently emerged as a new class of magnetic materials sharing properties of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets. Despite very small net magnetization, they show phenomena usually associated with ferromagnetism, such as the Faraday, Kerr and Anomalous Hall effects, resulting from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling, as well as the spin splitting of electron bands and Spin Hall Effect of non-relativistic origin. Spin space groups and magnetic multipoles are used to explain symmetry properties of altermagnets. Here, I show that the conventional phenomenological description in terms of a vector antiferromagnetic order parameter can be applied to all effects observed in altermagnets with collinear and non-collinear spin orders. I also discuss non-relativistic effects in non-altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced structural disordering and anomalous pressure-volume behaviour in high-entropy zirconates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ambient-temperature high-pressure behaviour of (La0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Gd0.2Yb0.2)2Zr2O7 zirconate (HEZ) nanopowders with three different average particle sizes (~25nm, ~45 nm and ~ 68nm) were studied using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) measurements up to ~30 GPa. Smaller particle-size HEZ nanopowder (~25 nm), synthesized at the lower sintering temperature, exhibits pure defect-fluorite (DF) phase, whereas larger particle-size HEZ nanopowders (~45nm and ~68nm), synthesized at the higher sintering temperature, exhibit mixture of DF and pyrochlore phase (PY). The phase fraction of the PY phase increases with sintering temperature and hence with the particle size. All the HEZ nanopowders exhibit stability of initial structures (DF and PY) up to ~ 30 GPa, though phase fraction of PY phase in larger particle-size HEZ nanopowders successively reduces with pressure which is concomitant with significant variation in ox48f fractional coordinate in PY phase. Both the phases in all the studied samples exhibit anomalous pressure-volume (P-V) behaviour between ~7 to 15 GPa. The anomaly decreases with increasing particle size of HEZ nanopowders. The variation of bond lengths and polyhedron volume with pressure suggests that the anomalous P-V behaviour and structural changes at high pressures are primarily due to the distortion of the polyhedrons in DF and PY structures in HEZ nanopowders.</description>

      <title>Proximity-Induced Rashba Spin-Orbit Interaction in BaMnO$_\text{3}|$KTaO$_\text{3}$ Heterostructure for Antiferromagnetic Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of Rashba-like spin-orbit interaction in the antiferromagnetic BaMnO$_3|$KTaO$_3$ oxide heterostructure using density functional theory (DFT). The analysis of our charge transfer model based on electrostatic potential reveals a type-I band alignment and establishes the conditions under which the interface becomes conducting. Our calculations uncover pronounced linear Rashba splitting ($\alpha_{(1)}$ = 0.114~eV\AA) in Mn 3$d$ bands near the Fermi level, induced by proximity to Ta 5$d$ orbitals of the KTO substrate. The heterostructure exhibits inversion asymmetry due to polar discontinuities at its $p$-type and $n$-type interfaces. Using three-dimensional band dispersions and projected spin textures along with isoenergetic contours obtained from DFT calculations, we confirm the linear Rashba nature of the spin-orbit coupling. Employing Monte Carlo simulations based on DFT-derived magnetic exchange interactions, we estimate a N\'{e}el temperature of approximately $\sim 54 \mathrm{~K}$. Our results demonstrate a viable route to engineering strong spin-orbit coupling in centrosymmetric antiferromagnets for spintronics applications.</description>

Abstract: Administration of pulmonary surfactant is crucial for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of Curosurf atomization via the Endosurf device, a recently developed spray technology, as a promising approach for surfactant delivery in infants with RDS. A comprehensive analysis was performed to evaluate the physicochemical properties of atomized Curosurf, including its surface tension and rheology. The size distribution of Curosurf vesicles was also investigated. An ex vivo respiratory model based on rabbit lungs breathing through an instrumented hypobaric chamber representing the thorax of a preterm infant was developed to provide proof of concept for regional aerosol deposition of atomized Curosurf. The atomization of Curosurf with the innovative Endosurf device did not significantly alter surface tension, but reduced vesicle size and promoted homogeneous distribution of Curosurf in the lungs. Rheological measurements showed the viscoelastic complexity of atomized Curosurf. This preliminary study confirmed the promising potential of Curosurf atomization via the Endosurf device for the distribution of surfactant in the lungs of infants with RDS. These advances could help to improve the treatment of RDS in preterm infants and offer new perspectives for healthcare professionals and affected families.</description>

      <title>MOFGPT: Generative Design of Metal-Organic Frameworks using Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the immense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional computational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at scale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging data-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of MOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates both opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To address these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced, transformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our approach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both connectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline comprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid sequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via property-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into sequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable, topologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work demonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with reinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and unlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Hamiltonian Compiler for Hybrid Qubit-Boson Processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of the interactions of fermions and bosons -- the fundamental particles of nature -- is essential for modeling complex quantum systems in material science, chemistry and high-energy physics and has been proposed as a promising application of fermion-boson quantum computers, which overcome the overhead encountered in mapping fermions and bosons to qubits. However, compiling the simulation of specific fermion-boson Hamiltonians into the natively available fermion-boson gate set is challenging. In particular, the large local dimension of bosons renders matrix-based compilation methods, as used for qubits and in existing tools such as Bosonic Qiskit or OpenFermion, challenging. We overcome this issue by introducing a novel symbolic compiler based on matrix-free symbolic manipulation of second quantised Hamiltonians, which automates the decomposition of fermion-boson second quantized problems into qubit-boson instruction set architectures. This integration establishes a comprehensive pipeline for simulating quantum systems on emerging qubit-boson and fermion-boson hardware, paving the way for their large-scale usage.</description>

      <title>Beyond Atomic Geometry Representations in Materials Science: A Human-in-the-Loop Multimodal Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most materials science datasets are limited to atomic geometries (e.g., XYZ files), restricting their utility for multimodal learning and comprehensive data-centric analysis. These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets. The dataset and implementations are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/MultiCrystalSpectrumSet.</description>

      <title>Foundations of the ionization potential condition for localized electron removal in density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal tuning of functional parameters in density functional theory approximations, based on enforcing the ionization potential theorem, has emerged as the method of choice for the non-empirical prediction of the electronic structure of finite systems. This method has recently been extended to the bulk limit, based on an ansatz that generalizes the ionization potential theorem to the removal of an electron from a localized Wannier orbital. This Wannier-localization based optimal tuning method has been shown to be highly successful for a wide range of periodic systems, accurately predicting electronic and optical properties. However, a rigorous theoretical justification for its foundational ansatz has been lacking. Here, we establish an ionization potential condition for the removal of a localized electron, by extending the piecewise linearity and Janak's theorems in density functional theory. We also provide numerical evidence supporting our theory.</description>

      <title>Evidence for supramolecular dynamics of non-hydrogen bonding polar van der Waals liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-hydrogen bonding van der Waals liquids with dipole-dipole interactions are typically viewed as non-associative and not considered able to sustain large supramolecular structures. Combining broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) and rheology, we demonstrate the supramolecular formation in a group of non-hydrogen-bonding van der Waals liquids, i.e. 1-bromo-2-ethylhexane, 1-chloro-2-ethylhexane, and 1-bromo-3,7-dimethyloctane. BDS shows an emergence of a Debye-like process slower than their structural relaxation, which follows super-Arrhenius temperature dependence. Meanwhile, rheological measurements reveal a noticeable dynamical separation between the terminal relaxation and the structural rearrangements. Interestingly, the rheological terminal time agrees remarkably well with the dielectric Debye-like relaxation time, pointing to a strong coupling between the terminal flow and the supramolecular dynamics of these van der Waals liquids. These results highlight the role of intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions on the structure and slow dynamics of van der Waals liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phonon behavior of a Co-based honeycomb frustrated magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ under magnetic field applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The temperature and field dependence of the sound velocity and sound attenuation unveil prominent spin-lattice coupling in this material, promoting ultrasound as a sensitive probe for magnetic properties. An out-of-plane ferrimagnetic order is determined below the N\'eel temperature $T_N=27$~K. A comprehensive analysis of our data further provides strong evidence for a triple-Q ground state of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. Furthermore, the ultrasound data underscore that the field impact on the thermal conductivity as recently reported is of pure phononic origin.</description>

      <title>A Simple Iterative Approach for Constant Chemical Potential Simulations at Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical potential of species in solution is essential for understanding various chemical processes at interfaces. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, constrained by fixed compositions, cannot satisfy a constant chemical potential condition as solute species can migrate to the interface and deplete the bulk due to solute-interface interactions. In this study, we introduce a simple and computationally efficient approach named iterative constant chemical potential molecular dynamics (iCuMD) simulation, which helps simulate targeted molar concentrations of species in solution. iCuMD overcomes the limitations of conventional MD by adjusting the number of species in the solution to reach a target concentration (chemical potential). We demonstrate our approach using solid-liquid and liquid-air interfacial systems as case studies. Specifically, we perform classical force field-based MD simulations of NaCl(aq)-air and NaCl(aq)-graphite interfaces and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-based MD simulations of the Na2SO4(aq)-graphene interface. Our results show that the iCuMD approach efficiently achieves the desired bulk ion concentration within two iterations and can also be integrated with MLIP-driven simulations which enable constant potential simulations with DFT-level accuracy. We show that iCuMD offers a robust and simple computational framework for constant chemical potential simulations as its only requirement is to be able to converge interfacial simulations with a measurable bulk region.</description>

      <title>VO$_2$ oscillator circuits optimized for ultrafast, 100 MHz-range operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillating neural networks are promising candidates for a new computational paradigm, where complex optimization problems are solved by physics itself through the synchronization of coupled oscillating circuits. Nanoscale VO$_2$ Mott memristors are particularly promising building blocks for such oscillating neural networks. Until now, however, not only the maximum frequency of VO$_2$ oscillating neural networks, but also the maximum frequency of individual VO$_2$ oscillators has been severely limited, which has restricted their efficient and energy-saving use. In this paper, we show how the oscillating frequency can be increased by more than an order of magnitude into the 100 MHz range by optimizing the sample layout and circuit layout. In addition, the physical limiting factors of the oscillation frequencies are studied by investigating the switching dynamics. To this end, we investigate how much the set and reset times slow down under oscillator conditions compared to the fastest switching achieved with single dedicated pulses. These results pave the way towards the realization of ultra-fast and energy-efficient VO$_2$-based oscillating neural networks.</description>

      <title>Controlled Spherulitic Crystal Growth from Salt Mixtures: A Universal Mechanism for Complex Crystal Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherulites are complex polycrystalline structures that form through the self-assembly of small aggregated nanocrystals starting from a central point and growing radially outward. Despite their wide prevalence and relevance to fields ranging from geology to medicine, the dynamics of spherulitic crystallization and the conditions required for such growth remain ill-understood. Here, we report on the conditions to induce controlled spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate from evaporating aqueous solutions of sulfate salt mixtures at room temperature. We reveal that introducing divalent metal ions in the solution cause spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate. For the first time, we quantify the supersaturation at the onset of spherulitic growth from salt mixtures and determine the growth kinetics. Our results show that the nonclassical nucleation process induces the growth of sodium sulfate spherulites at high supersaturation in highly viscous solutions. The latter reaches approximately 111 Pa$\cdot$s, triggered by the divalent ions, at the onset of spherulite precipitation leading to a diffusion limited growth. We also show that spherulites, which are metastable structures formed under out-of-equilibrium conditions, can evolve into other shapes when supersaturation decreases as growth continues at different evaporation rates. These findings shed light on the conditions under which spherulites form and offer practical strategies for tuning their morphology.</description>

Abstract: The results of determination of critical magnetic fields, magnetization curves and critical currents of niobium samples of different purity are presented. It is shown that ultrapure niobium near Tc is a superconductor of the first type and becomes a superconductor of the second type with decreasing temperature due to the temperature dependence of the Ginzburg-Landau parameters. The dependence of the hysteresis of the magnetization curves of massive samples on the surface state is investigated. A comparison of the superconducting parameters with the parameters of the electron spectrum of niobium is carried out. The dependence of the critical current of niobium wires on the longitudinal magnetic field agrees with the assumption of a force-free current distribution.</description>

      <title>Micelle Forming Linear-Dendritic Block Copolymers: A Theoretical Comparison between Random Hyperbranched and Precise Dendrimer Polymer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbranched block copolymers offer a simpler and more efficient synthesis route compared to more traditional dendritic systems, while still providing exceptional control over surface functionality and self-assembly. This makes them ideal candidates for engineering nanoparticles with tailored properties for applications such as drug delivery and sensing. Here we use self-consistent field calculations to compare the micelle structures formed by copolymers with a polydisperse hyperbranched (LHBC), monodisperse dendritic (LDBC), and linear solvophilic blocks. Representative LHBC structures were generated by molecular dynamics simulations mimicking the slow-monomer addition protocol. We find that LHBC micelles are more stable, have a lower critical micelle concentration, and are better at accommodating larger drug payloads than LDBC micelles, and these properties further improve with increasing polydispersity. LHBC micelles also offer more terminal ends for functionalization than LDBC micelles for LDBCs with up to four branching generations, with the number of terminal ends being surprisingly independent of the LHBC polydispersity. Our findings highlight the superiority of LHBC micelles in flexibility and performance over LDBC micelles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that 2D gapped many-body quantum states are constrained by an infinite-dimensional symmetry which renders them transparent to weak disorder. This prevents disorder-induced localization when interactions are strong enough to open a gap. Using purely algebraic methods we derive all possible quantum states near the superconductor-to-insulator (SIT) transition and we compute the meson spectrum of superinsulators.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Neutron diffraction evidence of the 3-dimensional structure of Ba2MnTeO6 and misidentification of the triangular layers within the face-centred cubic lattice"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustrated magnetism continues to attract significant attention due to its potential to host novel quantum many-body phenomena and associated exotic excitations that transcend existing paradigms. Herein, we present our reply to the comment on our recent thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation studies on a frustrated double perovskite, Ba2MnTeO6 (henceforth BMTO). Previous studies by four independent groups, including our group, suggested a trigonal space group based on single-crystal and polycrystalline samples of BMTO, while the recent comment reports a cubic space group based on polycrystalline samples. We believe that the structure is fairly intricate because of the slight variations between the two space groups, refining the crystal structure of BMTO remains an unresolved problem that needs additional high-resolution XRD and neutron diffraction studies on high-quality single crystals. It is thought, however, that structural assignments will not greatly influence any of the primary findings related to the magnetism and spin dynamics of BMTO. These consist of a magnetic phase transition at around 21 K, the observation of antiferromagnetic magnon excitations exhibiting a gap of 1.4 K beneath the phase transition, the presence of short-range spin correlations well above the antiferromagnetic phase transition, and the persistence of spin dynamics even within the magnetically ordered phase. It is important to note that the magnetization, specific heat, and muon spin relaxation findings that constitute the core of our earlier study are independent; the interpretation of these findings did not rely on any specific space group. Concerning the final allocation of the symmetry of BMTO, a definitive differentiation in certain physical characteristics resulting from the symmetry is still necessary.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Real-Time Analysis of Inelastic Neutron Scattering Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate calculation of phonons and vibrational spectra remains a significant challenge, requiring highly precise evaluations of interatomic forces. Traditional methods based on the quantum description of the electronic structure, while widely used, are computationally expensive and demand substantial expertise. Emerging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) offer a transformative alternative by employing pre-trained neural network surrogates to predict interatomic forces directly from atomic coordinates. This approach dramatically reduces computation time and minimizes the need for technical knowledge. In this paper, we produce a phonon database comprising nearly 5,000 inorganic crystals to benchmark the performance of several leading uMLIPs. We further assess these models in real-world applications by using them to analyze experimental inelastic neutron scattering data collected on a variety of materials. Through detailed comparisons, we identify the strengths and limitations of these uMLIPs, providing insights into their accuracy and suitability for fast calculations of phonons and related properties, as well as for real-time interpretation of neutron scattering spectra. Our findings highlight how the rapid advancement of AI in science is revolutionizing experimental research and data analysis.</description>

      <title>NepTrain and NepTrainKit: Automated Active Learning and Visualization Toolkit for Neuroevolution Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a machine-learned potential, the neuroevolution potential (NEP) method features exceptional computational efficiency and has been successfully applied in materials science. Constructing high-quality training datasets is crucial for developing accurate NEP models. However, the preparation and screening of NEP training datasets remain a bottleneck for broader applications due to their time-consuming, labor-intensive, and resource-intensive nature. In this work, we have developed NepTrain and NepTrainKit, which are dedicated to initializing and managing training datasets to generate high-quality training sets while automating NEP model training. NepTrain is an open-source Python package that features a bond length filtering method to effectively identify and remove non-physical structures from molecular dynamics trajectories, thereby ensuring high-quality training datasets. NepTrainKit is a graphical user interface (GUI) software designed specifically for NEP training datasets, providing functionalities for data editing, visualization, and interactive exploration. It integrates key features such as outlier identification, farthest-point sampling, non-physical structure detection, and configuration type selection. The combination of these tools enables users to process datasets more efficiently and conveniently. Using $\rm CsPbI_3$ as a case study, we demonstrate the complete workflow for training NEP models with NepTrain and further validate the models through materials property predictions. We believe this toolkit will greatly benefit researchers working with machine learning interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Investigating amorphization as a deformation mechanism using a novel phase field model at the mesoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphization during severe plastic deformation has been observed in various crystalline materials, yet its
  underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study introduces a novel phase-field model at the mesoscale,
  integrating elastoplastic theory with a deviatoric stress-dependent transformation strain tensor to capture
  stress-induced amorphization. The model enables quantitative predictions of amorphous phase nucleation and
  propagation under high stress, resolving distinctive microstructural patterns such as amorphous shear bands.
  Simulations reveal key phenomena, including avalanche-like amorphization, grain size effects, the Hall-Petch effect,
  and surface amorphization, consistent with experimental observations. By bridging phase-field methods with elastoplastic
  theory, this work provides a robust framework for studying amorphization as a deformation mechanism and offers valuable
  insights for designing materials resistant to extreme mechanical conditions.</description>

      <title>Optical Properties and Spin States of Inter-layer Carbon Defect Pairs in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are prominent single photon emitters (SPEs), and their potential for spin activity ($S\geq1$) is particularly intriguing. While studies have largely focused on intra-layer defects, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate inter-layer dimers of identical carbon species (C$_X$C$_X$). We demonstrate that these C$_X$C$_X$ pairs can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature when closely spaced (e.g., within 3.5-7.1 {\AA}) across hBN layers. As their separation increases beyond this range (e.g., $&gt;7$ {\AA}), they transition into weakly interacting $S=1/2$ pairs, characterized by singlet-triplet degeneracy. This regime is predicted to result in a very small zero-field splitting for the triplet manifold, offering a potential explanation for certain optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signals. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of these inter-layer C$_X$C$_X$ pairs is found to be practically monochromatic and within the visible range. Furthermore, we identify specific C$_B$C$_B$ inter-layer configurations exhibiting atypical low-energy phonon replicas due to out-of-plane vibrational coupling, a finding that may clarify the vibronic structure of other hBN emitters, such as the 'yellow emitters'.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic ordering with spin reorientation transition and optical properties in Dy$_2$CoCrO$_6$ nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline Dy$_2$CoCrO$_6$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Probing the Limit of Heat Transfer in Inorganic Crystals with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer is a fundamental property of matter. Research spanning decades has attempted to discover materials with exceptional thermal conductivity, yet the upper limit remains unknown. Using deep learning accelerated crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculation, we systematically explore the thermal conductivity landscape of inorganic crystals. We brute-force over half a million ordered crystalline structures, encompassing an extensive coverage of local energy minima in binary compounds with up to four atoms per primitive cell. We confirm diamond sets the upper bound of thermal conductivity within our search space, very likely also among all stable crystalline solids at ambient conditions. We also identify over 20 novel crystals surpassing silicon in thermal conductivity, validated by density functional theory. These include a semiconductor TaN with ultrahigh thermal conductivity (~900 $\mathrm{W\cdot m^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}}$), and metallic compounds such as MnV that exhibit high lattice and electronic thermal conductivity simultaneously, a distinctive feature not observed before. These results as well as the deep learning-driven screening method, redefine the landscape of thermal transport and establish a large open-access database for future materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most AI-for-Materials research to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials inevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional technologies. The defects break geometric symmetry and increase interaction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models. Here, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet), a model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions and geometric configurations in point-defect structures. DefiNet achieves near-DFT-level structural predictions in milliseconds using a single GPU. To validate its accuracy, we perform DFT relaxations using DefiNet-predicted structures as initial configurations and measure the residual ionic steps. For most defect structures, regardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required to reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability and extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a valuable tool for defect-focused materials research.</description>

      <title>Three regimes of a picosecond magnetoacoustics in ferromagnetic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of magnonics requires energy-efficient methods for generating spin waves and controlling their parameters. Acoustic waves are known to resonantly excite spin waves through magneto-elastic wave formation or to induce non-resonant forced magnetization oscillations. Short acoustic wavepackets enable another unexplored resonant interaction regime -- the Cherenkov radiation of spin waves. This raises a question regarding the criteria and signatures of these three regimes of picosecond magnetoacoustics.Here, we use a scanning magneto-optical pump-probe technique to directly observe all three regimes of interaction between laser-driven acoustic and magnetostatic wavepackets in a thin permalloy film and a waveguide fabricated on Si substrate. Direct measurements of the phase velocities reveal the transition from a coupled magneto-elastic wavepacket to Cherenkov-like radiation and the non-resonant regime, controlled by the detuning between magnon and phonon group velocities. The acoustic pulse is found to be affected by the excited magnetization dynamics only in the magneto-elastic regime.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic observables and Berry curvatures in insulators and metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A sharp definition of what "adiabatic" means is given; it is then shown that the time-dependent expectation value of a quantum-mechanical observable in the adiabatic limit can be expressed -- in many cases -- by means of the appropriate Berry curvature. Condensed-matter observables belonging to this class include: Born effective charges in insulators and in metals, quantized Faraday charges in electrolytes, and linear dc conductivities (longitudinal and transverse). Remarkably, the adiabatic limit is well defined even in metals, despite the absence of a spectral gap therein. For all of the above observables the explicit Berry-curvature expressions are derived in a general many-body setting, which also allows for compact and very transparent notations and formulas. Their conversion into band-structure formulas in the independent-electron crystalline case is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity-enhanced magnetic field noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the stray magnetic field noise outside a two-dimensional superconductor. Our considerations are motivated by recent experiments, which observed an enhancement in the magnetic field noise below the superconducting critical temperature based on the relaxation of diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers. Such enhancement is not captured by the standard two-fluid model for the superconducting state, recently proposed to explain such NV relaxometry experiments. Instead, we show that a microscopic BCS theory captures such an enhancement, and we compare with a similar theory and phenomenon, known as the Hebel-Schlicter peak (or coherence peak), observed in the relaxation of nuclear spins in the material. The primary difference is that the NV probes long-wavelength magnetic noise outside the sample, while the nuclear spin probes local hyperfine noise inside the sample. Accordingly, the noise probed by the NV depends on its height and can probe, in pristine samples, the superfluid coherence length. Finally, we discuss potential avenues for NVs to probe unconventional superconductivity via deviations from the above BCS theory.</description>

      <title>Spin-Splitting Magnetoresistance in Altermagnetic RuO2 Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Nevertheless, the altermagnetism of RuO2, one of the earliest-discovered altermagnets, is currently under intense debate. Here we try to resolve this controversy by demonstrating an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) effect that is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. Compared to the spin Hall magnetoresistance induced by a conventional relativistic spin current, the SSMR is characterized by unusual angular dependence with a phase-shift feature underpinned by the Neel-vector orientation and pronounced temperature dependence caused by its susceptibility to electron scattering. Through systematical investigations on the magnetoresistance of (101)-RuO2/Co bilayers, we disentangle a sizable SSMR and hence unveil a Neel vector along [001] direction. Our work not only demonstrates a simple electric avenue to probing the Neel vector of altermagnets, but also indicates long-range magnetic order in thin films of RuO2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a first-principles investigation of the electronic and optical properties of gallium nitride (GaN) bilayers, focusing on the influence of interlayer sliding and spacing. In contrast to the earlier studies on discrete stacking configurations, we explore the dynamic evolution of the properties during transitions between stable stacking arrangements. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically analyze the impact of these structural variations on the electronic band structure and optical absorption spectra of GaN bilayers. The analysis includes both high-symmetry stacking configurations (AA', AB', and AC') and intermediate states generated by controlled in-plane atomic displacements, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the property changes associated with interlayer sliding. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential for tuning the electronic and optical response of two-dimensional GaN for applications in nanoscale photonic and electronic devices, where precise control over interlayer interactions and stacking is crucial.</description>

      <title>Identifying Materials-Level Sources of Performance Variation in Superconducting Transmon Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</description>

Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. We address this challenge by introducing a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion as an efficient numerical approach to the DSF for arbitrary lattices. We focus on the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model and spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We present a user-friendly numerical implementation and provide comprehensive benchmarks on spin chains. As applications we treat a variety of frustrated two- and three dimensional antiferromagnets. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for a S=1 pyrochlore material.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body exciton g-factors: magnetic hybridization and non-monotonic Rydberg series in monolayer WSe$_2$</title>

Abstract: Magneto-optics of low dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, offers a vast playground for exploring complex quantum phenomena. However, current ab initio approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe$_2$, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s-4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</description>

      <title>Uncovering relationships between the electronic self-energy and coupled-cluster doubles theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. The resulting analysis leads to an expression for the ground state correlation energy that is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <title>Bubble-Burst Synthesis of Ammonia, Amino Acids, and Urea Under Ambient, Catalyst-Free Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a catalyst-free, ambient-temperature method for synthesizing nitrogen-based compounds critical to fertilizer production, including ammonia, urea, ammonium salts, and amino acids. The process relies on bubble-burst-induced microenvironments, where gas bubbles undergo rapid growth and collapse, releasing intense localized energy sufficient to dissociate nitrogen and water molecules. These high-energy zones produce reactive species, including atomic hydrogen (H*) that facilitate nitrogen fixation and drive subsequent chemical transformations without needing catalysts or elevated conditions. Experimental validation using colorimetric assays, Raman spectroscopy, and microscopy confirms the in situ formation of ammonia and its downstream conversion into structurally relevant compounds, including peptide-like assemblies. The system supports reaction tuning through dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) or organic acids and can be enhanced by low-energy inputs such as UV or ultrasound. Its simplicity, modularity, and ability to operate without external infrastructure offer a practical and scalable platform for decentralized fertilizer generation and sustainable biochemical production.</description>
