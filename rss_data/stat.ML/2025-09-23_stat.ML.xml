      <title>Low-Rank Adaptation of Evolutionary Deep Neural Networks for Efficient Learning of Time-Dependent PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Evolutionary Deep Neural Network (EDNN) framework for accelerating numerical solvers of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). We introduce a Low-Rank Evolutionary Deep Neural Network (LR-EDNN), which constrains parameter evolution to a low-rank subspace, thereby reducing the effective dimensionality of training while preserving solution accuracy. The low-rank tangent subspace is defined layer-wise by the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the current network weights, and the resulting update is obtained by solving a well-posed, tractable linear system within this subspace. This design augments the underlying numerical solver with a parameter efficient EDNN component without requiring full fine-tuning of all network weights. We evaluate LR-EDNN on representative PDE problems and compare it against corresponding baselines. Across cases, LR-EDNN achieves comparable accuracy with substantially fewer trainable parameters and reduced computational cost. These results indicate that low-rank constraints on parameter velocities, rather than full-space updates, provide a practical path toward scalable, efficient, and reproducible scientific machine learning for PDEs.</description>

      <title>Conditional Multidimensional Scaling with Incomplete Conditioning Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional multidimensional scaling seeks for a low-dimensional configuration from pairwise dissimilarities, in the presence of other known features. By taking advantage of available data of the known features, conditional multidimensional scaling improves the estimation quality of the low-dimensional configuration and simplifies knowledge discovery tasks. However, existing conditional multidimensional scaling methods require full data of the known features, which may not be always attainable due to time, cost, and other constraints. This paper proposes a conditional multidimensional scaling method that can learn the low-dimensional configuration when there are missing values in the known features. The method can also impute the missing values, which provides additional insights of the problem. Computer codes of this method are maintained in the cml R package on CRAN.</description>

      <title>System-Level Uncertainty Quantification with Multiple Machine Learning Models: A Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ML models have errors when used for predictions. The errors are unknown but can be quantified by model uncertainty. When multiple ML models are trained using the same training points, their model uncertainties may be statistically dependent. In reality, model inputs are also random with input uncertainty. The effects of these types of uncertainty must be considered in decision-making and design. This study develops a theoretical framework that generates the joint distribution of multiple ML predictions given the joint distribution of model uncertainties and the joint distribution of model inputs. The strategy is to decouple the coupling between the two types of uncertainty and transform them as independent random variables. The framework lays a foundation for numerical algorithm development for various specific applications.</description>

      <title>DoubleGen: Debiased Generative Modeling of Counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for counterfactual outcomes face two key sources of bias. Confounding bias arises when approaches fail to account for systematic differences between those who receive the intervention and those who do not. Misspecification bias arises when methods attempt to address confounding through estimation of an auxiliary model, but specify it incorrectly. We introduce DoubleGen, a doubly robust framework that modifies generative modeling training objectives to mitigate these biases. The new objectives rely on two auxiliaries -- a propensity and outcome model -- and successfully address confounding bias even if only one of them is correct. We provide finite-sample guarantees for this robustness property. We further establish conditions under which DoubleGen achieves oracle optimality -- matching the convergence rates standard approaches would enjoy if interventional data were available -- and minimax rate optimality. We illustrate DoubleGen with three examples: diffusion models, flow matching, and autoregressive language models.</description>

      <title>Risk Comparisons in Linear Regression: Implicit Regularization Dominates Explicit Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing theory suggests that for linear regression problems categorized by capacity and source conditions, gradient descent (GD) is always minimax optimal, while both ridge regression and online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are polynomially suboptimal for certain categories of such problems. Moving beyond minimax theory, this work provides instance-wise comparisons of the finite-sample risks for these algorithms on any well-specified linear regression problem.
  Our analysis yields three key findings. First, GD dominates ridge regression: with comparable regularization, the excess risk of GD is always within a constant factor of ridge, but ridge can be polynomially worse even when tuned optimally. Second, GD is incomparable with SGD. While it is known that for certain problems GD can be polynomially better than SGD, the reverse is also true: we construct problems, inspired by benign overfitting theory, where optimally stopped GD is polynomially worse. Finally, GD dominates SGD for a significant subclass of problems -- those with fast and continuously decaying covariance spectra -- which includes all problems satisfying the standard capacity condition.</description>

      <title>Bias-variance Tradeoff in Tensor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study denoising of a third-order tensor when the ground-truth tensor is not necessarily Tucker low-rank. Specifically, we observe $$ Y=X^\ast+Z\in \mathbb{R}^{p_{1} \times p_{2} \times p_{3}}, $$ where $X^\ast$ is the ground-truth tensor, and $Z$ is the noise tensor. We propose a simple variant of the higher-order tensor SVD estimator $\widetilde{X}$. We show that uniformly over all user-specified Tucker ranks $(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})$, $$ \| \widetilde{X} - X^* \|_{ \mathrm{F}}^2 = O \Big( \kappa^2 \Big\{ r_{1}r_{2}r_{3}+\sum_{k=1}^{3} p_{k} r_{k} \Big\} \; + \; \xi_{(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})}^2\Big) \quad \text{ with high probability.} $$ Here, the bias term $\xi_{(r_1,r_2,r_3)}$ corresponds to the best achievable approximation error of $X^\ast$ over the class of tensors with Tucker ranks $(r_1,r_2,r_3)$; $\kappa^2$ quantifies the noise level; and the variance term $\kappa^2 \{r_{1}r_{2}r_{3}+\sum_{k=1}^{3} p_{k} r_{k}\}$ scales with the effective number of free parameters in the estimator $\widetilde{X}$. Our analysis achieves a clean rank-adaptive bias--variance tradeoff: as we increase the ranks of estimator $\widetilde{X}$, the bias $\xi(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})$ decreases and the variance increases. As a byproduct we also obtain a convenient bias-variance decomposition for the vanilla low-rank SVD matrix estimators.</description>

      <title>Robust Mixture Models for Algorithmic Fairness Under Latent Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard machine learning models optimized for average performance often fail on minority subgroups and lack robustness to distribution shifts. This challenge worsens when subgroups are latent and affected by complex interactions among continuous and discrete features. We introduce ROME (RObust Mixture Ensemble), a framework that learns latent group structure from data while optimizing for worst-group performance. ROME employs two approaches: an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for linear models and a neural Mixture-of-Experts for nonlinear settings. Through simulations and experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ROME significantly improves algorithmic fairness compared to standard methods while maintaining competitive average performance. Importantly, our method requires no predefined group labels, making it practical when sources of disparities are unknown or evolving.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Distribution Compression: Reducing Both Data Size and Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods reduce dataset size by minimising the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost.</description>

      <title>Whitening Spherical Gaussian Mixtures in the Large-Dimensional Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whitening is a classical technique in unsupervised learning that can facilitate estimation tasks by standardizing data. An important application is the estimation of latent variable models via the decomposition of tensors built from high-order moments. In particular, whitening orthogonalizes the means of a spherical Gaussian mixture model (GMM), thereby making the corresponding moment tensor orthogonally decomposable, hence easier to decompose. However, in the large-dimensional regime (LDR) where data are high-dimensional and scarce, the standard whitening matrix built from the sample covariance becomes ineffective because the latter is spectrally distorted. Consequently, whitened means of a spherical GMM are no longer orthogonal. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact limits for their dot products, which are generally nonzero in the LDR. As our main contribution, we then construct a corrected whitening matrix that restores asymptotic orthogonality, allowing for performance gains in spherical GMM estimation.</description>

      <title>Robust, Online, and Adaptive Decentralized Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a flexible, uncertainty-aware framework for modeling complex signals, but scale cubically with data, assume static targets, and are brittle to outliers, limiting their applicability in large-scale problems with dynamic and noisy environments. Recent work introduced decentralized random Fourier feature Gaussian processes (DRFGP), an online and distributed algorithm that casts GPs in an information-filter form, enabling exact sequential inference and fully distributed computation without reliance on a fusion center. In this paper, we extend DRFGP along two key directions: first, by introducing a robust-filtering update that downweights the impact of atypical observations; and second, by incorporating a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adapts to time-varying functions. The resulting algorithm retains the recursive information-filter structure while enhancing stability and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a large-scale Earth system application, underscoring its potential for in-situ modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient boosting has become a cornerstone of machine learning, enabling base learners such as decision trees to achieve exceptional predictive performance. While existing algorithms primarily handle scalar or Euclidean outputs, increasingly prevalent complex-structured data, such as distributions, networks, and manifold-valued outputs, present challenges for traditional methods. Such non-Euclidean data lack algebraic structures such as addition, subtraction, or scalar multiplication required by standard gradient boosting frameworks. To address these challenges, we introduce Fr\'echet geodesic boosting (FGBoost), a novel approach tailored for outputs residing in geodesic metric spaces. FGBoost leverages geodesics as proxies for residuals and constructs ensembles in a way that respects the intrinsic geometry of the output space. Through theoretical analysis, extensive simulations, and real-world applications, we demonstrate the strong performance and adaptability of FGBoost, showcasing its potential for modeling complex data.</description>

      <title>Kernel K-means clustering of distributional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of clustering a sample of probability distributions from a random distribution on $\mathbb R^p$. Our proposed partitioning method makes use of a symmetric, positive-definite kernel $k$ and its associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) $\mathcal H$. By mapping each distribution to its corresponding kernel mean embedding in $\mathcal H$, we obtain a sample in this RKHS where we carry out the $K$-means clustering procedure, which provides an unsupervised classification of the original sample. The procedure is simple and computationally feasible even for dimension $p&gt;1$. The simulation studies provide insight into the choice of the kernel and its tuning parameter. The performance of the proposed clustering procedure is illustrated on a collection of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.</description>

      <title>Functional effects models: Accounting for preference heterogeneity in panel data with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general specification for Functional Effects Models, which use Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to learn individual-specific preference parameters from socio-demographic characteristics, therefore accounting for inter-individual heterogeneity in panel choice data. We identify three specific advantages of the Functional Effects Model over traditional fixed, and random/mixed effects models: (i) by mapping individual-specific effects as a function of socio-demographic variables, we can account for these effects when forecasting choices of previously unobserved individuals (ii) the (approximate) maximum-likelihood estimation of functional effects avoids the incidental parameters problem of the fixed effects model, even when the number of observed choices per individual is small; and (iii) we do not rely on the strong distributional assumptions of the random effects model, which may not match reality. We learn functional intercept and functional slopes with powerful non-linear machine learning regressors for tabular data, namely gradient boosting decision trees and deep neural networks. We validate our proposed methodology on a synthetic experiment and three real-world panel case studies, demonstrating that the Functional Effects Model: (i) can identify the true values of individual-specific effects when the data generation process is known; (ii) outperforms both state-of-the-art ML choice modelling techniques that omit individual heterogeneity in terms of predictive performance, as well as traditional static panel choice models in terms of learning inter-individual heterogeneity. The results indicate that the FI-RUMBoost model, which combines the individual-specific constants of the Functional Effects Model with the complex, non-linear utilities of RUMBoost, performs marginally best on large-scale revealed preference panel data.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Deterministic and Probabilistic Machine Learning Algorithms for Precise Dimensional Control and Uncertainty Quantification in Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework to accurately estimate dimensions of additively manufactured components. Using a dataset of 405 parts from nine production runs involving two machines, three polymer materials, and two-part configurations, we examine five key design features. To capture both design information and manufacturing variability, we employ models integrating continuous and categorical factors. For predicting Difference from Target (DFT) values, we test deterministic and probabilistic machine learning methods. Deterministic models, trained on 80% of the dataset, provide precise point estimates, with Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieving accuracy close to process repeatability. To address systematic deviations, we adopt Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). GPR delivers strong predictive performance and interpretability, while BNNs capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. We investigate two BNN approaches: one balancing accuracy and uncertainty capture, and another offering richer uncertainty decomposition but with lower dimensional accuracy. Our results underscore the importance of quantifying epistemic uncertainty for robust decision-making, risk assessment, and model improvement. We discuss trade-offs between GPR and BNNs in terms of predictive power, interpretability, and computational efficiency, noting that model choice depends on analytical needs. By combining deterministic precision with probabilistic uncertainty quantification, our study provides a rigorous foundation for uncertainty-aware predictive modeling in AM. This approach not only enhances dimensional accuracy but also supports reliable, risk-informed design strategies, thereby advancing data-driven manufacturing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Learning Centre Partitions from Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-centre studies increasingly rely on distributed inference, where sites share only centre-level summaries. Homogeneity of parameters across centres is often violated, motivating methods that both \emph{test} for equality and \emph{learn} centre groupings before estimation. We develop multivariate Cochran-type tests that operate on summary statistics and embed them in a sequential, test-driven \emph{Clusters-of-Centres (CoC)} algorithm that merges centres (or blocks) only when equality is not rejected. We derive the asymptotic $\chi^2$-mixture distributions of the test statistics and provide plug-in estimators for implementation. To improve finite-sample integration, we introduce a multi-round bootstrap CoC that re-evaluates merges across independently resampled summary sets; under mild regularity and a separation condition, we prove a \emph{golden-partition recovery} result: as the number of rounds grows with $n$, the true partition is recovered with probability tending to one. We also give simple numerical guidelines, including a plateau-based stopping rule, to make the multi-round procedure reproducible. Simulations and a real-data analysis of U.S.\ airline on-time performance (2007) show accurate heterogeneity detection and partitions that change little with the choice of resampling scheme.</description>

      <title>EMPEROR: Efficient Moment-Preserving Representation of Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EMPEROR (Efficient Moment-Preserving Representation of Distributions), a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for representing high-dimensional probability measures arising in neural network representations. Unlike heuristic global pooling operations, EMPEROR encodes a feature distribution through its statistical moments. Our approach leverages the theory of sliced moments: features are projected onto multiple directions, lightweight univariate Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are fit to each projection, and the resulting slice parameters are aggregated into a compact descriptor. We establish determinacy guarantees via Carleman's condition and the Cram\'er-Wold theorem, ensuring that the GMM is uniquely determined by its sliced moments, and we derive finite-sample error bounds that scale optimally with the number of slices and samples. Empirically, EMPEROR captures richer distributional information than common pooling schemes across various data modalities, while remaining computationally efficient and broadly applicable.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Retrieval: The Geometry and a Pretrain-Finetune Recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual encoder (DE) models, where a pair of matching query and document are embedded into similar vector representations, are widely used in information retrieval due to their simplicity and scalability. However, the Euclidean geometry of the embedding space limits the expressive power of DEs, which may compromise their quality. This paper investigates such limitations in the context of hierarchical retrieval (HR), where the document set has a hierarchical structure and the matching documents for a query are all of its ancestors. We first prove that DEs are feasible for HR as long as the embedding dimension is linear in the depth of the hierarchy and logarithmic in the number of documents. Then we study the problem of learning such embeddings in a standard retrieval setup where DEs are trained on samples of matching query and document pairs. Our experiments reveal a lost-in-the-long-distance phenomenon, where retrieval accuracy degrades for documents further away in the hierarchy. To address this, we introduce a pretrain-finetune recipe that significantly improves long-distance retrieval without sacrificing performance on closer documents. We experiment on a realistic hierarchy from WordNet for retrieving documents at various levels of abstraction, and show that pretrain-finetune boosts the recall on long-distance pairs from 19% to 76%. Finally, we demonstrate that our method improves retrieval of relevant products on a shopping queries dataset.</description>

      <title>Overfitting in Adaptive Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive robust optimization (ARO) extends static robust optimization by allowing decisions to depend on the realized uncertainty - weakly dominating static solutions within the modeled uncertainty set. However, ARO makes previous constraints that were independent of uncertainty now dependent, making it vulnerable to additional infeasibilities when realizations fall outside the uncertainty set. This phenomenon of adaptive policies being brittle is analogous to overfitting in machine learning. To mitigate against this, we propose assigning constraint-specific uncertainty set sizes, with harder constraints given stronger probabilistic guarantees. Interpreted through the overfitting lens, this acts as regularization: tighter guarantees shrink adaptive coefficients to ensure stability, while looser ones preserve useful flexibility. This view motivates a principled approach to designing uncertainty sets that balances robustness and adaptivity.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Sample Complexity Bounds for Constrained Average-Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the sample complexity of learning in average-reward Markov decision processes (AMDPs) under the generative model. However, much less is known about the constrained average-reward MDP (CAMDP), where policies must satisfy long-run average constraints. In this work, we address this gap by studying the sample complexity of learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in CAMDPs under a generative model. We propose a model-based algorithm that operates under two settings: (i) relaxed feasibility, which allows small constraint violations, and (ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy satisfies the constraint. We show that our algorithm achieves sample complexities of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$ and $\tilde{O} \left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{\epsilon^2 \zeta^2} \right)$ under the relaxed and strict feasibility settings, respectively. Here, $\zeta$ is the Slater constant indicating the size of the feasible region, $H$ is the span bound of the bias function, and $B$ is the transient time bound. Moreover, a matching lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ for the strict feasibility case is established, thus providing the first minimax-optimal bounds for CAMDPs. Our results close the theoretical gap in understanding the complexity of constrained average-reward MDPs.</description>

      <title>Gradient Interference-Aware Graph Coloring for Multitask Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated. The grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, model performance will be improved rather than impeded. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers.</description>

      <title>Hessian-guided Perturbed Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Escaping Saddle Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF) is a common method to perform optimization over the space of probability measures. While WGF is guaranteed to converge to a first-order stationary point, for nonconvex functionals the converged solution does not necessarily satisfy the second-order optimality condition; i.e., it could converge to a saddle point. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for probability measure optimization, perturbed Wasserstein gradient flow (PWGF), that achieves second-order optimality for general nonconvex objectives. PWGF enhances WGF by injecting noisy perturbations near saddle points via a Gaussian process-based scheme. By pushing the measure forward along a random vector field generated from a Gaussian process, PWGF helps the solution escape saddle points efficiently by perturbing the solution towards the smallest eigenvalue direction of the Wasserstein Hessian. We theoretically derive the computational complexity for PWGF to achieve a second-order stationary point. Furthermore, we prove that PWGF converges to a global optimum in polynomial time for strictly benign objectives.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Performance and Calibration in Quantile Hyperparameter Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian hyperparameter optimization relies heavily on Gaussian Process (GP) surrogates, due to robust distributional posteriors and strong performance on limited training samples. GPs however underperform in categorical hyperparameter environments or when assumptions of normality, heteroskedasticity and symmetry are excessively challenged. Conformalized quantile regression can address these estimation weaknesses, while still providing robust calibration guarantees. This study builds upon early work in this area by addressing feedback covariate shift in sequential acquisition and integrating a wider range of surrogate architectures and acquisition functions. Proposed algorithms are rigorously benchmarked against a range of state of the art hyperparameter optimization methods (GP, TPE and SMAC). Findings identify quantile surrogate architectures and acquisition functions yielding superior performance to the current quantile literature, while validating the beneficial impact of conformalization on calibration and search performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describe a wide range of physical systems. As such, data-driven simulations of Hamiltonian systems are important for many scientific and engineering problems. In this work, we propose kernel-based methods for identifying and forecasting Hamiltonian systems directly from data. We present two approaches: a two-step method that reconstructs trajectories before learning the Hamiltonian, and a one-step method that jointly infers both. Across several benchmark systems, including mass-spring dynamics, a nonlinear pendulum, and the Henon-Heiles system, we demonstrate that our framework achieves accurate, data-efficient predictions and outperforms two-step kernel-based baselines, particularly in scarce-data regimes, while preserving the conservation properties of Hamiltonian dynamics. Moreover, our methodology provides theoretical a priori error estimates, ensuring reliability of the learned models. We also provide a more general, problem-agnostic numerical framework that goes beyond Hamiltonian systems and can be used for data-driven learning of arbitrary dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On Quantification of Borrowing of Information in Hierarchical Bayesian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we offer a thorough analytical investigation into the role of shared hyperparameters in a hierarchical Bayesian model, examining their impact on information borrowing and posterior inference. Our approach is rooted in a non-asymptotic framework, where observations are drawn from a mixed-effects model, and a Gaussian distribution is assumed for the true effect generator. We consider a nested hierarchical prior distribution model to capture these effects and use the posterior means for Bayesian estimation. To quantify the effect of information borrowing, we propose an integrated risk measure relative to the true data-generating distribution. Our analysis reveals that the Bayes estimator for the model with a deeper hierarchy performs better, provided that the unknown random effects are correlated through a compound symmetric structure. Our work also identifies necessary and sufficient conditions for this model to outperform the one nested within it. We further obtain sufficient conditions when the correlation is perturbed. Our study suggests that the model with a deeper hierarchy tends to outperform the nested model unless the true data-generating distribution favors sufficiently independent groups. These findings have significant implications for Bayesian modeling, and we believe they will be of interest to researchers across a wide range of fields.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Semi-supervised Inference via a Debiased Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference in semi-supervised (SS) settings has gained substantial attention in recent years due to increased relevance in modern big-data problems. In a typical SS setting, there is a much larger-sized unlabeled data, containing only observations of predictors, and a moderately sized labeled data containing observations for both an outcome and the set of predictors. Such data naturally arises when the outcome, unlike the predictors, is costly or difficult to obtain. One of the primary statistical objectives in SS settings is to explore whether parameter estimation can be improved by exploiting the unlabeled data. We propose a novel Bayesian method for estimating the population mean in SS settings. The approach yields estimators that are both efficient and optimal for estimation and inference. The method itself has several interesting artifacts. The central idea behind the method is to model certain summary statistics of the data in a targeted manner, rather than the entire raw data itself, along with a novel Bayesian notion of debiasing. Specifying appropriate summary statistics crucially relies on a debiased representation of the population mean that incorporates unlabeled data through a flexible nuisance function while also learning its estimation bias. Combined with careful usage of sample splitting, this debiasing approach mitigates the effect of bias due to slow rates or misspecification of the nuisance parameter from the posterior of the final parameter of interest, ensuring its robustness and efficiency. Concrete theoretical results, via Bernstein--von Mises theorems, are established, validating all claims, and are further supported through extensive numerical studies. To our knowledge, this is possibly the first work on Bayesian inference in SS settings, and its central ideas also apply more broadly to other Bayesian semi-parametric inference problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular data dominates data science but poses challenges for generative models, especially when the data is limited or sensitive. We present a novel approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise, third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing, GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse subject domains (68\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations, provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore, MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs. categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data. GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance generative models for structured data.</description>

      <title>Synth-MIA: A Testbed for Auditing Privacy Leakage in Tabular Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular Generative Models are often argued to preserve privacy by creating synthetic datasets that resemble training data. However, auditing their empirical privacy remains challenging, as commonly used similarity metrics fail to effectively characterize privacy risk. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have recently emerged as a method for evaluating privacy leakage in synthetic data, but their practical effectiveness is limited. Numerous attacks exist across different threat models, each with distinct implementations targeting various sources of privacy leakage, making them difficult to apply consistently. Moreover, no single attack consistently outperforms the others, leading to a routine underestimation of privacy risk.
  To address these issues, we propose a unified, model-agnostic threat framework that deploys a collection of attacks to estimate the maximum empirical privacy leakage in synthetic datasets. We introduce Synth-MIA, an open-source Python library that streamlines this auditing process through a novel testbed that integrates seamlessly into existing synthetic data evaluation pipelines through a Scikit-Learn-like API. Our software implements 13 attack methods through a Scikit-Learn-like API, designed to enable fast systematic estimation of privacy leakage for practitioners as well as facilitate the development of new attacks and experiments for researchers.
  We demonstrate our framework's utility in the largest tabular synthesis privacy benchmark to date, revealing that higher synthetic data quality corresponds to greater privacy leakage, that similarity-based privacy metrics show weak correlation with MIA results, and that the differentially private generator PATEGAN can fail to preserve privacy under such attacks. This underscores the necessity of MIA-based auditing when designing and deploying Tabular Generative Models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel element-wise subset selection method for the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, focusing on low-rank matrix factorization involving matrices with missing values, as commonly encountered in recommender systems. While ALS is widely used for providing personalized recommendations based on user-item interaction data, its high computational cost, stemming from repeated regression operations, poses significant challenges for large-scale datasets. To enhance the efficiency of ALS, we propose a core-elements subsampling method that selects a representative subset of data and leverages sparse matrix operations to approximate ALS estimations efficiently. We establish theoretical guarantees for the approximation and convergence of the proposed approach, showing that it achieves similar accuracy with significantly reduced computational time compared to full-data ALS. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios, emphasizing its potential in large-scale recommendation systems.</description>

Abstract: One can see deep-learning models as compositions of functions within the so-called tame geometry. In this expository note, we give an overview of some topics at the interface of tame geometry (also known as o-minimality), optimization theory, and deep learning theory and practice. To do so, we gradually introduce the concepts and tools used to build convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent in a general nonsmooth nonconvex, but tame, setting. This illustrates some ways in which tame geometry is a natural mathematical framework for the study of AI systems, especially within Deep Learning.</description>

      <title>Validation-Free Sparse Learning: A Phase Transition Approach to Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing environmental footprint of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in terms of storage and computation, calls for more frugal and interpretable models. Sparse models (e.g., linear, neural networks) offer a promising solution by selecting only the most relevant features, reducing complexity, preventing over-fitting and enabling interpretation-marking a step towards truly intelligent AI.
  The concept of a right amount of sparsity (without too many false positive or too few true positive) is subjective. So we propose a new paradigm previously only observed and mathematically studied for compressed sensing (noiseless linear models): obtaining a phase transition in the probability of retrieving the relevant features. We show in practice how to obtain this phase transition for a class of sparse learners. Our approach is flexible and applicable to complex models ranging from linear to shallow and deep artificial neural networks while supporting various loss functions and sparsity-promoting penalties. It does not rely on cross-validation or on a validation set to select its single regularization parameter. For real-world data, it provides a good balance between predictive accuracy and feature sparsity.
  A Python package is available at https://github.com/VcMaxouuu/HarderLASSO containing all the simulations and ready-to-use models.</description>

      <title>Tight PAC-Bayesian Risk Certificates for Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03486v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive representation learning is a modern paradigm for learning representations of unlabeled data via augmentations -- precisely, contrastive models learn to embed semantically similar pairs of samples (positive pairs) closer than independently drawn samples (negative samples). In spite of its empirical success and widespread use in foundation models, statistical theory for contrastive learning remains less explored. Recent works have developed generalization error bounds for contrastive losses, but the resulting risk certificates are either vacuous (certificates based on Rademacher complexity or $f$-divergence) or require strong assumptions about samples that are unreasonable in practice. The present paper develops non-vacuous PAC-Bayesian risk certificates for contrastive representation learning, considering the practical considerations of the popular SimCLR framework. Notably, we take into account that SimCLR reuses positive pairs of augmented data as negative samples for other data, thereby inducing strong dependence and making classical PAC or PAC-Bayesian bounds inapplicable. We further refine existing bounds on the downstream classification loss by incorporating SimCLR-specific factors, including data augmentation and temperature scaling, and derive risk certificates for the contrastive zero-one risk. The resulting bounds for contrastive loss and downstream prediction are much tighter than those of previous risk certificates, as demonstrated by experiments on CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Learning Massive-scale Partial Correlation Networks in Clinical Multi-omics Studies with HP-ACCORD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical model estimation from multi-omics data requires a balance between statistical estimation performance and computational scalability. We introduce a novel pseudolikelihood-based graphical model framework that reparameterizes the target precision matrix while preserving the sparsity pattern and estimates it by minimizing an $\ell_1$-penalized empirical risk based on a new loss function. The proposed estimator maintains estimation and selection consistency in various metrics under high-dimensional assumptions. The associated optimization problem allows for a provably fast computation algorithm using a novel operator-splitting approach and communication-avoiding distributed matrix multiplication. A high-performance computing implementation of our framework was tested using simulated data with up to one million variables, demonstrating complex dependency structures similar to those found in biological networks. Leveraging this scalability, we estimated a partial correlation network from a dual-omic liver cancer data set. The co-expression network estimated from the ultrahigh-dimensional data demonstrated superior specificity in prioritizing key transcription factors and co-activators by excluding the impact of epigenetic regulation, thereby highlighting the value of computational scalability in multi-omic data analysis.</description>

      <title>An AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach for causal inference in observational studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal inference in observational studies with high-dimensional covariates presents significant challenges. We introduce CausalBGM, an AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach that captures the causal relationship among covariates, treatment, and outcome variables. The core innovation of CausalBGM lies in its ability to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) by learning individual-specific distributions of a low-dimensional latent feature set (e.g., latent confounders) that drives changes in both treatment and outcome. This approach not only effectively mitigates confounding effects but also provides comprehensive uncertainty quantification, offering reliable and interpretable causal effect estimates at the individual level. CausalBGM adopts a Bayesian model and uses a novel iterative algorithm to update the model parameters and the posterior distribution of latent features until convergence. This framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex dependencies among variables while adhering to the Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CausalBGM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional covariates and large-scale datasets. Its Bayesian foundation ensures statistical rigor, providing robust and well-calibrated posterior intervals. By addressing key limitations of existing methods, CausalBGM emerges as a robust and promising framework for advancing causal inference in modern applications in fields such as genomics, healthcare, and social sciences. CausalBGM is maintained at the website https://causalbgm.readthedocs.io/.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction with Upper and Lower Bound Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a Conformal Prediction (CP) methodology for building prediction intervals in a regression setting, given only deterministic lower and upper bounds on the target variable. It proposes a new CP mechanism (CPUL) that goes beyond post-processing by adopting a model selection approach over multiple nested interval construction methods. Paradoxically, many well-established CP methods, including CPUL, may fail to provide adequate coverage in regions where the bounds are tight. To remedy this limitation, the paper proposes an optimal thresholding mechanism, OMLT, that adjusts CPUL intervals in tight regions with undercoverage. The combined CPUL-OMLT is validated on large-scale learning tasks where the goal is to bound the optimal value of a parametric optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline methods across various datasets.</description>

      <title>AICO: Feature Significance Tests for Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge, hindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment -- particularly in high-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic significance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression or classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental contribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under the null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test set has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful, randomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing feature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for estimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal assumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains computationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings. Experiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational advantages, and applications to real-world data illustrate its practical utility.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider posterior Bayesian fully connected and feedforward deep neural networks with dependent weights. Particularly, if the likelihood is Gaussian, we identify the distribution of the wide width limit and provide an algorithm to sample from the network. In the shallow case we explicitly compute the distribution of the conditional output, proving that it is a Gaussian mixture. All the theoretical results are numerically validated.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale clustering and source separation of InSight mission seismic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16189v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised source separation involves unraveling an unknown set of source signals recorded through a mixing operator, with limited prior knowledge about the sources, and only access to a dataset of signal mixtures. This problem is inherently ill-posed and is further challenged by the variety of timescales exhibited by sources in time series data from planetary space missions. As such, a systematic multi-scale unsupervised approach is needed to identify and separate sources at different timescales. Existing methods typically rely on a preselected window size that determines their operating timescale, limiting their capacity to handle multi-scale sources. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework by leveraging wavelet scattering spectra that provide a low-dimensional representation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between different non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Nested within this representation space, we develop a factorial variational autoencoder that is trained to probabilistically cluster sources at different timescales. To perform source separation, we use samples from clusters at multiple timescales obtained via the factorial variational autoencoder as prior information and formulate an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering spectra representation space. When applied to the entire seismic dataset recorded during the NASA InSight mission on Mars, containing sources varying greatly in timescale, our approach disentangles such different sources, e.g., minute-long transient one-sided pulses (known as "glitches") and structured ambient noises resulting from atmospheric activities that typically last for tens of minutes, and provides an opportunity to conduct further investigations into the isolated sources.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Inconsistency in Bayesian Deep Learning via Generalized Laplace Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13535v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, inconsistency in Bayesian deep learning has attracted significant attention. Tempered or generalized posterior distributions are frequently employed as direct and effective solutions. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms and the effectiveness of generalized posteriors remain active research topics. In this work, we interpret posterior tempering as a correction for model misspecification via adjustments to the joint probability, and as a recalibration of priors by reducing aleatoric uncertainty. We also introduce the generalized Laplace approximation, which requires only a simple modification to the Hessian calculation of the regularized loss and provides a flexible and scalable framework for high-quality posterior inference. We evaluate the proposed method on state-of-the-art neural networks and real-world datasets, demonstrating that the generalized Laplace approximation enhances predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights into CycleGAN: Analyzing Approximation and Estimation Errors in Unpaired Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on analyzing the excess risk of the unpaired data generation model, called CycleGAN. Unlike classical GANs, CycleGAN not only transforms data between two unpaired distributions but also ensures the mappings are consistent, which is encouraged by the cycle-consistency term unique to CycleGAN. The increasing complexity of model structure and the addition of the cycle-consistency term in CycleGAN present new challenges for error analysis. By considering the impact of both the model architecture and training procedure, the risk is decomposed into two terms: approximation error and estimation error. These two error terms are analyzed separately and ultimately combined by considering the trade-off between them. Each component is rigorously analyzed; the approximation error through constructing approximations of the optimal transport maps, and the estimation error through establishing an upper bound using Rademacher complexity. Our analysis not only isolates these errors but also explores the trade-offs between them, which provides a theoretical insights of how CycleGAN's architecture and training procedures influence its performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</description>

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of the general family of steepest descent algorithms with infinitesimal learning rate in deep homogeneous neural networks. We show that: (a) an algorithm-dependent geometric margin starts increasing once the networks reach perfect training accuracy, and (b) any limit point of the training trajectory corresponds to a KKT point of the corresponding margin-maximization problem. We experimentally zoom into the trajectories of neural networks optimized with various steepest descent algorithms, highlighting connections to the implicit bias of popular adaptive methods (Adam and Shampoo).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers are deep neural network architectures that underpin the recent successes of large language models. Unlike more classical architectures that can be viewed as point-to-point maps, a Transformer acts as a measure-to-measure map implemented as specific interacting particle system on the unit sphere: the input is the empirical measure of tokens in a prompt and its evolution is governed by the continuity equation. In fact, Transformers are not limited to empirical measures and can in principle process any input measure. As the nature of data processed by Transformers is expanding rapidly, it is important to investigate their expressive power as maps from an arbitrary measure to another arbitrary measure. To that end, we provide an explicit choice of parameters that allows a single Transformer to match $N$ arbitrary input measures to $N$ arbitrary target measures, under the minimal assumption that every pair of input-target measures can be matched by some transport map.</description>

      <title>Are Deep Learning Methods Suitable for Downscaling Global Climate Projections? An Intercomparison for Temperature and Precipitation over Spain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise for downscaling global climate change projections under different approaches, including Perfect Prognosis (PP) and Regional Climate Model (RCM) emulation. Unlike emulators, PP downscaling models are trained on observational data, so it remains an open question whether they can plausibly extrapolate unseen conditions and changes in future emissions scenarios. Here we focus on this problem as the main drawback for the operationalization of these methods and present the results of an intercomparison experiment to evaluate the performance and extrapolation capability of existing models using a common experimental framework, taking into account the sensitivity of results to different training replicas. We focus on minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation over Spain, a region with a range of climatic conditions with different influential regional processes. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, limitations of existing methods, and prospects for future development.</description>

      <title>Flatten Graphs as Sequences: Transformers are Scalable Graph Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AutoGraph, a scalable autoregressive model for attributed graph generation using decoder-only transformers. By flattening graphs into random sequences of tokens through a reversible process, AutoGraph enables modeling graphs as sequences without relying on additional node features that are expensive to compute, in contrast to diffusion-based approaches. This results in sampling complexity and sequence lengths that scale optimally linearly with the number of edges, making it scalable and efficient for large, sparse graphs. A key success factor of AutoGraph is that its sequence prefixes represent induced subgraphs, creating a direct link to sub-sentences in language modeling. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and molecular benchmarks, with up to 100x faster generation and 3x faster training than leading diffusion models. It also supports substructure-conditioned generation without fine-tuning and shows promising transferability, bridging language modeling and graph generation to lay the groundwork for graph foundation models. Our code is available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/AutoGraph.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Structural-Counterfactual Generation under Domain Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the burgeoning interest in cross-domain learning, we present a novel generative modeling challenge: generating counterfactual samples in a target domain based on factual observations from a source domain. Our approach operates within an unsupervised paradigm devoid of parallel or joint datasets, relying exclusively on distinct observational samples and causal graphs for each domain. This setting presents challenges that surpass those of conventional counterfactual generation. Central to our methodology is the disambiguation of exogenous causes into effect-intrinsic and domain-intrinsic categories. This differentiation facilitates the integration of domain-specific causal graphs into a unified joint causal graph via shared effect-intrinsic exogenous variables. We propose leveraging Neural Causal models within this joint framework to enable accurate counterfactual generation under standard identifiability assumptions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel loss function that effectively segregates effect-intrinsic from domain-intrinsic variables during model training. Given a factual observation, our framework combines the posterior distribution of effect-intrinsic variables from the source domain with the prior distribution of domain-intrinsic variables from the target domain to synthesize the desired counterfactuals, adhering to Pearl's causal hierarchy. Intriguingly, when domain shifts are restricted to alterations in causal mechanisms without accompanying covariate shifts, our training regimen parallels the resolution of a conditional optimal transport problem. Empirical evaluations on a synthetic dataset show that our framework generates counterfactuals in the target domain that very closely resemble the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Algorithms for Adversarial Online Learning: from Finite to Infinite Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14790v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a form Thompson sampling for online learning under full feedback - also known as prediction with expert advice - where the learner's prior is defined over the space of an adversary's future actions, rather than the space of experts. We show regret decomposes into regret the learner expected a priori, plus a prior-robustness-type term we call excess regret. In the classical finite-expert setting, this recovers optimal rates. As an initial step towards practical online learning in settings with a potentially-uncountably-infinite number of experts, we show that Thompson sampling over the $d$-dimensional unit cube, using a certain Gaussian process prior widely-used in the Bayesian optimization literature, has a $\mathcal{O}\Big(\beta\sqrt{Td\log(1+\sqrt{d}\frac{\lambda}{\beta})}\Big)$ rate against a $\beta$-bounded $\lambda$-Lipschitz adversary.</description>

      <title>Cover Learning for Large-Scale Topology Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical unsupervised learning methods like clustering and linear dimensionality reduction parametrize large-scale geometry when it is discrete or linear, while more modern methods from manifold learning find low dimensional representation or infer local geometry by constructing a graph on the input data. More recently, topological data analysis popularized the use of simplicial complexes to represent data topology with two main methodologies: topological inference with geometric complexes and large-scale topology visualization with Mapper graphs -- central to these is the nerve construction from topology, which builds a simplicial complex given a cover of a space by subsets. While successful, these have limitations: geometric complexes scale poorly with data size, and Mapper graphs can be hard to tune and only contain low dimensional information. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of learning covers in its own right, and from the perspective of optimization. We describe a method for learning topologically-faithful covers of geometric datasets, and show that the simplicial complexes thus obtained can outperform standard topological inference approaches in terms of size, and Mapper-type algorithms in terms of representation of large-scale topology.</description>

      <title>Locally minimax optimal confidence sets for the best model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles a fundamental inference problem: given $n$ observations from a distribution $P$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ with unknown mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, we must form a confidence set for the index (or indices) corresponding to the smallest component of $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. By duality, we reduce this to testing, for each $r$ in $1,\ldots,d$, whether $\mu_r$ is the smallest. Based on the sample splitting and self-normalization approach of Kim and Ramdas (2024), we propose "dimension-agnostic" tests that maintain validity regardless of how $d$ scales with $n$, and regardless of arbitrary ties in $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. Notably, our validity holds under mild moment conditions, requiring little more than finiteness of a second moment, and permitting possibly strong dependence between coordinates. In addition, we establish the \emph{local} minimax separation rate for this problem, which adapts to the cardinality of a confusion set, and show that the proposed tests attain this rate. Furthermore, we develop robust variants that continue to achieve the same minimax rate under heavy-tailed distributions with only finite second moments. While these results highlight the theoretical strength of our method, a practical concern is that sample splitting can reduce finite-sample power. We show that this drawback can be substantially alleviated by the multi-split aggregation method of Guo and Shah (2025). Finally, empirical results on simulated and real data illustrate the strong performance of our approach in terms of type I error control and power compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Significativity Indices for Agreement Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agreement measures, such as Cohen's kappa or intraclass correlation, gauge the matching between two or more classifiers. They are used in a wide range of contexts from medicine, where they evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatments and clinical trials, to artificial intelligence, where they can quantify the approximation due to the reduction of a classifier. The consistency of different classifiers to a golden standard can be compared simply by using the order induced by their agreement measure with respect to the golden standard itself. Nevertheless, labelling an approach as good or bad exclusively by using the value of an agreement measure requires a scale or a significativity index. Some quality scales have been proposed in the literature for Cohen's kappa, but they are mainly na\"ive, and their boundaries are arbitrary. This work proposes a general approach to evaluate the significativity of any agreement value between two classifiers and introduces two significativity indices: one dealing with finite data sets, the other one handling classification probability distributions. Moreover, this manuscript addresses the computational challenges of evaluating such indices and proposes some efficient algorithms for their evaluation.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantifying the Hessian Structure of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical studies reported that the Hessian matrix of neural networks (NNs) exhibits a near-block-diagonal structure, yet its theoretical foundation remains unclear. In this work, we reveal that the reported Hessian structure comes from a mixture of two forces: a ``static force'' rooted in the architecture design, and a ''dynamic force'' arisen from training. We then provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of ''static force'' at random initialization. We study linear models and 1-hidden-layer networks for classification tasks with $C$ classes. By leveraging random matrix theory, we compare the limit distributions of the diagonal and off-diagonal Hessian blocks and find that the block-diagonal structure arises as $C$ becomes large. Our findings reveal that $C$ is one primary driver of the near-block-diagonal structure. These results may shed new light on the Hessian structure of large language models (LLMs), which typically operate with a large $C$ exceeding $10^4$.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Convergence of Score-based Generative Models under Semiconvexity and Discontinuous Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) approximate a data distribution by perturbing it with Gaussian noise and subsequently denoising it via a learned reverse diffusion process. These models excel at modeling complex data distributions and generating diverse samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance across domains such as computer vision, audio generation, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. Despite their empirical success, existing Wasserstein-2 convergence analysis typically assume strong regularity conditions-such as smoothness or strict log-concavity of the data distribution-that are rarely satisfied in practice. In this work, we establish the first non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs targeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients. Our upper bounds are explicit and sharp in key parameters, achieving optimal dependence of $O(\sqrt{d})$ on the data dimension $d$ and convergence rate of order one. The framework accommodates a wide class of practically relevant distributions, including symmetric modified half-normal distributions, Gaussian mixtures, double-well potentials, and elastic net potentials. By leveraging semiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions on the potential such as differentiability, our results substantially broaden the theoretical foundations of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous guarantees in non-smooth, complex data regimes.</description>

      <title>Minimax Adaptive Online Nonparametric Regression over Besov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study online adversarial regression with convex losses against a rich class of continuous yet highly irregular prediction rules, modeled by Besov spaces $B\_{pq}^s$ with general parameters $1 \leq p,q \leq \infty$ and smoothness $s &gt; \tfrac{d}{p}$. We introduce an adaptive wavelet-based algorithm that performs sequential prediction without prior knowledge of $(s,p,q)$, and establish minimax-optimal regret bounds against any comparator in $B\_{pq}^s$. We further design a locally adaptive extension capable of dynamically tracking spatially inhomogeneous smoothness. This adaptive mechanism adjusts the resolution of the predictions over both time and space, yielding refined regret bounds in terms of local regularity. Consequently, in heterogeneous environments, our adaptive guarantees can significantly surpass those obtained by standard global methods.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Feature Scaling In Machine Learning: Effects on Regression and Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research addresses the critical lack of comprehensive studies on feature scaling by systematically evaluating 12 scaling techniques - including several less common transformations - across 14 different Machine Learning algorithms and 16 datasets for classification and regression tasks. We meticulously analyzed impacts on predictive performance (using metrics such as accuracy, MAE, MSE, and $R^2$) and computational costs (training time, inference time, and memory usage). Key findings reveal that while ensemble methods (such as Random Forest and gradient boosting models like XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM) demonstrate robust performance largely independent of scaling, other widely used models such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, TabNet, and MLPs show significant performance variations highly dependent on the chosen scaler. This extensive empirical analysis, with all source code, experimental results, and model parameters made publicly available to ensure complete transparency and reproducibility, offers model-specific crucial guidance to practitioners on the need for an optimal selection of feature scaling techniques.</description>

      <title>Power-Dominance in Estimation Theory: A Third Pathological Axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation theory by introducing a second-order diagnostic for estimator design. While classical analysis focuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational constraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for both parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power regimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the `power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty, making it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a `safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps. One map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating characteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone corresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden `power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This framework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing new theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design philosophies.</description>

      <title>Rate doubly robust estimation for weighted average treatment effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted average treatment effect (WATE) defines a versatile class of causal estimands for populations characterized by propensity score weights, including the average treatment effect (ATE), treatment effect on the treated (ATT), on controls (ATC), and for the overlap population (ATO). WATE has broad applicability in social and medical research, as many datasets from these fields align with its framework. However, the literature lacks a systematic investigation into the robustness and efficiency conditions for WATE estimation. Although doubly robust (DR) estimators are well-studied for ATE, their applicability to other WATEs remains uncertain. This paper investigates whether widely used WATEs admit DR or rate doubly robust (RDR) estimators and assesses the role of nuisance function accuracy, particularly with machine learning. Using semiparametric efficient influence function (EIF) theory and double/debiased machine learning (DML), we propose three RDR estimators under specific rate and regularity conditions and evaluate their performance via Monte Carlo simulations. Applications to NHANES data on smoking and blood lead levels, and SIPP data on 401(k) eligibility, demonstrate the methods' practical relevance in medical and social sciences.</description>
