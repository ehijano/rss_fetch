      <title>A Unified Model for Cardinality Estimation by Learning from Data and Queries via Sum-Product Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental component in database systems, crucial for generating efficient execution plans. Despite advancements in learning-based cardinality estimation, existing methods may struggle to simultaneously optimize the key criteria: estimation accuracy, inference time, and storage overhead, limiting their practical applicability in real-world database environments. This paper introduces QSPN, a unified model that integrates both data distribution and query workload. QSPN achieves high estimation accuracy by modeling data distribution using the simple yet effective Sum-Product Network (SPN) structure. To ensure low inference time and reduce storage overhead, QSPN further partitions columns based on query access patterns. We formalize QSPN as a tree-based structure that extends SPNs by introducing two new node types: QProduct and QSplit. This paper studies the research challenges of developing efficient algorithms for the offline construction and online computation of QSPN. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate QSPN in both single-table and multi-table cardinality estimation settings. The experimental results have demonstrated that QSPN achieves superior and robust performance on the three key criteria, compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Crypto Tokens: The Illusion of Decentralized AI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the emergence of AI-based tokens, which are cryptographic assets designed to power decentralized AI platforms and services. This paper provides a comprehensive review of leading AI-token projects, examining their technical architectures, token utilities, consensus mechanisms, and underlying business models. We explore how these tokens operate across various blockchain ecosystems and assess the extent to which they offer value beyond traditional centralized AI services. Based on this assessment, our analysis identifies several core limitations. From a technical perspective, many platforms depend extensively on off-chain computation, exhibit limited capabilities for on-chain intelligence, and encounter significant scalability challenges. From a business perspective, many models appear to replicate centralized AI service structures, simply adding token-based payment and governance layers without delivering truly novel value. In light of these challenges, we also examine emerging developments that may shape the next phase of decentralized AI systems. These include approaches for on-chain verification of AI outputs, blockchain-enabled federated learning, and more robust incentive frameworks. Collectively, while emerging innovations offer pathways to strengthen decentralized AI ecosystems, significant gaps remain between the promises and the realities of current AI-token implementations. Our findings contribute to a growing body of research at the intersection of AI and blockchain, highlighting the need for critical evaluation and more grounded approaches as the field continues to evolve.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Reproducible Biomedical Question Answering using Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical question-answering (QA) systems require effective retrieval and generation components to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. This study systematically examines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for biomedical QA, evaluating retrieval strategies and response time trade-offs. We first assess state-of-the-art retrieval methods, including BM25, BioBERT, MedCPT, and a hybrid approach, alongside common data stores such as Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and FAISS, on a ~10% subset of PubMed (2.4M documents) to measure indexing efficiency, retrieval latency, and retriever performance in the end-to-end RAG system. Based on these insights, we deploy the final RAG system on the full 24M PubMed corpus, comparing different retrievers' impact on overall performance. Evaluations of the retrieval depth show that retrieving 50 documents with BM25 before reranking with MedCPT optimally balances accuracy (0.90), recall (0.90), and response time (1.91s). BM25 retrieval time remains stable (82ms), while MedCPT incurs the main computational cost. These results highlight previously not well-known trade-offs in retrieval depth, efficiency, and scalability for biomedical QA. With open-source code, the system is fully reproducible and extensible.</description>

      <title>Information Leakage in Data Linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of linking databases that contain sensitive information about individuals across organisations is an increasingly common requirement in the health and social science research domains, as well as with governments and businesses. To protect personal data, protocols have been developed to limit the leakage of sensitive information. Furthermore, privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) techniques have been proposed to conduct linkage on encoded data. While PPRL techniques are now being employed in real-world applications, the focus of PPRL research has been on the technical aspects of linking sensitive data (such as encoding methods and cryptanalysis attacks), but not on organisational challenges when employing such techniques in practice. We analyse what sensitive information can possibly leak, either unintentionally or intentionally, in traditional data linkage as well as PPRL protocols, and what a party that participates in such a protocol can learn from the data it obtains legitimately within the protocol. We also show that PPRL protocols can still result in the unintentional leakage of sensitive information. We provide recommendations to help data custodians and other parties involved in a data linkage project to identify and prevent vulnerabilities and make their project more secure.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Resilience Problems via Valued Constraint Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15654v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) constitute a large class of computational optimisation problems. It was shown recently that, over finite domains, every VCSP is in P or NP-complete, depending on the admitted cost functions. In this article, we study cost functions over countably infinite domains whose automorphisms form an oligomorphic permutation group. Our results include a hardness condition based on a generalisation of pp-constructability as known from classical CSPs and a polynomial-time tractability condition based on the concept of fractional polymorphisms. We then observe that the resilience problem for unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs) studied in database theory, under bag semantics, may be viewed as a special case of the VCSPs that we consider. We obtain a complexity dichotomy for the case of incidence-acyclic UCQs and exemplarily use our methods to determine the complexity of a conjunctive query that has been stated as an open problem in the literature. We conjecture that our hardness and tractability conditions match for resilience problems for UCQs. Further, we obtain a complete dichotomy for resilience problems for two-way regular path queries, under bag semantics.</description>

      <title>A Protocol for KG Construction Tasks Involving Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graph construction (KGC) from (semi-)structured data is challenging, and facilitating user involvement is an issue frequently brought up within this community. We cannot deny the progress we have made with respect to (declarative) knowledge graph construction languages and tools to help build such mappings. However, it is surprising that no two studies report on similar protocols. This heterogeneity does not allow for comparing KGC languages, techniques, and tools. This paper first analyses studies involving users to identify the points of comparison. These gaps include a lack of systematic consistency in task design, participant selection, and evaluation metrics. Moreover, there needs to be a systematic way of analyzing the data and reporting the findings, which is also lacking. We thus propose and introduce a user protocol for KGC designed to address this challenge. Where possible, we draw and take elements from the literature we deem fit for such a protocol. The protocol, as such, allows for the comparison of languages and techniques for the RDF Mapping Language (RML) core functionality, which is covered by most of the other state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We also propose how the protocol can be amended to compare extensions (of RML). This protocol provides an important step towards a more comparable evaluation of KGC user studies.</description>

      <title>Perception-aware Sampling for Scatterplot Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualizing data is often a crucial first step in data analytics workflows, but growing data sizes pose challenges due to computational and visual perception limitations. As a result, data analysts commonly down-sample their data and work with subsets. Deriving representative samples, however, remains a challenge. This paper focuses on scatterplots, a widely-used visualization type, and introduces a novel sampling objective -- perception-awareness -- aiming to improve sample efficacy by targeting humans' perception of a visualization.
  We make the following contributions: (1) We propose perception-augmented databases and design PAwS: a novel perception-aware sampling method for scatterplots that leverages saliency maps -- a computer vision tool for predicting areas of attention focus in visualizations -- and models perception-awareness via saliency, density, and coverage objectives. (2) We design ApproPAwS: a fast, perception-aware method for approximate visualizations, which exploits the fact that small visual perturbations are often imperceptible to humans. (3) We introduce the concept of perceptual similarity as a metric for sample quality, and present a novel method that compares saliency maps to measure it. (4) Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our methods consistently outperform prior art in producing samples with high perceptual similarity, while ApproPAwS achieves up to 100x speed-ups with minimal loss in visual fidelity. Our user study shows that PAwS is often preferred by humans, validating our quantitative findings.</description>
