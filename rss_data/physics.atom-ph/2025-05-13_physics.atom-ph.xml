      <title>Sub-Recoil Transverse Momentum Width in a Cold Ytterbium Atomic Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generation of a slow ytterbium atomic beam with a transverse momentum width of $0.44(6)$ times the photon recoil associated with Bragg diffraction, and a flux of $6.7(9) \times 10^6$ atoms/s. This is achieved by applying momentum filtering through a long-lived metastable state to atoms prepared in a slow beam via two-dimensional transverse laser cooling. The resulting narrow momentum distribution enables efficient quasi-Bragg diffraction, which we exploit to realize a Bragg interferometer. These results mark a significant step toward continuous, high-precision, and magnetically insensitive angular rate measurements using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atomic beams.</description>

      <title>Comparison of laser system designs for quantum technologies: BECCAL flight system vs. BECCAL ground test bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of laser systems for the Bose-Einstein Condensate and Cold Atom Laboratory (BECCAL) payload, enabling numerous quantum technological experiments onboard the International Space Station (ISS), in particular dual species 87Rb and 41K Bose-Einstein condensates. A flight model (FM) and a commercial off the shelf (COTS) based model are shown, both of which meet the BECCAL requirements in terms of functionality, but have differing size, weight and power (SWaP) and environmental requirements. The capabilities of both models are discussed and characteristics compared. The flight model of BECCAL uses specifically developed and qualified custom components to create a compact and robust system suitable for long-term remote operation onboard the ISS. This system is based on ECDL-MOPA lasers and free-space optical benches made of Zerodur, as well as commercial fibre components. The COTS-based system utilizes entirely commercial parts to create a functionally equivalent system for operation in a standard laboratory, without the strict SWaP and environmental constraints of the flight model.</description>

      <title>Observation of high partial-wave Feshbach resonances in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the new observation of several high partial-wave (HPW) magnetic Feshbach resonances (FRs) in $^{39}$K atoms of the hyperfine substate $\left|F=1,m_{F}=-1\right\rangle$. These resonances locate at the region between two broad $s$-wave FRs from 32.6 G to 162.8 G, in which Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can be produced with tunable positive scattering length obtained by magnetic FRs. These HPW FRs are induced by the dipolar spin-spin interaction with s-wave in the open channel and HPW in the closed channel. Therefore, these HPW FRs have distinct characteristics in temperature dependence and loss line shape from that induced by spin-exchange interaction with HPWs in both open and closed channels. Among these resonances, one $d$-wave and two $g$-wave FRs are confirmed by the multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT) calculation. The HPW FRs have significant applications in many-body physics dominated by HPW pairing.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating axion mediated interactions in RaOH molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, they may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is interesting whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</description>

      <title>An algebraic solution of Dirac equation on a static curved space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Dirac equation in static curved space-time using two distinct algebraic approaches. The first method employs $su(1,1)$ algebra operators together with the tilting transformation, enabling the derivation of the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions for both the Hydrogen atom and the Dirac-Morse oscillator. The second approach, based on the Schr\"odinger factorization method, extends the analysis to three representative potentials: the hydrogen atom, the Dirac-Morse oscillator, and a linear radial potential. Although structurally different from those obtained in the first method, the resulting operators in this approach also close the $su(1,1)$ algebra and, through representation theory, yield the corresponding energy spectra and eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Extreme Loss Suppression and Wide Tunability of Dipolar Interactions in an Ultracold Molecular Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar molecules hold great promise for the creation of novel quantum states of matter, but the realization of long-lived molecular bulk samples with strong dipole-dipole interactions has remained elusive. Here, we realize a collisionally stable gas of ultracold ground state molecules with a lifetime of several seconds. Utilizing double microwave dressing, we achieve an extreme suppression of inelastic two- and three-body losses by factors of more than 10,000 and 1,000, respectively. We find that losses remain suppressed across a wide range of dipole-dipole interactions, allowing the continuous tuning of the dipolar length from 0 to 1 um $\sim$ 20,000 $a_0$. Combined with the recent realization of Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules, our findings open the door to the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum liquids.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing Using Cold Atoms and Molecules for Nuclear and Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technologies for manipulating single atoms and molecules have advanced drastically in the past decades. Due to their excellent controllability of internal states, atoms and molecules serves as one of the ideal platforms as quantum systems. One major research direction in atomic systems is the precise determination of energy differences between two energy levels in atoms. This field, known as precision measurement, is symbolized by the remarkable fractional uncertainty of $10^{-18}$ or lower achieved in the state-of-the-art atomic clocks. Two-level systems in atoms are sensitive to various external fields and can therefore be function as quantum sensors. The effect of these fields manifests as energy shifts in the two-level system. Traditionally, such shifts are induced by electric or magnetic fields, as recognized even before the advent of the precision spectroscopy with lasers. However, with high-precision measurements, energy shifts can also be caused by hypothetical fields weakly coupled to ordinary matter, or by small effects mediated by massive particles, which are conventionally dealt with in the field of nuclear and particle physics. In most cases, the atomic systems as quantum sensors have not been sensitive enough to detect such effects. Instead, experiments searching for these interactions have placed constraints on coupling constants, except in a few cases where effects are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Nonetheless, measurements and searches for these effects in atomic systems have led to the emergence of a new field of physics. In some cases, they open new parameter spaces to explore in conventionally investigated topics, e.g., dark matter, fifth force, CP-violation, and other physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Interleaved dual-species arrays of single atoms using a passive optical element and one trapping laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate trapping of individual rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms in an interleaved array of bright tweezers and dark bottle-beam traps, using a microfabricated optical element illuminated by a single laser beam and a 4F system with spatial filtering. Our approach exploits the opposite-sign dynamic polarizabilities of Rb and Cs, ensuring each species is exclusively trapped in either bright or dark sites. The passive optical mask creates optimal trap depths for both species using three transmittance levels while minimizing the optical phase difference, implemented using a variable-thickness absorbing layer of amorphous germanium. This trapping architecture achieves atom loading rates close to 50% while reducing system complexity compared to conventional methods using active optoelectronic components and/or multiple laser wavelengths.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Formulation for Defining the SI Second Based on Multiple Atomic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic transitions employed in the best of today's optical clocks are a strong foundation for the upcoming redefinition of the SI second. Including multiple transitions in the definition offers increased accuracy, a robust diversity of implementations and would drive continuous performance validation through frequency comparisons. The cost is that such a definition is more complex to articulate and feared to be challenging to implement. We show that it can be made more approachable to intuition, illustration and implementation through formulating this ensemble definition of the SI second in terms of the weighted arithmetic mean of normalized atomic transition frequencies. This definition produces the same results as the presently discussed option up to second order terms of order 10^-30 or below.</description>

      <title>Observation of generalized t-J spin dynamics with tunable dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions profoundly modify the dynamics of particles hopping in a periodic lattice potential. We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes that are challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods.</description>
