      <title>Multi-hop Parallel Image Semantic Communication for Distortion Accumulation Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing semantic communication schemes primarily focus on single-hop scenarios, overlooking the challenges of multi-hop wireless image transmission. As semantic communication is inherently lossy, distortion accumulates over multiple hops, leading to significant performance degradation. To address this, we propose the multi-hop parallel image semantic communication (MHPSC) framework, which introduces a parallel residual compensation link at each hop against distortion accumulation. To minimize the associated transmission bandwidth overhead, a coarse-to-fine residual compression scheme is designed. A deep learning-based residual compressor first condenses the residuals, followed by the adaptive arithmetic coding (AAC) for further compression. A residual distribution estimation module predicts the prior distribution for the AAC to achieve fine compression performances. This approach ensures robust multi-hop image transmission with only a minor increase in transmission bandwidth. Experimental results confirm that MHPSC outperforms both existing semantic communication and traditional separated coding schemes.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Chemotaxis Distortion Function from Cellular Decision Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular intelligence enables cells to process environmental signals and make context-dependent decisions, as exemplified by chemotaxis, where cells navigate chemical gradients despite noisy signaling pathways. To investigate how cells deal with uncertainty, we apply an information-theoretic framework based on rate distortion theory (RDT). The Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA) computes optimal decision strategies that minimize mutual information while satisfying distortion constraints, balancing sensing accuracy with distortion constraint equivalent to resource cost. We propose the inverse Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (IBAA) to compute the distortion function, which quantifies the system's decision-making criteria for realizing a decision strategy to map input signals to outputs. This general framework extends beyond chemotaxis to biological and engineered systems requiring efficient information processing under uncertainty. We validate the proposed IBAA by accurately estimating theoretical distortion functions in a cellular apoptosis scenario. Additionally, using the local excitation global inhibition (LEGI) model to simulate chemotactic responses, we compute the distortion functions from the cell's perspective. Our finding reveals a state-dependent decision criteria by the cell.</description>

      <title>Multilevel constructions of constant dimension codes based on one-factorization of complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constant dimension codes (CDCs) have become an important object in coding theory due to their application in random network coding. The multilevel construction is one of the most effective ways to construct constant dimension codes. The paper is devoted to constructing CDCs by the multilevel construction. Precisely, we first choose an appropriate skeleton code based on the transformations of binary vectors related to the one-factorization of complete graphs; then we construct CDCs by using the chosen skeleton code, where quasi-pending blocks are used; finally, we calculate the dimensions by use of known constructions of optimal Ferrers diagram rank metric codes. As applications, we improve the lower bounds of $\overline{A}_q(n,8,6)$ for $16\leq n\leq 19.$</description>

      <title>Secure Communication in the Presence of an RIS-Enhanced Eavesdropper in MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pay our attention towards secure and robust communication in the presence of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced mobile eavesdropping attacker in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)wireless networks.Specifically,we first provide a unifying framework that generalizes specific intelligent wiretap model wherein the passive eavesdropper configured with any number of antennas is potentially mobile and can actively optimize its received signal strength with the help of RIS by intelligently manipulating wiretap channel characteristics.To effectively mitigate this intractable threat,we then propose a novel and lightweight secure communication scheme from the perspective of information theory.The main idea is that the data processing can in some cases be observed as communication channel,and a random bit-flipping scheme is then carefully involved for the legitimate transmitter to minimize the mutual information between the secret message and the passive eavesdropper's received data.The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based precoding strategy is also implemented to optimize power allocation,and thus ensure that the legitimate receiver is not subject to interference from this random bit-flipping.The corresponding results depict that our secure communication scheme is practically desired, which does not require any a prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's full instantaneous Channel State Information (ICSI). Furthermore,we consider the RIS optimization problem from the eavesdropper's perspective,and provide RIS phase shift design solutions under different attacking scenarios.Finally,the optimal detection schemes respectively for the legitimate user and the eavesdropper are provided,and comprehensive simulations are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness and robustness of our secure communication scheme across a wide range of attacking scenarios.</description>

      <title>Byzantine Attacks in RIS-Enhanced Cooperative Spectrum Sensing: A Decision Fusion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of hard decision fusion, we investigate Byzantine attacks in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced and decode-and-forward relay-assisted Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) for mobile Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) in this paper. Specially, a RIS-enhanced and decode-and-forward relay-assisted CSS configuration is first constructed under dynamic channel scenarios due to user mobility. Subsequently, the channel- and attack-aware hard decision fusion rules are developed, and the optimal channel-aware Byzantine attack strategies are then developed under both small-scale and large-scale attacking scenarios. The corresponding results depict that the optimal attack strategy does not require any a prior knowledge of the global instantaneous Channel State Information (ICSI) (e.g. false alarm probability and detection probability of all the secondary users), although perfect acquisition of ICSI is clearly always not affordable from the attacker perspective, which is further exacerbated by the RIS and decode-and-forward relays involved in CSS and the potential high mobility of secondary users that leads to fast fading channels. Furthermore, our counterintuitive results also indicate that, regardless of the attacker's awareness of the decision fusion rule, the optimal Byzantine attack can be achieved through a unifying framework, the explicit attack strategy may be not unique, and the attacking effectiveness is primarily determined by the fraction of the Byzantine nodes rather than the channel dynamics. That is, to make the channel-aware approach more practical, the challenge that the heavy reliance on the global ICSI and decision fusion rule in obtaining the Byzantine attacks is successfully relaxed. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analysis through extensive simulations across a wide range of attacking scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dual-Scale Antenna Deployment for Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dual-scale deployment (DSD) framework for pinching antenna systems (PASS) is proposed. 1) In the first coarse stage, the pinching antenna (PA) is transferred over a large-scale range at the waveguide level. 2) The refinement stage performs small-scale relocation of the PA with high precision. Four PA deployment protocols are provided in the proposed DSD framework. Then, a practical power consumption model is proposed, based on which the theoretical energy efficiency formulas for PASS are derived. The transmit precoding, PA radiation power, and PA deployment are jointly optimized to maximize the energy efficiency under the provided PA deployment protocols. To solve this non-convex, highly coupled problem, a low-complexity penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of theoretical results and the convergence of the proposed algorithm. It is demonstrated that: 1) PASS delivers about 70% higher energy efficiency than the conventional cell-free architecture and nearly twofold improvement relative to MIMO systems; 2) it is essential to specify the DSD resolution and deployment protocol to achieve the maximum energy efficiency for PASS.</description>

      <title>Cross-Band Channel Impulse Response Prediction: Leveraging 3.5 GHz Channels for Upper Mid-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate cross-band channel prediction is essential for 6G networks, particularly in the upper mid-band (FR3, 7--24 GHz), where penetration loss and blockage are severe. Although ray tracing (RT) provides high-fidelity modeling, it remains computationally intensive, and high-frequency data acquisition is costly. To address these challenges, we propose CIR-UNext, a deep learning framework designed to predict 7 GHz channel impulse responses (CIRs) by leveraging abundant 3.5 GHz CIRs. The framework integrates an RT-based dataset pipeline with attention U-Net (AU-Net) variants for gain and phase prediction. The proposed AU-Net-Aux model achieves a median gain error of 0.58 dB and a phase prediction error of 0.27 rad on unseen complex environments. Furthermore, we extend CIR-UNext into a foundation model, Channel2ComMap, for throughput prediction in MIMO-OFDM systems, demonstrating superior performance compared with existing approaches. Overall, CIR-UNext provides an efficient and scalable solution for cross-band prediction, enabling applications such as localization, beam management, digital twins, and intelligent resource allocation in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Weight Enumerators From Equivalence Relations and MacWilliams Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider codes over finite fields, finite abelian groups, and finite Frobenius rings. For such codes, the complete weight enumerator and the Hamming weight enumerator serve as powerful tools. These two types of weight enumerators satisfy the MacWilliams relations. We define the weight enumerator of a code with respect to an equivalence relation and determine in which cases the MacWilliams relations hold for this weight enumerator. We also study some weight enumerators for specific equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Superdirectivity in Planar Holographic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the superdirectivity characteristics of uniform rectangular arrays (URAs) for holographic multiple-input multiple-output systems. By establishing a mathematical directivity model for the URA, an analytical expression for the maximum directivity is derived. Accordingly, systematic analysis is performed in conjunction with numerical simulations. Results show that the directivity can be significantly enhanced via rational utilization of coupling effects. However, this enhancement yields diminishing returns when antenna spacings transition to deep sub-wavelength scales. This study provides a theoretical basis for the design of superdirective URAs and offers valuable insights for holographic array optimization in 5G/6G communication systems.</description>

      <title>Broken-Token: Filtering Obfuscated Prompts by Counting Characters-Per-Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks where malicious prompts are disguised using ciphers and character-level encodings to bypass safety guardrails. While these guardrails often fail to interpret the encoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful instructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with negligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to mitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that tokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text, such as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our technique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the average number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is motivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules such as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a large dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with several popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT threshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very short inputs. CPT-Filtering provides a practical defense layer that can be immediately deployed for real-time text filtering and offline data curation.</description>

      <title>Towards a Measure of Algorithm Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on algorithm similarity.</description>

      <title>Unlimited Sampling of Multiband Signals: Single-Channel Acquisition and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing multiband signals from modulo-folded, pointwise samples within the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF). Focusing on a low-complexity, single-channel acquisition setup, we establish recovery guarantees demonstrating that sub-Nyquist sampling is achievable under the USF paradigm. In doing so, we also tighten the previous sampling theorem for bandpass signals. Our recovery algorithm demonstrates up to a 13x dynamic range improvement in hardware experiments with up to 6 spectral bands. These results enable practical high-dynamic-range multiband acquisition in scenarios previously limited by dynamic range and excessive oversampling.</description>

      <title>The Demon Hidden Behind Life's Ultra-Energy-Efficient Information Processing -- Demonstrated by Biological Molecular Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has revealed the enormous energy demands of modern digital architectures, raising deep concerns about sustainability. In stark contrast, the human brain operates efficiently on only ~20 watts, and individual cells process gigabit-scale genetic information using energy on the order of trillionths of a watt. Under the same energy budget, a general-purpose digital processor can perform only a few simple operations per second. This striking disparity suggests that biological systems follow algorithms fundamentally distinct from conventional computation. The framework of information thermodynamics-especially Maxwell's demon and the Szilard engine-offers a theoretical clue, setting the lower bound of energy required for information processing. However, digital processors exceed this limit by about six orders of magnitude. Recent single-molecule studies have revealed that biological molecular motors convert Brownian motion into mechanical work, realizing a "demon-like" operational principle. These findings suggest that living systems have already implemented an ultra-efficient information-energy conversion mechanism that transcends digital computation. Here, we experimentally establish a quantitative correspondence between positional information (bits) and mechanical work, demonstrating that molecular machines selectively exploit rare but functional fluctuations arising from Brownian motion to achieve ATP-level energy efficiency. This integration of information, energy, and timescale indicates that life realizes a Maxwell's demon-like mechanism for energy-efficient information processing.</description>

      <title>UNILocPro: Unified Localization Integrating Model-Based Geometry and Channel Charting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified localization framework (called UNILocPro) that integrates model-based localization and channel charting (CC) for mixed line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. Specifically, based on LoS/NLoS identification, an adaptive activation between the model-based and CC-based methods is conducted. Aiming for unsupervised learning, information obtained from the model-based method is utilized to train the CC model, where a pairwise distance loss (involving a new dissimilarity metric design), a triplet loss (if timestamps are available), a LoS-based loss, and an optimal transport (OT)-based loss are jointly employed such that the global geometry can be well preserved. To reduce the training complexity of UNILocPro, we propose a low-complexity implementation (called UNILoc), where the CC model is trained with self-generated labels produced by a single pre-training OT transformation, which avoids iterative Sinkhorn updates involved in the OT-based loss computation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed unified frameworks achieve significantly improved positioning accuracy compared to both model-based and CC-based methods. Notably, UNILocPro with timestamps attains performance on par with fully-supervised fingerprinting despite operating without labelled training data. It is also shown that the low-complexity UNILoc can substantially reduce training complexity with only marginal performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Packet Routing for Ultra-Dense LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of ultra-dense LEO constellations creates a complex and asynchronous network environment, driven by their massive scale, dynamic topologies, and significant delays. This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing algorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse and often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However, existing methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on impractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To tackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing framework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on its own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case performance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved by enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS objectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO constellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively optimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious baseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms end-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by resolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion avoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust routing.</description>

      <title>Downlink Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for LEO Satellite Mega-Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has emerged as a promising technology to improve wireless connectivity in global areas. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), an architecture proposed for next-generation networks, has yet to be fully explored for LEO satellites. In this paper, we investigate the downlink performance of a CF-mMIMO LEO SatCom network, where multiple satellite access points (SAPs) simultaneously serve the corresponding ground user terminals (UTs). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of SAPs and UTs on surfaces of concentric spheres using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and present expressions on transmit and received signals, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Then, we derive the coverage probabilities in fading scenarios, considering significant system parameters such as the Nakagami fading parameter, the number of UTs, the number of SAPs, the orbital altitude, and the service range affected by the dome angle. Finally, the analytical model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results indicate that stronger line-of-sight (LoS) effects and a more comprehensive service range of the UT result in a higher coverage probability, despite the presence of multi-user interference (MUI). Moreover, we found that there exist optimal numbers of UTs that maximize system capacity for different orbital altitudes and dome angles, providing valuable insights for system design.</description>

      <title>Testing and estimation in orthosymmetric Gaussian sequence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16734v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian sequence model, i.e. $X \sim N(\mathbf{\theta}, I_\infty)$, where $\mathbf{\theta} \in \Gamma \subset \ell_2$ is assumed to be convex and compact. We show that goodness-of-fit testing sample complexity is lower bounded by the square-root of the estimation complexity, whenever $\Gamma$ is orthosymmetric. This lower bound is tight when $\Gamma$ is also quadratically convex (as shown by [Donoho et al. 1990, Neykov 2023]). We also completely characterize likelihood-free hypothesis testing (LFHT) complexity for $\ell_p$-bodies, discovering new types of tradeoff between the numbers of simulation and observation samples, compared to the case of ellipsoids (p = 2) studied in [Gerber and Polyanskiy 2024].</description>

      <title>Practical hybrid decoding scheme for parity-encoded spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a practical hybrid decoding scheme for the parity-encoding architecture. This architecture was first introduced by N. Sourlas as a computational technique for tackling hard optimization problems, especially those modeled by spin systems such as the Ising model and spin glasses, and reinvented by W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller to develop quantum annealing devices. We study the specific model, called the SLHZ model, aiming to achieve a near-term quantum annealing device implemented solely through geometrically local spin interactions. Taking account of the close connection between the SLHZ model and a classical low-density-parity-check code, two approaches can be chosen for the decoding: (1) finding the ground state of a spin Hamiltonian derived from the SLHZ model, which can be achieved via stochastic decoders such as quantum annealing or classical Monte Carlo samplers; (2) using deterministic decoding techniques for the classical LDPC code, such as belief propagation and bit-flip decoder. The proposed hybrid approach combines the two approaches by applying bit-flip decoding to the readout of the stochastic decoder based on the SLHZ model. We present simulations demonstrating that this approach can reveal the latent potential of the SLHZ model, realizing soft-annealing concept proposed by Sourlas.</description>
