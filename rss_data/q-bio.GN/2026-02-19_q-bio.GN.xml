      <title>Parameter-free representations outperform single-cell foundation models on downstream benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data.</description>

      <title>Integrating Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval Augmented Generation Enhances Rare Disease Diagnosis from Clinical Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.</description>
