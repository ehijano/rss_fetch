      <title>Quasi-potential of stationary and quasi-stationary densities: existence, regularity, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the large deviation principle (LDP), with particular emphasis on the regularity of the quasi-potential for densities of stationary and quasi-stationary distributions of randomly perturbed dynamical systems. Our framework is set up within a positively invariant set contained in the basin of attraction of a maximal attractor of the unperturbed system. Such a setting with a general maximal attractor is anticipated in many applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic stability of physical measures in conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the significance of physical measures in understanding the complexity of dynamical systems as well as the noisy nature of real-world systems, investigating the stability of physical measures under noise perturbations is undoubtedly a fundamental issue in both theory and practice.
  The present paper is devoted to the stochastic stability of physical measures for conservative systems on a smooth, connected, and closed Riemannian manifold. It is assumed that a conservative system admits an invariant measure with a positive and mildly regular density. Our findings affirm, in particular, that such an invariant measure has strong stochastic stability whenever it is physical, that is, for a large class of small random perturbations, the density of this invariant measure is the zero-noise limit in $L^{1}$ of the densities of unique stationary measures of corresponding randomly perturbed systems. Stochastic stability in a stronger sense is obtained under additional assumptions. Examples are constructed to demonstrate that stochastic stability could occur even if the invariant measure is non-physical. The high non-triviality of constructing such examples asserts the sharpness of the stochastic stability conclusion. Similar results are established for conservative systems on bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Factorization of the quadratic Misiurewicz-Thurston polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note provides the complete factorization of the Misiurewicz-Thurston polynomial $q_{\ell,n}=p_{\ell+n}(z) - p_\ell(z)$ over $\mathbb{C}$, which plays a central role in the study of the Mandelbrot set, where \[ p_0(z) = 0, \qquad p_{n+1}(z) = p_n(z)^2 + z. \] The roots can be classified into two categories. First, there are hyperbolic points $\operatorname{hyp}(k)$ for any divisor $k$ of $n$, which are parameters whose critical orbits are of exact period $k$. Those are roots of $q_{\ell,n}$ with multiplicity $\left\lfloor \frac{\ell -1}{k} \right\rfloor + 2$. Next are the points $\operatorname{mis}(j,k)$ for $2\leq j\leq \ell$ whose critical orbits are pre-periodic of exact period $k$ with an exact pre-period $j$. Those are simple roots of $q_{\ell,n}$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic averages and the large intersection property along IP sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiple ergodic averages along IP sets, meaning we restrict iterates in the averages to all finite sums of some infinite sequence of natural numbers. We give criteria for convergence and divergence in mean of these multiple averages and derive sufficient conditions for convergence to the projection onto the space of invariant functions. For a class of sequences that, roughly speaking, only have rational obstructions to such a limit, we show that the behavior is controlled by nilsystems. We also consider pointwise convergence, obtaining convergence and a formula for a set of functions on nilsystems that are dense in $L^2$. Finally, we show that certain correlations have optimally large intersections along an IP set</description>

      <title>Maximum-likelihood reprojections for reliable Koopman-based predictions and bifurcation analysis of parametric dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman-based methods leverage a nonlinear lifting to enable linear regression techniques. Consequently, data generation, learning and prediction is performed through the lens of this lifting, giving rise to a nonlinear manifold that is invariant under the Koopman operator. In data-driven approximation such as Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition, this invariance is typically lost due to the presence of (finite-data) approximation errors. In this work, we show that reprojections are crucial for reliable predictions. We provide an approach via closest-point projections that ensure consistency with this nonlinear manifold, which is strongly related to a Riemannian metric and maximum likelihood estimates. While these results are already novel for autonomous systems, we present our approach for parametric systems, providing the basis for data-driven bifurcation analysis and control applications.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is studying the compact global attractors for non-autonomous lattice dynamical systems of the form $u_{i}'=\nu (u_{i-1}-2u_i+u_{i+1})-\lambda u_{i}+f(u_i)+f_{i}(t)\ (i\in \mathbb Z,\ \lambda &gt;0)$.

      <title>Finite energy foliations in the restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about using pseudo-holomorphic curves to study the circular planar restricted three-body problem. The main result states that for mass ratios sufficiently close to $\frac{1}{2}$ and energies slightly above the first Lagrange value, the flow on the regularized component $\mathbb R P^3 \# \mathbb R P^3$ of the energy surface admits a finite energy foliation with three binding orbits, namely two retrograde orbits around the primaries and the Lyapunov orbit in the neck region about the first Lagrange point. This foliation explains the numerically observed homoclinic orbits to the Lyapunov orbits. The critical energy surface is proved to satisfy the strict convexity condition in regularizing elliptic coordinates. This allows for the application of a general abstract result for Reeb vector fields on holed lens spaces, concerning the existence of finite energy foliations with prescribed binding orbits. As a by-product of the convex analysis, Birkhoff's retrograde orbit conjecture is proved for mass ratios sufficiently close to $\frac{1}{2}$ and all energies below the first Lagrange value. This conjecture states that the retrograde orbit bounds a disk-like global surface of section on each regularized component $\mathbb R P^3$ of the energy surface.</description>

      <title>Topological slow entropy, sequence entropy, and generalized $[T,T^{-1}]$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider topological dynamical systems given by skew products $S\rtimes_{\tau} T$, where $S\colon Y\to Y$ is a subshift, $\tau\colon Y\to\mathbb{Z}$ is a continuous cocycle, and $T$ is an arbitrary invertible topological system. For fixed $(Y,S,\tau)$ it may happen that all systems of the form $S\rtimes_\tau T$ have the same topological entropy, and thus it arises the problem of distinguishing two such systems.
  We show that if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are invertible topological dynamical systems with different topological entropy then $S\rtimes_{\tau} T_1$ and $S\rtimes_{\tau} T_1$ can be distinguished using slow entropy as introduced by Katok and Thouvenot. We prove a similar result under the assumption that the fiber systems have different slow entropy at some scale (this can be applied if $T_1$ and $T_2$ have both zero entropy, or have the same entropy). These results require rather mild assumptions on $(Y,S,\tau)$, and can be applied to some entropy-zero systems in the base.
  We generalize classical results in the theory of sequence entropy, which were proved by Goodman with the additional assumption of finite topological dimension. We show that the measure-theoretic sequence entropy of any system is bounded by its topological sequence entropy. Under an extra assumption on the sequence we establish a variational principle, and prove that the topological sequence entropy of a system equals its topological entropy multiplied by a positive constant that depends only on the sequence.</description>

      <title>Measures of Systems of Oscillators and Properties of Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of trajectories of systems of harmonic oscillators equipped with a point, absolutely continuous or singular measure are considered in this paper. Linear flow of an infinite system of oscillators on an infinite dimensional tori in the phase space are studied. It was shown in [28] that for infinite-dimensional linear flows of a countable system of oscillators there is a new type of trajectories that is not periodic and has no transitive projection on any 4-dimensional symplectic subspace. A trajectory with this property is absent in the finite-dimensional case, it is not typical for a countably system of oscillators and it is typical for a continual one. We show that any point of a non-degenerated invariant torus is non-wandering point of the flow of a countable system of harmonic oscillators. But a point of a non-degenerated invariant torus of a flow of continual system of harmonic oscillator with absolutely continuous measure is wandering point. For the continual system of oscillators with a singular measure we obtain sufficient conditions on measure and torus for absence of transitive trajectory and non-wandering points.</description>

      <title>Canard cycles of non-linearly regularized piecewise smooth vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to study limit cycles in non-linear regularizations of planar piecewise smooth systems with fold points (or more degenerate tangency points) and crossing regions. We deal with a slow fast Hopf point after non-linear regularization and blow-up. We give a simple criterion for upper bounds and the existence of limit cycles of canard type, expressed in terms of zeros of the slow divergence integral. Using the criterion we can construct a quadratic regularization of piecewise linear center such that for any integer $k&gt;0$ it has at least $k+1$ limit cycles, for a suitably chosen monotonic transition function $\varphi_k:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. We prove a similar result for regularized invisible-invisible fold-fold singularities of type II$_2$. Canard cycles of dodging layer are also considered, and we prove that such limit cycles undergo a saddle-node bifurcation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every $C^\infty$ diffeomorphism of a closed Riemannian manifold, if there exists a positive volume set of points which admit some expansion with a positive Lyapunov exponent (in a weak sense) then there exists an invariant probability measure with a disintegration by absolutely continuous conditionals on smoothly embedded disks subordinated to unstable leaves. As an application, we prove a strong version of Viana conjecture in any dimension, generalizing a recent result of the second author for surface diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Filtrations Indexed by Attracting Levels and their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a framework for constructing two types of filtrations with respect to a reference object akin to an attractor. The forward directions of the filtrations characterize the level of control required to approach the attractor. The negative directions of the filtrations capture the robustness of the ``basin'' by quantifying how much perturbations can be tolerated without altering the tendency to be attracted to a given attractor. Furthermore, to accommodate real-world phenomena, we consider dynamical systems not on metric spaces with discrete-time maps, but on sets endowed with a more general cost function, where the dynamics are governed by partial maps. To illustrate the generality of the proposed construction, we apply it to ensemble forecasts of a tropical cyclone. The filtrations capture regions of heightened sensitivity, where small perturbations induce qualitative changes in asymptotic behavior. This example substantiates the theoretical framework in a data-driven but structurally rich context, emphasizing its relevance for analyzing control and robustness in intricate dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: We study outer billiard systems around a class of circular sectors. For semi-discs, we prove the existence of elliptic islands occupying a positive proportion of the plane. Combined with known results, this shows the coexistence of stability and diffusion for this system.
  On the other hand, we show that there exists a countable family of circular sectors for which the outer billiard system has zero measure of escaping orbits.</description>

      <title>Dynamical covering sets in self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the size of \emph{dynamical covering sets} on a self-similar set. Dynamical covering sets are limsup sets generated by placing shrinking target sets around points along an orbit in a dynamical system. In the case when the target sets are balls with sizes depending on the centre, we determine the size of the dynamical covering set as a function of the shrinking rate. In particular, we find sharp conditions guaranteeing when full Dvoretzky-type covering, and full measure occur. We also compute the Hausdorff dimension in the remaining cases. The proofs apply in the cases of targets centred at typical points of the self-similar set, with respect to any Bernoulli measure on it. Unlike in existing work on dynamical coverings, and despite the dimension value featuring phase transitions, we demonstrate that the behaviour can be characterised by a single pressure function over the full range of parameters. The techniques are a combination of classical dimension theoretical estimates and intricate martingale arguments.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of polynomial maps on the boundary of the central hyperbolic component $\mathcal H_d$. We prove the local connectivity of Julia sets and a rigidity theorem for maps on the regular part of $\partial\mathcal H_d$. Our proof is based on the construction of Fatou trees and employs the puzzle technique as a key methodological framework. These results are applicable to a larger class of maps for which the maximal Fatou trees equal the filled Julia sets.</description>

      <title>Operator Splitting Methods: Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations via Separation of Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper applies the concept of linear semigroups induced by nonlinear flows, originally developed by Dorroh and Neuberger in the 1990s, to the approximation of uniquely solvable initial value problems for nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Building on a framework rooted in the earlier works of Lie, Kowalewski, and Groebner, we analyze nonlinear systems through the lens of the Koopman-Lie semigroup exp(tK), where K is the linear Lie generator associated with the flow induced by the nonlinear differential equation. A central feature of this approach is the decomposition K = K1 + ... + KN, which enables the use of operator splitting methods. We revisit the foundational first-order splitting scheme introduced by H. F. Trotter in 1959 and extend it to higher-order schemes with improved error bounds. These theoretical developments are supported by numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods, which are based entirely on the classical separation of variables technique for solving ordinary differential equations.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Reduction for Formal Synthesis of Global Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formal synthesis of global polynomial Lyapunov functions for polynomial vector fields. We establish that a sign-definite polynomial must satisfy specific algebraic constraints, which we leverage to develop a set of straightforward symbolic reduction rules. These rules can be recursively applied to symbolically simplify the Lyapunov candidate, enabling more efficient and robust discovery of Lyapunov functions via optimization or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving. In many cases, without such simplification, finding a valid Lyapunov function is often infeasible. When strict Lyapunov functions are unavailable, we design synthesis procedures for finding weak Lyapunov functions to verify global asymptotic stability using LaSalle's invariance principle. Finally, we encode instability conditions for Lyapunov functions and develop SMT procedures to disprove global asymptotic stability. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that the proposed symbolic reduction, LaSalle-type conditions, and instability tests allow us to efficiently solve many cases that would otherwise be challenging.</description>

      <title>Measuring Fractal Dimension using Discrete Global Grid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study builds a bridge between two well-studied but distant topics: fractal dimension and Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS). DGGSs are used as covering sets for geospatial vector data to calculate the Minkowski-Bouligand dimension. Using the method on synthetic data yields results within 1% of their theoretical fractal dimensions. A case study on opaque cloud fields obtained from satellite images gives fractal dimension in agreement with that available in the literature. The proposed method alleviates the problems of arbitrary grid placement and orientation, as well as the progression of cell sizes of the covering sets for geospatial data. Using DGGSs further ensure that intersections of the covering sets with the geospatial vector having large geographic extents are calculated by taking the curvature of the earth into account. This paper establishes the validity of DGGSs as covering sets theoretically and discusses desirable properties of DGGSs suitable for this purpose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aided by the tools and outlook provided by modern classification theory, we take a new look at the Brown-Voiculescu entropy of endomorphisms of nuclear C*-algebras. In particular, we introduce `coloured' versions of noncommutative topological entropy suitable for C*-algebras A of finite nuclear dimension or finite decomposition rank. In the latter case, assuming further that A is simple, separable, unital, satisfies the UCT and has finitely many extremal traces, we prove a variational type principle in terms of quasidiagonal approximations relative to this finite set of traces. Building on work of Kerr, we also show that infinite entropy occurs generically among endomorphisms and automorphisms of certain classifiable C*-algebras that function as noncommutative spaces of observables of topological manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the Maximization of Real Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a maximization problem on real sequences. More precisely, for a given sequence, we are interesting in computing the supremum of the sequence and an index for which the associated term is maximal. We propose a general methodology to solve this maximization problem. The method is based on upper approximations constructed from pairs of eventually decreasing sequences of strictly increasing continuous functions on $[0,1]$ and of scalars in $(0,1)$. Then, we can associate integers with those pairs using inverses on $[0,1]$ of the functions. We prove that such pairs always exist and one provides the index maximizer. In general, such pairs provide an upper bound of the greatest maximizer of the sequence. Finally, we apply the methodology on concrete examples including famous sequences such as logistic, Fibonacci and Syracuse sequences. We also apply our techniques to norm based peaks computation problems on discrete-time linear systems.</description>

      <title>Design, fabrication and control of a cable-driven parallel robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cable driven parallel robots (CDPRs), the payload is suspended using a network of cables whose length can be controlled to maneuver the payload within the workspace. Compared to rigid link robots, CDPRs provide better maneuverability due to the flexibility of the cables and consume lesser power due to the high strength-to-weight ratio of the cables. However, amongst other things, the flexibility of the cables and the fact that they can only pull (and not push) render the dynamics of CDPRs complex. Hence advanced modelling paradigms and control algorithms must be developed to fully utilize the potential of CDPRs. Furthermore, given the complex dynamics of CDPRs, the models and control algorithms proposed for them must be validated on experimental setups to ascertain their efficacy in practice. We have recently developed an elaborate experimental setup for a CDPR with three cables and validated elementary open-loop motion planning algorithms on it. In this paper, we describe several aspects of the design and fabrication of our setup, including component selection and assembly, and present our experimental results. Our setup can reproduce complex phenomenon such as the transverse vibration of the cables seen in large CDPRs and will in the future be used to model and control such phenomenon and also to validate more sophisticated motion planning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging quality requirements in modern optical systems increase the need for accurate simulation and compensation of disturbances. One key disturbance in high-power laser applications results from thermal loading due to absorption. This paper presents a flexible modeling approach for absorption based on ray tracing, where point heat sources are defined along ray paths. In addition, several methods for mapping these point heat sources along the ray path to the finite element mesh are introduced and compared. A major advantage of the proposed approach lies in its flexibility, as it enables the simulation of transient phenomena such as dynamic beam positioning and time-dependent variations in beam shape.</description>

Abstract: Given $r \geq 3$, we prove that there exists $\lambda &gt;0$ depending only on $r$ so that if $G$ is a metric graph of rank $r$ with metric entropy $1$, then there exists a proper subgraph $H$ of $G$ with metric entropy at least $\lambda$. This answers a question of the second two authors together with Rieck. We interpret this as a graph theoretic version of the Bers Lemma from hyperbolic geometry, and explain some connections to the pressure metric on the Culler-Vogtmann Outer Space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a general pressure gap criterion for closed rank 1 manifolds whose singular sets are given by codimension 1 totally geodesic flat subtori. As an application, we show that under certain curvature constraints, potentials that decay faster than geometric potentials (towards to the singular set) have pressure gaps and have no phase transitions. Along the way, we prove that geometric potentials are H\"older continuous near singular sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new relationship between monotonicity and contractivity and use this connection to describe a new general class of weakly contractive reaction networks. The new class is characterized by the stoichiometry matrix of the reaction network admitting a precise matrix factorization that can be verified computationally. Reaction networks in this class are weakly contractive, implying global convergence to equilibria under appropriate technical conditions. Furthermore, we describe the novel subclass of cross-polytope networks. We also show that our results provide a unified proof of global convergence for several classes of networks previously studied in the literature. The practical relevance of the results is demonstrated by examples from systems biology and signaling pathways.</description>

Abstract: Let M be a geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifold whose limit set is a round Sierpi\'nski gasket, i.e. M is geometrically finite and acylindrical with a compact, totally geodesic convex core boundary. In this paper, we classify orbit closures of the 1-dimensional horocycle flow on the frame bundle of M. As a result, the closure of a horocycle in M is a properly immersed submanifold. This extends the work of McMullen-Mohammadi-Oh where M is further assumed to be convex cocompact.</description>

Abstract: We show that the generator of a conservative IID random system whose dynamics expands on average codimension $1$ planes has an essential spectral radius strictly smaller than $1$ on Sobolev spaces of small positive index index. Consequently, such a system has finitely many ergodic components. If there is only one component for each power of the random system, then the system enjoys multiple exponential mixing and the central limit theorem. Moreover, these properties are stable under small perturbations. As an application we show that many small perturbations of random homogeneous systems are exponentially mixing.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of synchronized solutions in a continuum limit of the Kuramoto model with two-mode interaction depending on two graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bifurcations of the completely synchronized state in a continuum limit (CL) for the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators with two-mode interaction depending on two graphs. Here one of the graphs is uniform but may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse, and the other is a deterministic finite nearest neighbor. We use the center manifold reduction technique, which is a standard one in dynamical systems, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of completely synchronized state becomes unstable and a stable two-parameter family of $\ell$-humped sinusoidal shape stationary solutions ($\ell\ge 2$) appears, where $n$ represents the node number. This contrasts the author's recent result on the classical KM in which bifurcation behavior in its CL is very different from ones in the KM and difficult to explain by standard techniques in dynamical systems such as the center manifold reduction. Moreover, similar bifurcation behavior is shown to occur in the KM, based on the previous fundamental results. The occurrence of such bifurcations were suggested by numerical simulations for the deterministic graphs in a previous study. We also demonstrate our theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with the zero natural frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Kuramoto model (KM) having random natural frequencies and defined on uniform graphs that may be complete, random dense or random sparse. The natural frequencies are independent and identically distributed on a bounded interval. In the previous work, the corresponding continuum limit (CL) was proven to approximate stable motions in the KM well when the natural frequencies are deterministic, even if the graph is not uniform, although it may not do so for unstable motions and bifurcations. We show that the method of CLs is still valid even when the natural frequencies are random, especially uniformly distributed. In particular, an asymptotically stable family of solutions to the CL is proven to behave in the $L^2$ sense as if it is an asymptotically stable one in the KM, under an appropriate uniform random permutation. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with uniformly distributed random natural frequencies.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastic systems with almost surely invariant manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for establishing non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastically forced dynamical systems possessing an almost surely invariant submanifold. Our main abstract result provides sufficient conditions for the existence of multiple stationary measures on compact manifolds, though the underlying methodology extends to non-compact settings. The key insight is to construct additional stationary measures by exploiting the linear instability of the invariant submanifold, as quantified by a positive transverse Lyapunov exponent.
  To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we apply it to the Lorenz 96 model with degenerate stochastic forcing, which serves as an example of both non-compact and high-dimensional dynamics. We prove that as the damping parameter becomes sufficiently small, the unique stationary measure bifurcates, giving rise to exactly two distinct stationary measures. The proof combines our general theory with computer-assisted verification of certain Lie algebra generation properties that ensure the required hypoellipticity and irreducibility conditions.</description>

      <title>Models of Opinion Dynamics with Random Parametrisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a generalisation of the Galam model of binary opinion dynamics in which iterative discussions take place in local groups of individuals and study the effects of random deviations from the group majority. The probability of a deviation or flip depends on the magnitude of the majority. Depending on the values of the flip parameters which give the probability of a deviation, the model shows a wide variety of behaviour. We are interested in the characteristics of the model when the flip parameters are themselves randomly selected, following some probability distribution. Examples of these characteristics are whether large majorities and ties are attractors or repulsors, or the number of fixed points in the dynamics of the model. Which of the features of the model are likely to appear? Which ones are unlikely because they only present as events of low probability with respect to the distribution of the flip parameters? Answers to such questions allow us to distinguish mathematical properties which are stable under a variety of assumptions on the distribution of the flip parameters from features which are very rare and thus more of theoretical than practical interest. In this article, we present both exact numerical results for specific distributions of the flip parameters and small discussion groups and rigorous results in the form of limit theorems for large discussion groups. Small discussion groups model friend or work groups -- people that personally know each other and frequently spend time together. Large groups represent scenarios such as social media or political entities such as cities, states, or countries.</description>

      <title>Energy-consistent integration of mechanical systems based on Livens principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we make use of Livens principle (sometimes also referred to as Hamilton-Pontryagin principle) in order to obtain a novel structure-preserving integrator for mechanical systems. In contrast to the canonical Hamiltonian equations of motion, the Euler-Lagrange equations pertaining to Livens principle circumvent the need to invert the mass matrix. This is an essential advantage with respect to singular mass matrices, which can yield severe difficulties for the modelling and simulation of multibody systems. Moreover, Livens principle unifies both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian viewpoints on mechanics. Additionally, the present framework avoids the need to set up the system's Hamiltonian. The novel scheme algorithmically conserves a general energy function and aims at the preservation of momentum maps corresponding to symmetries of the system. We present an extension to mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints. The performance of the newly devised method is studied in representative examples.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension and attracting laminations for fully irreducible automorphisms of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a classic theorem of Birman and Series about the set of complete simple geodesics on a hyperbolic surface, we study the Hausdorff dimension of the set of endpoints in $\partial F_r$ of some abstract algebraic laminations associated with free group automorphisms.
  For an exponentially growing outer automorphism $\phi\in Out(F_r)$ we show that the set of endpoints $\mathcal E_{L}\subseteq \partial F_r$ of any of the \emph{attracting laminations} $L$ of $\phi$ has Hausdorff dimension $0$ for any tree $T\in cv_r$ and any visual metric on the boundary $\partial T=\partial F_r$. If $\phi\in Out(F_r)$ is an atoroidal and fully irreducible, we deduce the same conclusion for the set of endpoints of the ending lamination $\Lambda_\phi$ of $\phi$ that gets collapsed by the Cannon-Thurston map $\partial F_r\to \partial G_\phi$ for the associated free-by-cyclic group $G_\phi=F_r\rtimes_\phi\mathbb Z$.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory is presented for linear, local, short-wavelength instabilities in swirling flows, in which axial shear, differential rotation, radial thermal stratification, viscosity, and thermal diffusivity are all taken into account. A geometrical optics approach is applied to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation, leading to a set of amplitude transport equations. From these, a dispersion relation is derived, capturing two distinct types of instability: a stationary centrifugal instability and an oscillatory, visco-diffusive McIntyre instability. Instability regions corresponding to different axial or azimuthal wavenumbers are found to possess envelopes in the plane of physical parameters, which are explicitly determined using the discriminants of polynomials. As these envelopes are shown to bound the union of instability regions associated with particular wavenumbers, it is concluded that the envelopes correspond to curves of critical values of physical parameters, thereby providing compact, closed-form criteria for the onset of instability. The derived analytical criteria are validated for swirling flows modelled by a cylindrical, differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria unify and extend, to viscous and thermodiffusive differentially heated swirling flows, the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling, differentially heated, visco-diffusive flows, thereby generalising the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <title>Consecutive collision orbits in the restricted three-body problem above the first critical energy value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the planar circular restricted three-body problem for energy levels slightly above the first critical value. We first observe that the energy hypersurfaces in the Birkhoff regularization corresponding to these energy levels are of contact type. Then, using a version of Rabinowitz Floer homology, we establish the existence of either a periodic symmetric collision orbit or infinitely many symmetric consecutive collision orbits. Furthermore, by an analytic continuation argument, for generic mass ratios and energy levels, we prove that there is no periodic symmetric collision orbit with odd number of collisions. This in turn implies the existence of at least two symmetric consecutive collision orbits.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Water Treatment through Fractional-Order Chemostat Modeling with Sliding Memory and Periodic Boundary Conditions: A Mathematical Framework for Clean Water and Sanitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work develops and analyzes a novel fractional-order chemostat system (FOCS) with a Caputo fractional derivative (CFD) featuring a sliding memory window and periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), designed to model microbial pollutant degradation in sustainable water treatment. By incorporating the Caputo fractional derivative with sliding memory (CFDS), the model captures time-dependent behaviors and memory effects in biological systems more realistically than classical integer-order formulations. We reduce the two-dimensional fractional differential equations (FDEs) governing substrate and biomass concentrations to a one-dimensional FDE by utilizing the PBCs. The existence and uniqueness of non-trivial, periodic solutions are established using the Caratheodory framework and fixed-point theorems, ensuring the system's well-posedness. We prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions, demonstrating that substrate concentrations remain within physically meaningful bounds and biomass concentrations stay strictly positive, with solution trajectories confined to a biologically feasible invariant set. Additionally, we analyze non-trivial equilibria under constant dilution rates and derive their stability properties. The rigorous mathematical results confirm the viability of FOCS models for representing memory-driven, periodic bioprocesses, offering a foundation for advanced water treatment strategies that align with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).</description>

      <title>Surfaces with Klein bottle topology occur in fusion reactor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic confinement fusion devices, such as tokamaks and stellarators, are designed such that magnetic field lines lie in magnetic surfaces that form a foliation of nested genus-1 tori. The Poincar\'e-Hopf index theorem implies that only surfaces with genus 1 allow for vector fields that lie tangent to the surface and are smooth and nowhere-vanishing. It is often implicitly assumed that magnetic surfaces are always toroidal. This paper we show that surfaces with the topology of an immersed Klein bottle (the only other genus-1 compact surface) can also occur in fusion reactor fields.
  These surfaces occur around fixed points of the Poincar\'e map that are reflection-hyperbolic, and are spanned by the field lines that asymptotically approach and depart from this closed line. Configurations in which this occurs appear in the stellarator database QUASR, and have been described in literature in the context of abnormal satwooth crashes.</description>
