      <title>Information-Theoretic Constraints on Variational Quantum Optimization: Efficiency Transitions and the Dynamical Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are the leading candidates for near-term quantum advantage, yet their scalability is limited by the ``Barren Plateau'' phenomenon. While traditionally attributed to geometric vanishing gradients, we propose an information-theoretic perspective. Using ancilla-mediated coherent feedback, we demonstrate an empirical constitutive relation $\Delta E \leq \eta I(S:A)$ linking work extraction to mutual information, with quantum entanglement providing a factor-of-2 advantage over classical Landauer bounds. By scaling the system size, we identify a distinct efficiency transition governed by the dimension of the Dynamical Lie Algebra. Systems with polynomial algebraic complexity exhibit sustained positive efficiency, whereas systems with exponential complexity undergo an ``efficiency collapse'' ($\eta \to 0$) at $N \approx 6$ qubits. These results suggest that the trainability boundary in variational algorithms correlates with information-theoretic limits of quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Analysis of Low-Round Keccak/SHA-3 Preimage Attack: From Classical 2^57.8 to Quantum 2^28.9 using Qiskit Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-conscious analysis of the quantum acceleration of the classical 3-round Keccak-256 preimage attack using Grover's Algorithm. While the theoretical quantum speed-up from T_cl=2^{57.8} (classical) to T_qu = 2^{28.9} (quantum) is mathematically sound, the practical implementation overhead is so extreme that attacks remain wholly infeasible in both resource and runtime dimensions. Using Qiskit-based circuit synthesis, we derive that a 3-round Keccak quantum oracle requires: 9,600 Toffoli gates (with uncomputation for reversibility); 3,200 logical qubits (1,600 state + 1,600 auxiliary); 7.47 * 10^{13} total 2-qubit gates (full Grover search); 3.2 million physical qubits (with quantum error correction)PROHIBITIVE; 0.12 years (43 days) to 2,365+ years execution time, depending on machine assumptions. These barriers -- particularly the physical qubit requirements, circuit depth, and error accumulation -- render the quantum attack infeasible for any foreseeable quantum computer. Consequently, SHA-3 security is not threatened by quantum computers for preimage attacks. We emphasize the critical importance of hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis: the elegant asymptotic theory of Grover's Algorithm hides an engineering overhead so prohibitive that the quantum approach becomes infeasible from both resource and implementation perspectives.</description>

      <title>Dawn and Twilight Time in Quantum Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable decay exhibits a familiar exponential regime bracketed by early-time deviations and late-time power-law tails. We adopt the real-time, flux-based definition of the decay rate in the spirit of Andreassen et al.\ direct method and present a complete analysis of one-dimensional quantum-mechanical resonance models. We show that the kernel admits a universal pole--plus--branch decomposition and use it to define two computable time scales: a dawn time, when a single resonant contribution starts dominating and exponential decay sets in, and a twilight time, when the branch-cut tail overtakes exponential decay. The latter can be expressed in closed form via the Lambert $W$ function, making its parametric dependence manifest without fitting. For square, modified square, and P\"oschl--Teller barriers we obtain simple thick-barrier formulas, clarify the relation $\Gamma T = T_{\text{trans}}$ between the decay rate $\Gamma$, oscillation period $T$, and transmission probability $T_{\text{trans}}$, and indicate how our spectral picture can be naturally extended to quantum field theoretic vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Stabilizers may be poor bounds for fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The defining feature of ideal Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states is that they are unchanged by stabilizers, which allow them to detect and correct for common errors without destroying the quantum information encoded in the states. Given this property, can one use the amount to which a state is unchanged by the stabilizers as a proxy for the quality of a GKP state? This is shown to hold in the opposite manner to which it is routinely assumed, because in fact the fidelity a state has to an ideal GKP state is only upper bounded by the stabilizer expectation values. This means that, for qubits encoded in harmonic oscillators via the GKP code, a good stabilizer expectation value does not guarantee proximity to an ideal GKP state in terms of any distance based on fidelity.</description>

      <title>The entangling power of non-entangling channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are processes that cannot generate entanglement but may, nevertheless, amplify entanglement already present in a system. Here, we show that a non-entangling operation can increase the Schmidt number of a quantum state only if it can generate entanglement with some non-zero probability. This is in stark contrast to the case where the parties of a quantum network are only able to control their joint state by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). There, being able to apply operations probabilistically (stochastic LOCC) does not increase the Schmidt number. Our findings show that certain non-entangling operations become entangling when selecting on specific measurement outcomes. This naturally leads us to the class of stochastically non-entangling maps, being those that cannot generate entanglement even probabilistically. Intrigued by this finding, we devise a Schmidt number for quantum channels that quantifies whether a channel can generate entanglement probabilistically. Moreover, we show that a channel is non-entangling if and only if its dual map is witness-preserving -- it takes entanglement witnesses to witnesses. Based on this finding, we derive Bell-like inequalities whose violation signals that a process generates entanglement.</description>

      <title>Growth and spreading of quantum resources under random circuit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body dynamics generate nonclassical correlations naturally described by quantum resource theories. Quantum magic resources (or nonstabilizerness) capture deviation from classically simulable stabilizer states, while coherence and fermionic non-Gaussianity measure departure from the computational basis and from fermionic Gaussian states, respectively. We track these resources in a subsystem of a one-dimensional qubit chain evolved by random brickwall circuits. For resource-generating gates, evolution from low-resource states exhibits a universal rise-peak-fall behavior, with the peak time scaling logarithmically with subsystem size and the resource eventually decaying as the subsystem approaches a maximally mixed state. Circuits whose gates do not create the resource but entangle neighboring qubits, give rise to a ballistic spreading of quantum resource initially confined to a region of the initial state. Our results give a unified picture of spatiotemporal resource dynamics in local circuits and a baseline for more structured quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak symmetry breaking in monitored dipole conserving quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the information-theoretic phases of monitored quantum circuits subject to dynamics that conserves both charge and dipole moment, as well as measurements of the local charge density. Explicitly, both charge and dipole-moment conservation are strong symmetries, but under the dynamics they can be spontaneously broken to weak symmetries: this spontaneous symmetry breaking has an information-theoretic interpretation in terms of whether one can learn global charges from local measurements. We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard. In two dimensions, the low-measurement phase is an exotic critical phase with anisotropic spacetime scaling, analogous to a smectic liquid crystal.</description>

      <title>Extreme non-negative Wigner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing an operational characterization of the Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e., the set of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function, is a longstanding open problem. For pure states, the only WPS are Gaussian states, but the situation is considerably more subtle for mixed states. Here, we approach the problem using convex geometry, reducing the question to the characterization of the extreme points of the set of WPS. We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states. Our results build upon new mathematical properties of the set of WPS derived in a companion paper and unveil the remarkable structure of mixed states with non-negative Wigner functions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement without Quantum Mechanics: Operational Constraints on the Quantum Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is often regarded as an inherently quantum feature. We show that this does not have to be the case: under restricted operational access, classical correlations can appear nonseparable when expressed in the formalism of quantum mechanics. If an observer is limited to a constrained set of measurements and transformations, certain classical phase-space distributions can mimic entanglement-like behaviours. Imposing positivity of the associated Hilbert space operator as a physicality requirement removes some of these representational artifacts, revealing a regime in which nonseparability is genuine but still reproducible by classical models. Only when the operational restrictions on the observer are lifted further--allowing operational tests of measurement incompatibility or other nonclassical signatures--does one obtain entanglement that can no longer be captured by any classical description. This operational hierarchy distinguishes classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement.</description>

      <title>Noise-Induced Thermalization in Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, noise is widely regarded as the primary obstacle to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, certain stages of the quantum computing pipeline can, in fact, benefit from this noise. In this work, we exploit the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to show that noise generically accelerates a fundamental task in quantum computing -- the preparation of Gibbs states. We demonstrate this behavior using classical and quantum simulations with Haar-random and phase-flip noise, respectively, on a spin-1/2 chain with a local Hamiltonian. Our non-integrable model sees ~3.5x faster thermalization in the presence of noise, while our integrable model, which would not otherwise thermalize, reaches a thermal state due to noise. Since certifying a local Gibbs state is relatively easy on a quantum computer, our approach provides a new practical solution to a key problem in quantum computing. More broadly, these results establish a new paradigm in which noise can be harnessed on quantum computers, enabling practical advantages before the years of fault-tolerance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher-information limits of resonant nanophotonic sensors: why high-Q is not optimal even at the quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum metrological framework for resonant nanophotonic sensors based on subwavelength Fabry--Perot slit cavities. Building on classical Fisher-information analyses of resonant transmission sensors, we model parameter encoding as a phase-and-loss quantum channel embedded in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We derive the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for coherent and Gaussian probe states under linear loss and show that, even at the quantum limit, optimal estimation precision is governed by the generator of parameter-dependent phase shifts rather than by the cavity quality factor. Consequently, the operating point that maximizes the QFI does not generally coincide with the maximum-Q resonance. Quantum resources enhance sensitivity but do not redefine the optimal geometry. Our results provide physically transparent design principles for quantum-enhanced nanophotonic sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Radiometric Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical quantum computing, as well as quantum communication and sensing technology based on quantum correlations are in preparation. These require photodiodes for the detection of about 10^16 photons per second with close to perfect quantum efficiency. Already the radiometric calibration is a challenge. Here, we provide the theoretical description of the quantum radiometric calibration method. Its foundation is squeezed light and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, making it an example of quantum metrology based on quantum correlations. Unlike all existing radiometric calibration methods, ours is in situ and provides both the detection efficiency and the more stringent quantum efficiency directly for the measurement frequencies of the user application. We calibrate a pair of the most efficient commercially available photodiode at 1550 nm to a system detection efficiency of (97.20 + 0.37)% using 10-dB-squeezed vacuum states. Our method has great potential for significantly higher precision and accuracy, but even with this measurement, we can clearly say that the available photodiode efficiencies for 1550 nm are unexpectedly low, too low for future gravitational wave detectors and for optical quantum computing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically derive the quantum state of a single-photon pulse scattered from a single quantum two-level emitter interacting with a vibrational bath. This solution for the quadripartite system enables an information-theoretic characterization of vibrational effects in quantum light spectroscopy. We show that vibration-induced dephasing reduces the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for estimating the emitter's linewidth, largely reflecting the Franck-Condon suppression of light-matter coupling. Comparing time- and frequency-resolved photodetection, we find the latter to be more informative in estimating the emitter's linewidth for stronger vibrational coupling.</description>

      <title>Roadmap: 2D Materials for Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a versatile and powerful platform for quantum technologies, offering atomic-scale control, strong quantum confinement, and seamless integration into heterogeneous device architectures. Their reduced dimensionality enables unique quantum phenomena, including optically addressable spin defects, tunable single-photon emitters, low-dimensional magnetism, gate-controlled superconductivity, and correlated states in Moir\'e superlattices. This Roadmap provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future directions in exploiting 2D materials for quantum sensing, computation, communication, and simulation. We survey advances spanning spin defects and quantum sensing, quantum emitters and nonlinear photonics, computational theory and data-driven discovery of quantum defects, spintronic and magnonic devices, cavity-engineered quantum materials, superconducting and hybrid quantum circuits, quantum dots, Moir\'e quantum simulators, and quantum communication platforms. Across these themes, we identify common challenges in defect control, coherence preservation, interfacial engineering, and scalable integration, alongside emerging opportunities driven by machine$-$learning$-$assisted design and integrated experiment$-$theory feedback loops. By connecting microscopic quantum states to mesoscopic excitations and macroscopic device architectures, this Roadmap outlines a materials-centric framework for integrating coherent quantum functionalities and positions 2D materials as foundational building blocks for next-generation quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>High efficiency controlled quantum secure direct communication with 4D qudits and Grover search algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the progress of quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is impeded by a fundamental trade off among control efficiency, security, and scalability. This study proposes an innovative controlled QSDC protocol based on a collaborative unitary sequence decoding paradigm to break this deadlock.Leveraging four dimensional single particle states, the protocol's core innovation lies in its three party decoding mechanism. The controller's authorization unlocks a specific unitary operation sequence, enabling the receiver to directly decode exclusively via quantum operations, eliminating the need for classical computational algorithms in conventional protocols. This tailored sequence underpins its high efficiency.The protocol also seamlessly incorporates decoy photon authentication, creating a multi layer defense against both external and internal attacks. Consequently, it achieves a remarkable qudit efficiency of 66.7%, offering a significant performance improvement over existing schemes and an efficient, highly secure solution for future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Trade-off relations and enhancement protocol of quantum battery capacities in multipartite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, we investigate the trade-off relations of quantum battery capacities in two-qubit system. We find that the sum of subsystem battery capacity is governed by the total system capacity, with this trade-off relation persisting for a class of Hamiltonians, including Ising, XX, XXZ and XXX models. Then building on this relation, we define residual battery capacity for general quantum states and establish coherent/incoherent components of subsystem battery capacity. Furthermore, we introduce the protocol to guide the selection of appropriate incoherent unitary operations for enhancing subsystem battery capacity in specific scenarios, along with a sufficient condition for achieving subsystem capacity gain through unitary operation. Numerical examples validate the feasibility of the incoherent operation protocol. Additionally, for the three-qubit system, we also established a set of theories and results parallel to those for two-qubit case. Finally, we determine the minimum time required to enhance subsystem battery capacity via a single incoherent operation in our protocol. Our findings contribute to the development of quantum battery theory and quantum energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Enabling Technologies for Scalable Superconducting Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments with superconducting quantum processors have successfully demonstrated the basic functions needed for quantum computation and evidence of utility, albeit without a sizable array of error-corrected qubits. The realization of the full potential of quantum computing centers on achieving large scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. Science, engineering and industry advances are needed to robustly generate, sustain, and efficiently manipulate an exponentially large computational (Hilbert) space as well as supply the number and quality components needed for such a scaled system. In this article, we suggest critical areas of quantum system and ecosystem development, with respect to the handling and transmission of quantum information within and out of a cryogenic environment, that would accelerate the development of quantum computers based on superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Characterizing entanglement shareability and distribution in $N$-partite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the shareability and distribution of entanglement possesses fundamental significance in quantum information tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that the square of bipartite entanglement measures $G_q$-concurrence, which is the generalization of concurrence, follows a set of hierarchical monogamy relations for any $N$-qubit quantum state. On the basis of these monogamy inequalities, we render two kinds of hierarchical indicators that exhibit evident advantages in the capacity of witnessing entanglement. Moreover, we show an analytical relation between $G_q$-concurrence and concurrence in $2\otimes d$ systems. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the monogamy property of squared $G_q$-concurrence is superior to that of squared concurrence in $2\otimes d_2\otimes d_3\otimes\cdots\otimes d_N$ systems. In addition, several concrete examples are provided to illustrate that for multilevel systems, the squared $G_q$-concurrence satisfies the monogamy relation, even if the squared concurrence does not. These results better reveal the intriguing characteristic of multilevel entanglement and provide critical insights into the entanglement distribution within multipartite quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical search for integrable multistate Landau-Zener models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for exactly solvable models is an evergreen topic in theoretical physics. In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above. Our work can serve as a guideline to identify new exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models in the future.</description>

      <title>Microscopic model for a spatial multimode generation based on Multi-pump Four Wave Mixing in hot vapours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an important resource for quantum information processing. It has been shown that it is possible to employ alkali atoms to implement single device multipartite entanglement by using nonlinear processes with spatial modes. This work presents the first microscopic description of such multi-mode generation with two-pump four wave mixing (4WM) in dense atomic media. We implement an extension of a double $\Lambda$ model for a single pump 4WM in order to describe the multi-mode generation with a two-pump configuration. We propose a Floquet expansion to solve the multimode gain amplification and noise properties. The model describes the angle and the two-photon dependency of the multimode generation and the quantum correlations among the modes. We investigate the entanglement properties of the system, describing the main properties of previous experimental observations. Such a microscopic description can be used to predict the gain distribution of modes and the quantum correlation within a typical range of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Bosonic quantum computing with near-term devices and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged.) This thesis investigates scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation through the development of bosonic quantum codes, quantum LDPC codes, and decoding protocols that connect continuous-variable and discrete-variable error correction. We investigate superconducting microwave implementations of continuous-variable quantum computing, including the deterministic generation of cubic phase states, and introduce the dissipatively stabilized squeezed cat qubit, a noise-biased bosonic encoding with enhanced error suppression and faster gates. The performance of rotation-symmetric and GKP codes is analyzed under realistic noise and measurement models, revealing key trade-offs in measurement-based schemes. To integrate bosonic codes into larger architectures, we develop decoding methods that exploit analog syndrome information, enabling quasi-single-shot decoding in concatenated systems. On the discrete-variable side, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a highly parallelizable decoder for quantum LDPC codes, and propose quantum radial codes, a new family of single-shot LDPC codes with low overhead and strong circuit-level performance. Finally, we present fault complexes, a homological framework for analyzing faults in dynamic quantum error correction protocols. Extending the role of homology in static CSS codes, fault complexes provide a general language for the design and analysis of fault-tolerant schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With intensive studies of quantum thermodynamics, the quantum batteries (QBs) have been proposed to store and transfer energy via quantum effects. Despite many theoretical models, decoherence remains a severe challenge and practical platforms are still rare. Here we propose the QB based on the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO), using the signal field as the energy-storage unit. We carefully separate the ergotropy into coherent and incoherent components and find that the coherent part decays roughly half as slowly as the incoherent part. More importantly, the coherent ergotropy and the average charging power reach their respective maxima at essentially the same moment, i.e., $\gamma_s t \approx 10$. This coincidence defines the optimal instant to switch off the pump. Finally, coupling the QB to a two-level system (TLS) as the load, we demonstrate an efficient discharge process of the QB. Our work establishes a realistic and immediately-implementable QB architecture on a mature optical platform.</description>

      <title>Coherent transfer via parametric control of normal-mode splitting in a superconducting multimode resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave storage and retrieval are essential capabilities for superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip multimode resonator in which strong parametric modulation induces a large and tunable normal-mode splitting that enables microwave storage. When the spectral bandwidth of a short microwave pulse covers the two dressed-state absorption peaks, part of the pulse is absorbed and undergoes coherent energy exchange between the modes, producing a clear time-domain beating signal. By switching off the modulation before the beating arrives, we realize on-demand storage and retrieval, demonstrating an alternative approach to microwave photonic quantum memory. This parametric-normal-mode-splitting protocol offers a practical route toward a controllable quantum-memory mechanism in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discrimination of two-party quantum states and provide a quantum data-hiding scheme using two-qubit separable states. We first provide a bound on the optimal local discrimination of two-party quantum states, and establish a sufficient condition under which a two-party quantum state ensemble can be used to construct a data-hiding scheme. We illustrate this condition with examples of two-qubit state ensembles consisting of two orthogonal separable states. As our data-hiding scheme can be implemented with separable states of the lowest possible dimension, its practical realization becomes significantly more attainable.</description>

      <title>Exponential convergence dynamics in Grover's search algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's search algorithm is the cornerstone of many applications of quantum computing, providing a quadratic speed-up over classical methods. One limitation of the algorithm is that it requires knowledge of the number of solutions to obtain an optimal success probability, due to the oscillatory dynamics between the initial and solutions states (the ``souffl\'e problem''). While various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each has their drawbacks in terms of inefficiency or sensitivity to control errors. Here, we modify Grover's algorithm to eliminate the oscillatory dynamics, such that the search proceeds as an exponential decay into the solution states. The basic idea is to convert the solution states into a reservoir by using ancilla qubits such that the initial state is nonreflectively absorbed. Trotterizing the continuous algorithm yields a quantum circuit that gives equivalent performance, which has the same quadratic quantum speedup as the original algorithm.</description>

      <title>Universal Blind Quantum Computation with Recursive Rotation Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind Quantum Computation lets a limited-capability client delegate its complex computation to a remote server without revealing its data or computation. Several such protocols have been proposed under varied quantum computing models. However, these protocols either rely on highly entangled resource states (in measurement-based models) or are based on non-parametric resource sets (in circuit-based models). These restrictions hinder the practical applicability of such an algorithm in the NISQ era, especially concerning the hybrid quantum-classical infrastructure, which depends on parametric gates. We present a protocol for universal blind quantum computation based on recursive decryption of parametric rotation gates, which does not require a highly entangled state at the server side and substantially reduces the communication rounds required for practical prototyping of secure variational algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport and localization in isolated quantum systems are typically attributed to spatially-extended disorder, leaving the influence of a few controllable defects largely unexplored despite their relevance to engineered quantum platforms. We introduce an analytic framework showing how a single defect profoundly reshapes wave-function spreading on a finite isolated and periodic tight-binding lattice. Adapting the defect technique from classical random-walk studies, we obtain exact time-resolved site-occupation probabilities and several observables of interest. Even one defect induces striking nonlinear and nonlocal effects, including non-monotonic suppression of transport, enhanced localization at distant sites, and strong sensitivity to the initial particle position at long times. These results demonstrate that minimal perturbations can generate unexpected long-time transport signatures, establishing a microscopic defect-driven mechanism of quantum localization.</description>

      <title>Composite N-Q-S: Serial/Parallel Instrument Axioms, Bipartite Order-Effect Bounds, and a Monitored Lindblad Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a composite operational architecture for sequential quantum measurements that (i) gives a tight bipartite order-effect bound with an explicit equality set characterized on the Halmos two-subspace block, (ii) upgrades Doeblin-type minorization to composite instruments and proves a product lower bound for the operational Doeblin constants, yielding data-driven exponential mixing rates, (iii) derives a diamond-norm commutator bound that quantifies how serial and parallel rearrangements influence observable deviations, and (iv) establishes a monitored Lindblad limit that links discrete look-return loops to continuous-time GKLS dynamics under transparent assumptions. Building on the GKLS framework of Gorini, Kossakowski, Sudarshan, Lindblad, Davies, Spohn, and later work of Fagnola-Rebolledo and Lami et al., we go beyond asymptotic statements by providing finite-sample certificates for the minorization parameter via exact binomial intervals and propagating them to rigorous bounds on the number of interaction steps required to attain a prescribed accuracy. A minimal qubit toy model and CSV-based scripts are supplied for full reproducibility. Our results position order-effect control and operational mixing on a single quantitative axis, from equality windows for pairs of projections to certified network mixing under monitoring. The framework targets readers in quantum information and quantum foundations who need explicit constants that are estimable from data and transferable to device-level guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum indistinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states is a valuable resource in quantum information applications such as cryptography and randomness generation. In this article, we present a sequential state-discrimination scheme that enables multiple parties to share quantum uncertainty, in terms of the max relative entropy, generated by a single party. Our scheme is based upon maximum-confidence measurements and takes advantages of weak measurements to allow a number of parties to perform state discrimination on a single quantum system. We review known sequential state discrimination and show how our scheme would work through a number of examples where ensembles may or may not contain symmetries. Our results will have a role to play in understanding the ultimate limits of sequential information extraction and guide the development of quantum resource sharing in sequential settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect in Local Gauge Symmetry Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding relaxation in isolated quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge. Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Decoherence in the Pure Dephasing Spin-Boson Model with Hermitian or Non-Hermitian Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the decoherence of qubit due to its coupling to a Hermitian or a non-Hermitian bath within the pure dephasing spin-boson model. First, using this model, we analytically establish the previously anticipated similarity between the non-equilibrium and the equilibrium correlation functions $P_x(t)$ and $C_x(t)$. Then, in the short/long time asymptotic behaviors of $P_x(t)$, we find singular dependence on $A$ (coupling strength) and $s$ (bath exponent) at their integer values. Finally, we find that the non-Hermitian bath tends to suppress the decoherence of qubit for all values of $A$ and $s$, in contrast to the conclusion of Dey et al. . Our results show the potential of non-Hermitian environment engineering in suppressing the decoherence of qubit.</description>

      <title>Continuous-mode analysis for practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enables two remote parties to establish information-theoretically secure keys and offers high practical feasibility due to its compatibility with mature coherent optical communication technologies. However, as CV-QKD systems progress toward digital implementations, device nonidealities drive the optical field from a single-mode to a continuous-mode region, thereby underscoring the mismatch between theoretical models and practical systems. Here, we introduce temporal modes to construct an entanglement-based scheme that more accurately captures device nonidealities and develop a corresponding secret key rate calculation method applicable to continuous-mode scenarios. We demonstrate that optimizing the pulse-shaping format can significantly improve performance under detector-bandwidth-limited conditions. Experimental results also confirm that the proposed model effectively describes the impact of sampling-time deviations. We further analyze a linear weighted-reconstruction digital signal processing method,which improves the secret key rate by approximately 50% in a 30-km fiber experiment without requiring additional hardware, demonstrating a substantial performance enhancement at metropolitan distances. The proposed theoretical framework accommodates a broader range of experimental conditions and can guide the optimization of digital CV-QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Practical Challenges in Executing Shor's Algorithm on Existing Quantum Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.</description>

      <title>Wave-packet dynamics in pseudo-Hermitian lattices: Coexistence of Hermitian and non-Hermitian wavefronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems and reveals a surprising phenomenon: The simultaneous propagation of two distinct wavefronts, one traveling at the non-Hermitian velocity and the other at the Hermitian velocity. We show that this dual-front behavior arises naturally in systems governed by a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Using the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model as our primary example, we demonstrate that this coexistence is essential for understanding a wide array of unconventional dynamical effects, including abrupt ``non-Hermitian reflections'', sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets seeded by the small initial tails. We present analytic predictions that closely match numerical simulations. These results may offer new insight into the topology of non-Hermitian systems and point toward measurable experimental consequences.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Bluestein's Algorithm for Arbitrary-Size Quantum Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum analogue of Bluestein's algorithm (QBA) that implements an exact $N$-point Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for arbitrary $N$. Our construction factors the $N$-dimensional QFT unitary into three diagonal quadratic-phase gates and two standard radix-2 QFT subcircuits of size $M = 2^m$ (with $M \ge 2N - 1$). This achieves asymptotic gate complexity $O((\log N)^2)$ and uses $O(\log N)$ qubits, matching the performance of a power-of-two QFT on $m$ qubits while avoiding the need to embed into a larger Hilbert space. We validate the correctness of the algorithm through a concrete implementation in Qiskit and classical simulation, confirming that QBA produces the exact $N$-point discrete Fourier transform on arbitrary-length inputs.</description>

      <title>Amplitude-amplified coherence detection and estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of quantum coherence is of fundamental importance both in the foundations of quantum theory as well as for the rapidly developing field of quantum technologies, where coherence has been linked to quantum advantage. Typical approaches for detecting coherence employ {\it coherence witnesses} -- observable quantities whose expectation value can be used to certify the presence of coherence. By design, coherence witnesses are only able to detect coherence for some, but not all, possible states of a quantum system. In this work we construct protocols capable of detecting the presence of coherence in an {\it unknown} pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle$. Having access to $m$ copies of an unknown pure state $|\psi\rangle$ we show that the sample complexity of any experimental procedure for detecting coherence with constant probability of success $\ge 2/3$ is $\Theta(c(|\psi\rangle)^{-1})$, where $c(|\psi\rangle)$ is the geometric measure of coherence of $|\psi\rangle$. However, assuming access to the unitary $U_\psi$ which prepares the unknown state $|\psi\rangle$, and its inverse $U_\psi^\dagger$, we devise a coherence detecting protocol that employs amplitude-amplification {\it a la} Grover, and uses a quadratically smaller number $O(c(|\psi\rangle)^{-1/2})$ of samples. Furthermore, by augmenting amplitude amplification with phase estimation we obtain an experimental estimation of upper bounds on the geometric measure of coherence within additive error $\varepsilon$ with a sample complexity that scales as $O(1/\varepsilon)$ as compared to the $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity of Monte Carlo estimation methods. The average number of samples needed in our amplitude estimation protocol provides a new operational interpretation for the geometric measure of coherence. Finally, we also derive bounds on the amount of noise our protocols are able to tolerate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic security by leveraging quantum mechanics, yet the cost and complexity of dedicated hardware and fiber infrastructure have so far limited large-scale deployment and experimentation. In this paper, we introduce Quditto, an automated open-access emulation platform that combines high-fidelity quantum-channel modeling with a standardized key-delivery API, enabling users to interact with the emulated network exactly as they would with real QKD hardware. Quditto modular design supports pluggable protocol implementations, complex key management schemes and detailed channel models, including variable attenuation and decoherence. We validate Quditto by deploying networks of various sizes and demonstrate its flexibility through two proof-of-concept scenarios featuring eavesdropper attacks and heterogeneous channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian and double-bracket flow formulations of quantum measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework that unifies quantum measurement dynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics, and double-bracket gradient flows. We do so by providing explicit expressions for stochastic Hamiltonians that produce state dynamics identical to those that happen during continuous quantum measurements. When such dynamical processes are integrated over sufficiently long time intervals, they yield the same results and statistics as during wavefunction collapse. That is, wavefunction collapse can be interpreted as coarse-grained (stochastic) Hamiltonian dynamics. Alternatively, wavefunction collapse can be interpreted as double-bracket gradient flows determined by derivatives of (stochastic) potentials defined in terms of observables with direct physical interpretations. The gradient flows minimize the variance of the monitored observable. Our derivations hold for general monitoring described by non-Hermitian jump processes. We show that such reinterpretations of measurement dynamics facilitate the design of feedback processes. In particular, we introduce feedback processes that yield deterministic double-bracket flow equations, which prepare ground states of a target Hamiltonian, and feedback processes for state preparation. We conclude by re-interpreting feedback processes as gradient flows with tilted fixed points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informationally complete measurements form the foundation of universal quantum state reconstruction, while quantum parameter estimation is based on the local structure of the manifold of quantum states. Here we establish a general link between these two aspects, in the context of a single informationally complete measurement, by employing a suitably adapted operator frame theory. In particular, we bound the ratio between the classical and quantum Fisher information in terms of the spectral decomposition of the associated frame operator, and connect these bounds to the optimal and least optimal directions for parameter encoding. The geometric and operational characterization of information extraction thus obtained reveals the fundamental tradeoff imposed by informational completeness on local quantum parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to calculate the frequency components of a pump waveform driving a parametric oscillator, which realizes a desired frequency mixing or scattering between modes. The method is validated by numerical analysis and we study its sensitivity to added Gaussian noise. A series of experiments apply the method and demonstrate its ability to realize complex scattering processes involving many modes at microwave frequencies, including non-reciprocal mode circulation. We also present an approximate method to dynamically control mode scattering, capable of rapidly routing signals between modes in a prescribed manner. These methods are useful tools for encoding and manipulating continuous variable quantum information with multi-modal Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Atomic Ionization Driven by Strong Quantum Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently available high-intensity quantum light pulses provide novel tools for controlling light-matter interactions. However, the rigor of the theoretical frameworks currently used to describe the interaction of strong quantum light with atoms and molecules remains unverified. Here, we establish a rigorous benchmark by solving the fully quantized time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for an atom exposed to bright squeezed vacuum light. Our \textit{ab initio} simulations reveal a critical limitation of the widely used $Q$-representation: although it accurately reproduces the total photoelectron spectrum after tracing over photon states, it completely fails to capture the electron-photon joint energy spectrum. To overcome this limitation, we develop a general theoretical framework based on the Feynman path integral that properly incorporates the electron-photon quantum entanglement. Our results provide both quantitative benchmarks and fundamental theoretical insights for the emerging field of strong-field quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Energy Inference of Black-Box Quantum Computers Using Quantum Speed Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-based quantum computers do not provide users with access to hardware-level information such as the underlying Hamiltonians, which obstructs the characterization of their physical properties. We propose a method to infer the energy scales of gate Hamiltonians in such black-box quantum processors using only user-accessible data, by exploiting quantum speed limits. Specifically, we reinterpret the Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm bounds as estimators of the energy expectation value and variance, respectively, and relate them to the shortest time for the processor to orthogonalize a quantum state. This shortest gate time, expected to lie on the nanosecond scale, is inferred from job execution times measured in seconds by employing gate-time amplification. We apply the method to IBM's superconducting quantum processor and estimate the energy scales associated with single-, two-, and three-qubit gates. The order of estimated energy is consistent with typical drive energies in superconducting qubit systems, suggesting that current gate operations approach the quantum speed limit. Our results demonstrate that fundamental energetic properties of black-box quantum computers can be quantitatively accessed through operational time measurements, reflecting the conjugate relationship between time and energy imposed by the uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>QuantGraph: A Receding-Horizon Quantum Graph Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic programming is a cornerstone of graph-based optimization. While effective, it scales unfavorably with problem size. In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden. In practice, the resulting closed-loop system exhibits robust behavior and lower overall complexity. Notably, for a fixed query budget, QuantGraph attains a 2x increase in control-discretization precision while still benefiting from Grover-search's inherent quadratic speedup compared to classical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the maximum rate achievable in the private communication over a bosonic quantum channel with a fully Gaussian protocol based on optimal single-mode Gaussian measurements. This rate establishes a lower bound on the secret rate capacity of the channel. We focus on the class of phase-insensitive Gaussian channels. For the thermal-loss and thermal amplification channels, our results demonstrate the optimality, within the constraints of our analysis, of previously proposed protocols, while also providing a significantly simplified formula for their performance evaluation. For the added noise channel, our rate provides a better lower bound than any previously known.</description>

      <title>Decoherence dynamics across sub-Planckian to arbitrary scales using kitten states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental decoherence occurs when a quantum system interacts with its surroundings, progressively reducing quantum interference and coherence, complicating the preservation of critical quantum properties over time, especially during experimental implementation. The effect of decoherence varies depending on the phase-space features of quantum states, which are theoretically characterized by the Wigner phase space and appear at different scales. We explore the compass state and its photon-added and photon-subtracted variants, each of which exhibits phase-space features with dimensions beyond the Planck scale, making them suitable for quantum sensing applications. We investigate the interaction of these states with a heat reservoir by employing a range of well-established theoretical techniques, revealing a clear tradeoff between the degree of fineness in the smallest features, such as the sub-Planck structure, and the extent of decoherence. Specifically, increasing the parameters enhances sub-Planck precision in phase space, concomitantly amplifying the fragility of these compass states to undesired decoherence. Our general illustration, validated through these compass states, also applies to any pure quantum state interacting with the considered heat reservoir, exhibiting enhanced sustainability of features at larger phase-space extensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a quadratic enhancement of power in a battery consisting of $N$ two-level systems or spins interacting with two photonic cavity modes, where one of the modes is in the dispersive regime. In contrast to Dicke batteries, the power enhancement arises from a $N^2$ scaling of both quantum correlations and speed of evolution, thus highlighting genuine quantum advantage. Moreover, this hybrid setup is experimentally realizable and ensures that power enhancement is not achieved at significant cost to energy efficiency, while allowing for greater tunability and stable operation in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform on a molecular qudit with full refocusing and state tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular spin qudits based on lanthanide complexes offer a promising platform for quantum technologies, combining chemical tunability with multi-level encoding. However, experimental demonstrations of their envisaged capabilities remain scarce, posing the difficulty of achieving precise control over coherences between qudit states in long pulse sequences. Here, we implement in 173Yb(trensal) qudit the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a core component of numerous quantum algorithms, storing quantum information in the phases of coherences. QFT provides an ideal benchmark for coherence manipulation and an unprecedented challenge for molecular spin qudits. We address this challenge by embedding a full-refocusing protocol for spin qudits in our algorithm, mitigating inhomogeneous broadening and enabling a high-fidelity recovery of the state. Complete state tomography demostrates the performance of the algorithm, while simulations provide insight into the physical mechanisms behind inhomogeneous broadening. This work shows the feasibility of quantum logic on molecular spin qudits and highlights their potential.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Generalized Coherent States through Intensity-Field Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of light are essential resources for quantum information processing and precision metrology. Among them, generalized coherent states (GCS), which naturally arise from the evolution of a coherent state with a nonlinear medium, exhibit useful quantum features such as Wigner negativity and metrological advantages [Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013165 (2023)]. Because these states remain coherent to all orders, their nonclassical character cannot be revealed through standard intensity-intensity correlation measurements. Here, we demonstrate that the intensity-field correlation function alone provides a simple and experimentally accessible witness of nonclassicality. For GCSs, any deviation of this normalized correlation from unity signals nonclassical behavior. We derive analytical results for Kerr-generated states and extend the analysis to statistical mixtures of GCSs. The proposed approach enables real-time, low-complexity detection of quantum signatures in non-Gaussian states, offering a practical tool for experiments across a broad range of nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>All Entangled States are Nonlocal and Self-Testable in the Broadcast Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement and Bell nonlocality are known to be inequivalent: there exist entangled states that admit a local hidden-variable model for all local measurements. Here we show that this gap disappears in a minimal broadcast extension of the Bell scenario. Assuming only the validity of quantum theory, we prove that for every entangled state $\rho_{AB}$ there exist local broadcasting maps and local measurements such that the resulting four--partite correlations cannot be reproduced by any broadcast network whose source is separable across the $A|B$ cut. Thus, all entangled states are broadcast nonlocal in quantum theory. In addition, we show that all (also mixed) multipartite states can be broadcast-self-tested, according to a natural operational definition.</description>

      <title>Prospects for quantum advantage in machine learning from the representability of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage in machine learning tasks requires navigating a complex landscape of proposed models and algorithms. To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial structures in quantum correlation: A new perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-theoretic structures play a central role in the description and analysis of quantum systems. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_\alpha$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different from the standard graph states arising from stabiliser formalism. Our approach is also different from the approach used by Braunstein et al. This class of states depend on a tunable mixing parameter $\alpha \in (0,1]$. We first establish the conditions under which the associated operator $\rho_\alpha^{A_G}$ is positive semidefinite and hence represents a valid quantum state. We then derive a positive partial transposition (PPT) condition for $A_{\alpha}$-graph states in terms of graph parameters. This PPT condition involves only the Frobenius norm of the adjacency matrix of the graph, the degrees of the vertices and the total number of vertices. For simple graphs, we obtain the range of the parameter $\alpha$ for which the $A_{\alpha}$-graph states represent a class of entangled states. We then develop a graph-theoretic formulation of a moments-based entanglement detection criterion, focusing on the recently proposed $p_3$-PPT criterion, which relies on the second and third moments of the partial transposition. Since the estimation of these moments is experimentally accessible via randomised measurements, swap operations, and machine-learning-based protocols, our approach provides a physically relevant framework for detecting entanglement in structured quantum states derived from graphs. This work bridges graph theory and moments-based entanglement detection, offering a new perspective on the role of combinatorial structures in quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Error mitigation for logical circuits using decoder confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.</description>

      <title>A random purification channel for arbitrary symmetries with applications to fermions and bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random purification channel maps n copies of any mixed quantum state to n copies of a random purification of the state. We generalize this construction to arbitrary symmetries: for any group G of unitaries, we construct a quantum channel that maps states contained in the algebra generated by G to random purifications obtained by twirling over G. In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states.</description>

      <title>Characterising the sets of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H\subseteq L^2(\mathbb R)$ we consider the convex sets $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ of Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e.~density matrices over $\mathcal H$ with non-negative Wigner function. We investigate the topological structure of these sets, namely concerning closure, compactness, interior and boundary (in a relative topology induced by the trace norm). We also study their geometric structure and construct minimal sets of states that generate $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ through convex combinations. If $\mathcal H$ is finite-dimensional, the existence of such sets follows from a central result in convex analysis, namely the Krein-Milman theorem. In the infinite-dimensional case $\mathcal H=L^2(\mathbb R)$ this is not so, due to lack of compactness of the set $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$. Nevertheless, we prove that a Krein-Milman theorem holds in this case, which allows us to extend most of the results concerning the sets of generators to the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we study the relation between the finite and infinite-dimensional sets of WPS, and prove that the former provide a hierarchy of closed subsets, which are also proper faces of the latter. These results provide a basis for an operational characterisation of the extreme points of the sets of WPS, which we undertake in a companion paper. Our work offers a unified perspective on the topological and geometric properties of the sets of WPS in finite and infinite dimensions, along with explicit constructions of minimal sets of generators.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Dicke States as Optimal Probes for Wave-Like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify symmetric Dicke states as the optimal quantum probes for distributed sensing of wave-like dark-matter fields. Within an ensemble-averaged quantum-metrological framework that incorporates the field's random phases and finite coherence, they maximize the Fisher information for short-baseline arrays with $N_d$ sensors and realize a robust $N_d^2$ enhancement. They also retain this collective advantage under amplitude-damping noise, whereas GHZ-type probes are highly fragile and rapidly lose their sensitivity once such noise is included. For two sensors at separations comparable to the dark-matter coherence length, the optimal entangled state acquires an additional spatial-correlation phase and outperforms both Dicke and independent probes. Our framework applies broadly to stochastic bosonic fields, including gravitational waves, and can be implemented with superconducting qubits, atomic ensembles, and NV centers.</description>

      <title>The fermion sign problem in Gauss law sectors of quantum link models with dynamical matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermion sign problem poses a formidable challenge to the use of Monte Carlo methods for lattice gauge theories with dynamical fermionic matter fields. A meron cluster algorithm recently formulated for gauge fields represented as spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum links coupled to a single flavour of staggered fermions samples only two of the exponentially many Gauss law (GL) sectors at low temperatures, making it possible to simulate either of those two GL sectors at zero temperature in polynomial time. In this article, we analytically identify GL sectors which can be simulated without encountering the fermion sign problem in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods, we further explore the nature of phases in the GL sectors dominating at zero temperature. The vacuum states lie in sectors which satisfy a staggered Gauss law, in contrast to the zero GL sector familiar in particle physics. Moreover, we prove that while the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, the usual zero-charge GL sector (often considered the physical sector) does. We outline the role of the magnetic energy in causing transitions between GL sectors. We expect our results to be valid for truncated Kogut-Susskind gauge theories, beyond quantum link models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the the large-$n$ dynamics of the long-range quantum $O(n)$ model, focusing on the strong long-range regime $\alpha&lt;d$. The dynamics of the model exhibits non-trivial features on mesoscopic timescales $t\sim\ln N$, due to the activation of parametric resonances of the nearly degenerate quantum modes. By using recent results establishing the integrability of the large-$n$ limit, we derive the resonance conditions, and construct the reduced multi-mode Hamiltonian that captures the finite-size dynamics. This framework yields the resonance phase diagram and clarifies when and how deviations from mean-field behavior arise. In particular, the presence of multiple resonant modes enhances the logarithmic growth of entanglement and leads to spatially modulated correlations.</description>

      <title>Exact formula for geometric quantum complexity of cosmological perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nielsen's geometric approach offers a powerful framework for quantifying the complexity of unitary transformations. In this formulation, complexity is defined as the length of the minimal geodesic in a suitably constructed geometric space associated with the Lie group of relevant operators. Despite its conceptual appeal, determining geodesic distances on Lie group manifolds is generally challenging, and existing treatments often rely on perturbative expansions in the structure constants. In this work, we circumvent these limitations by employing a finite-dimensional matrix representation of the generators, which enables an exact computation of the geodesic distance and hence a precise determination of the complexity. We focus on the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra, relevant for quantum scalar fields evolving on homogeneous and isotropic cosmological backgrounds. The resulting expression for the complexity is applied to de Sitter spacetime as well as to asymptotically static cosmological models undergoing contraction or expansion.</description>

Abstract: We present a spectroscopic investigation of $^{169}\mathrm{Tm}^+$ that provides two key foundations for its use as a platform for advanced quantum applications. First, we establish the complete spectroscopic road map for optical cycling (including laser cooling) by performing high-resolution spectroscopy on $^{169}\mathrm{Tm}^+$ ions in an ion trap. We characterize the primary $313\,\mathrm{nm}$ and complementary $448/453\,\mathrm{nm}$ cycling transitions, identify the essential near-infrared repumping frequencies, and determine the magnetic-dipole hyperfine $A$ constants for all relevant levels. Second, we report detailed characterization of a metastable state as a candidate for hosting a robust qubit, performing lifetime measurements and Zeeman-resolved microwave hyperfine spectroscopy with $\mathrm{kHz}$ precision.</description>

      <title>Sample-based quantum diagonalization as parallel fragment solver for the localized active space self-consistent field method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately and efficiently describing strongly correlated electronic systems is a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, with classical and quantum computers. The localized active space self-consistent field method (LASSCF) uses a product of fragment active spaces as a variational space, with the Schr\"odinger equation solved exactly in each fragment and the fragment active-space orbitals defined in a self-consistent manner. LASSCF is accurate for systems with strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlation, and its computational cost is combinatorial with respect to the size of the individual fragment active spaces, rather than their product. However, exactly solving the Schr\"odinger equation in each fragment remains a substantial bottleneck. Here, we address the possibility of solving the fragment active space Schr\"odinger equation with approximate methods, particularly sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD). SQD is a technique that uses a quantum computer to sample configurations from a chemically motivated quantum circuit and a classical computer to mitigate errors and solve the Schr\"odinger equation in a subspace of the configuration space. We apply the proposed method, LASSQD, to the [Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$]$_2$bpym$^{4+}$ compound and the [Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$($\mu$$_3$-O)-(HCOO)$_6$] complex for calculating the intermediate-spin ground state energies. We observe that LASSQD can tackle fragment sizes intractable by LASSCF, achieves within 1kcal/mol agreement to LASSCF, and delivers results that are competitive with alternative classical methods to solve the Schr\"odinger equation, and thus can be used as a starting point for a perturbative treatment (LASSQD-PDFT) to recover correlation external to the active space.</description>

Abstract: A molecular rotor mechanism is proposed to explain weak magnetic field effects in biology. Despite being nanoscale (1 nm), this rotor exhibits quantum superposition and interference. Analytical modeling shows its quantum dynamics are highly sensitive to weak, but not strong, magnetic fields. Due to its enhanced moment of inertia, the rotor maintains quantum coherence relatively long, even in a noisy cellular environment. Operating at the mesoscopic boundary between quantum and classical behavior, such a rotor embedded in cyclical biological processes could exert significant and observable biological influence.</description>

      <title>Two-Body Kapitza-Dirac Scattering of One-Dimensional Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kapitza-Dirac scattering, the diffraction of matter waves from a standing light field, is widely utilized in ultracold gases, but its behavior in the strongly interacting regime is an open question. Here we develop a numerically-exact two-body description of Kapitza-Dirac scattering for two contact-interacting atoms in a one-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to a pulsed optical lattice, enabling us to obtain the numerically exact dynamics. We map how interaction strength, lattice depth, lattice wavenumber, and pulse duration reshape the diffraction pattern, leading to an interaction-dependent population redistribution in real and momentum-space. By comparing the exact dynamics to an impulsive sudden-approximation description, we delineate the parameter regimes where it remains accurate and those, notably at strong attraction and small lattice wavenumber, where it fails. Our results provide a controlled few-body benchmark for interacting Kapitza-Dirac scattering and quantitative guidance for Kapitza-Dirac-based probes of ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Integrated on-chip quantum light sources on a van der Waals platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable photonic quantum information technologies require a platform combining quantum light sources, waveguides, and detectors on a single chip. Here, we introduce a van der Waals platform comprising strain-engineered bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, integrated on multimode WS$_2$ waveguides with optimized grating couplers, enabling efficient on-chip quantum light sources. The emitters exhibit bright, highly polarized emission that couples efficiently into WS$_2$ waveguides. Under resonant p-shell excitation, we observe high-purity, waveguide-coupled single-photon emission, measured using both an off-chip Hanbury Brown-Twiss configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.003^{+0.030}_{-0.003}$) and an on-chip configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.076\pm0.023$). For a single output, the out-coupled single-photon count rate at the first lens reaches approximately 320 kHz under continuous-wave p-shell excitation, corresponding to an estimated waveguide-coupled rate of 1.7 MHz. These results demonstrate an efficient, integrated single-photon source and establish a pathway toward scalable photonic quantum information processing centered around nanoengineered van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Consecutive-gap ratio distribution for crossover ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of spectrum statistics, such as the consecutive-gap ratio distribution, has revealed many interesting properties of many-body complex systems. Here we propose a two-parameter surmise expression for such distribution to describe the crossover between the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) and Poisson statistics. This crossover is observed in the isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local field, exhibiting the Many-Body Localization (MBL) transition. Inspired by the analysis of stability in dynamical systems, this crossover is presented as a flow pattern in the parameter space, with the Poisson statistics being the fixed point of the system, which represents the MBL phase. We also analyze an isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local exchange coupling and a zero magnetic field. In this case, the system never achieves the MBL phase because of the spin rotation symmetry. This case is more sensitive to finite-size effects than the previous one, and thus the flow pattern resembles a two-dimensional random walk close to its fixed point. We propose a system of linearized stochastic differential equations to estimate this fixed point. We study the continuous-state Markov process that governs the probability of finding the system close to this fixed point as the disorder strength increases. In addition, we discuss the conditions under which the stationary probability distribution is given by a bivariate normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous wave function collapse from non-local gravitational self-energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We incorporate non-local gravitational self-energy, motivated by string-inspired T-duality, into the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation. In this framework spacetime has an intrinsic non-locality, rendering the standard linear superposition principle only an approximation valid in the absence of gravitational effects. We then invert the logic by assuming the validity of linear superposition and demonstrate that such superpositions inevitably become unstable once gravity is included. The resulting wave-function collapse arises from a fundamental tension between the equivalence principle and the quantum superposition principle in a semiclassical spacetime background. We further show that wave functions computed in inertial and freely falling frames differ by a gravitationally induced phase shift containing linear and cubic time contributions along with a constant global term. These corrections produce a global phase change and lead to a spontaneous, model-independent collapse time inversely proportional to the mass of the system.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dynamical Scaling at Topological Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium driven dynamics at topologically nontrivial quantum critical points (QCPs),and find that topological edge modes at criticality give rise to anomalous universal dynamical scaling behavior. By analyzing the driven dynamics of bulk and boundary order parameters at topologically distinct Ising QCPs, we demonstrate that, while the bulk dynamics remain indistinguishable and follow standard Kibble Zurek (KZ) scaling, the anomalous boundary dynamics is unique to topological criticality, and its explanation goes beyond the traditional KZ mechanism. To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality. These findings establish the existence of anomalous dynamical scaling arising from the interplay between topology and driven dynamics, challenging standard paradigms of quantum critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Photonics-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonics can offer a hardware-native route for machine learning (ML). However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML.</description>

      <title>First-principles simulation of spin diffusion in static solids using dynamic mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of disordered nuclear spin ensembles are the subject of nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Due to the through-space long-range dipolar interaction generically many spins are involved in the time evolution, so that exact brute force calculations are impossible. The recently established spin dynamic mean-field theory (spinDMFT) represents an efficient and unbiased alternative to overcome this challenge. The approach only requires the dipolar couplings as input and the only prerequisite for its applicability is that each spin interacts with a large number of other spins. In this article, we show that spinDMFT can be used to describe spectral spin diffusion in static samples and to simulate zero-quantum line shapes which eluded an efficient quantitative simulation so far to the best of our knowledge. We perform benchmarks for two test substances that establish an excellent match with published experimental data. As spinDMFT combines low computational effort with high accuracy, we strongly suggest to use it for large-scale simulations of spin diffusion, which are important in various areas of magnetic resonance.</description>

      <title>An introduction to nonlinear fiber optics and optical analogues to gravitational phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical fiber is a revolutionary technology of the past century. It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Large Isolated Stripes on Short 18-leg $t$-$J$ Cylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-charge stripes belong to the most prominent low-temperature orders besides superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. This phase is particularly challenging to study numerically due to finite-size effects. By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Betti Numbers Using Cohomology Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological data analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale data. An abstract simplicial complex, in principle, can be built from data points, and by using tools from homology, topological features could be identified. Given a simplex, an important feature is called the Betti numbers, which roughly count the number of `holes' in different dimensions. Calculating Betti numbers exactly can be $\#$P-hard, and approximating them can be NP-hard, which rules out the possibility of any generic efficient algorithms and unconditional exponential quantum speedup. Here, we explore the specific setting of a triangulated manifold. In contrast to most known methods to estimate Betti numbers, which rely on homology, we exploit the `dual' approach, namely, cohomology, combining the insight of the Hodge theory and de Rham cohomology. Our proposed algorithm can calculate its $r$-th normalized Betti number $\beta_r/|S_r|$ up to some additive error $\epsilon$ with running time $\mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\log(|S_r^K| |S_{r+1}^K|)}{\epsilon^2} \log (\log |S_r^K|) \big( r\log |S_r^K| \big) \Big)$, where $|S_r|$ is the number of $r$-simplexes in the given complex. For the estimation of $r$-th Betti number $\beta_r$ to a chosen multiplicative accuracy $\epsilon'$, our algorithm has complexity $ \mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\log(|S_r^K| |S_{r+1}^K|)}{\epsilon'^2} \big( \frac{ \Gamma}{\beta_r}\big)^2 (\log |S_r^K|) \log \big( r\log |S_r^K| \big) \Big)$, where $\Gamma \leq |S_r^K|$ can be chosen. A detailed analysis is provided, showing that our cohomology framework can even perform exponentially faster than previous homology methods in several regimes. In particular, our method is most effective when $\beta_r \ll |S_r^K|$, which can offer more flexibility and practicability than existing quantum algorithms that achieve the best performance in the regime $\beta_r \approx |S_r^K|$.</description>

      <title>Enigma: Application-Layer Privacy for Quantum Optimization on Untrusted Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Early Fault-Tolerant (EFT) era is emerging, where modest Quantum Error Correction (QEC) can enable quantum utility before full-scale fault tolerance. Quantum optimization is a leading candidate for early applications, but protecting these workloads is critical since they will run on expensive cloud services where providers could learn sensitive problem details. Experience with classical computing systems has shown that treating security as an afterthought can lead to significant vulnerabilities. Thus, we must address the security implications of quantum computing before widespread adoption. However, current Secure Quantum Computing (SQC) approaches, although theoretically promising, are impractical in the EFT era: blind quantum computing requires large-scale quantum networks, and quantum homomorphic encryption depends on full QEC.
  We propose application-specific SQC, a principle that applies obfuscation at the application layer to enable practical deployment while remaining agnostic to algorithms, computing models, and hardware architectures. We present Enigma, the first realization of this principle for quantum optimization. Enigma integrates three complementary obfuscations: ValueGuard scrambles coefficients, StructureCamouflage inserts decoys, and TopologyTrimmer prunes variables. These techniques guarantee recovery of original solutions, and their stochastic nature resists repository-matching attacks. Evaluated against seven state-of-the-art AI models across five representative graph families, even combined adversaries, under a conservatively strong attacker model, identify the correct problem within their top five guesses in only 4.4% of cases. The protections come at the cost of problem size and T-gate counts increasing by averages of 1.07x and 1.13x, respectively, with both obfuscation and decoding completing within seconds for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Yield of Bucket Brigade Quantum Random Access Memory using Redundancy Repair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Random Access Memory (qRAM) is an essential computing element for running oracle-based quantum algorithms. qRAM exploits quantum superposition to access all data stored in the memory cells simultaneously and guarantees the superior performance of quantum algorithms. A qRAM memory cell comprises logical qubits encoded through quantum error correction technology for successful operation against various quantum noises. In addition to quantum noise, the low-technology nodes based on silicon technology can increase the qubit density and may introduce defective qubits. As qRAM comprises many qubits, its yield will be reduced by defective qubits; these qubits must be handled using QEC scheme. However, the QEC scheme requires numerous physical qubits, which burdens resource overhead. In this paper, to resolve this overhead problem, we propose a novel quantum memory architecture that compensates for defective qubits by introducing redundant qubits. We also analyze the yield improvement offered by our proposed quantum memory architecture by varying the ideal fabrication error rate from 0.5% to 1% for different numbers of logical qubits in the qRAM. We demonstrate that for the qRAM comprising 1,024 logical qubits, eight redundant logical qubits improved the yield by 95.92% from that of qRAM not employing the redundant repair scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the status of quantum probabilities in light of Kolmogorovian Censorship (KC) and the Contexts, Systems and Modalities (CSM) framework, and we compare KC-based frameworks with alternatives such as superdeterminism, supermeasurements, and predictive incompleteness. After briefly recalling the technical content of KC and its scope, we show that KC correctly identifies that probabilities are classical within a fixed measurement context but does not by itself remove the conceptual tension that motivates nonlocal or conspiratorial explanations of Bell-inequality violations. We argue that predictive incompleteness - the view that the quantum state is operationally incomplete until the measurement context is specified - provides a simple, minimal, and explanatory framework that preserves relativistic locality while matching experimental practice. Finally we clarify logical relations among these positions, highlight the assumptions behind them, and justify the move from Kolmogorov's to Gleason's framework for quantum probabilities.</description>

Abstract: The theory of quantum thermodynamics investigates how the concepts of heat, work, and temperature can be carried over to the quantum realm, where fluctuations and randomness are fundamentally unavoidable. These lecture notes provide an introduction to the thermodynamics of small quantum systems. It is illustrated how the laws of thermodynamics emerge from quantum theory and how open quantum systems can be modeled by Markovian master equations. Quantum systems that are designed to perform a certain task, such as cooling or generating entanglement are considered. Finally, the effect of fluctuations on the thermodynamic description is discussed.</description>

      <title>Faster Quantum Simulation Of Markovian Open Quantum Systems Via Randomisation</title>

Abstract: When simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with quantum computers, it is essential to accurately approximate the system's behaviour while preserving the physicality of its evolution. Traditionally, for Markovian open quantum systems, this has been achieved using first and second-order Trotter-Suzuki product formulas or probabilistic algorithms. In this work, we introduce novel non-probabilistic algorithms for simulating Markovian open quantum systems using randomisation. Our methods, including first and second-order randomised Trotter-Suzuki formulas and the QDRIFT channel, not only maintain the physicality of the system's evolution but also enhance the scalability and precision of quantum simulations. We derive error bounds and step count limits for these techniques, bypassing the need for the mixing lemma typically employed in Hamiltonian simulation proofs. We also present two implementation approaches for these randomised algorithms: classical sampling and quantum forking, demonstrating their gate complexity advantages over deterministic Trotter-Suzuki product formulas. This work is the first to apply randomisation techniques to the simulation of open quantum systems, highlighting their potential to enable faster and more accurate simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

Abstract: As standard data loading processes, quantum state preparation and block-encoding are critical and necessary processes for quantum computing applications, including quantum machine learning, Hamiltonian simulation, and many others. Yet, existing protocols suffer from poor robustness under device imperfection, thus limiting their practicality for real-world applications. Here, this limitation is overcome based on a fanin process designed in a tree-like bucket-brigade architecture. It suppresses the error propagation between different branches, thus exponentially improving the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. Moreover, the approach here simultaneously achieves the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant circuit depth, gate count, and STA. As an example of application, we show that for quantum simulation of geometrically local Hamiltonian, the code distance of each logic qubit can potentially be reduced exponentially using our technique. We believe that our technique can significantly enhance the power of quantum computing in the near-term and fault-tolerant regimes.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulations of the Non-Resonant Open Tavis-Cummings Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The open Tavis--Cummings model consists of $N$ quantum emitters interacting with a common cavity mode, accounts for losses and decoherence, and is frequently explored for quantum information processing and designing quantum devices. As $N$ increases, it becomes harder to simulate the open Tavis--Cummings model using traditional methods. To address this problem, we implement two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of this model in the inhomogeneous, non-resonant regime, with up to three excitations in the cavity. We show that the implemented algorithms have gate complexities that scale polynomially, as $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$, while the number of qubits used by these algorithms (space complexity) scales linearly as $O(N)$. One of these algorithms is the sampling-based wave matrix Lindbladization algorithm, for which we propose two protocols to implement its system-independent fixed interaction, resolving key open questions of [Patel and Wilde, Open Sys. &amp; Info. Dyn., 30:2350014 (2023)]. We benchmark our results against a classical differential equation solver in a variety of scenarios and demonstrate that our algorithms accurately reproduce the expected dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Accurately estimating properties of quantum states, such as entanglement, while essential for the development of quantum technologies, remains a challenging task. Standard approaches to property estimation rely on detailed modeling of the measurement apparatus and a priori assumptions on their working principles. Even small deviations can greatly affect reconstruction accuracy and prediction reliability. Here, we demonstrate that quantum reservoir computing embodies a powerful alternative for witnessing quantum entanglement and, more generally, estimating quantum features from experimental data. We leverage the orbital angular momentum of photon pairs as an ancillary degree of freedom to enable informationally complete single-setting measurements of their polarization. Our approach does not require fine-tuning or refined knowledge of the setup, at the same time outperforming conventional approaches. It automatically adapts to noise and imperfections while avoiding overfitting, ensuring robust reconstruction of entanglement witnesses and paving the way to the assessment of quantum features of experimental multiparty states.</description>

      <title>The Octo-Rail Lattice: a four-dimensional cluster state design</title>

Abstract: Macronode cluster states are promising for fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation, combining gate teleportation via homodyne detection with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code for universality and error correction. While the two-dimensional Quad-Rail Lattice offers flexibility and low noise, it lacks the dimensionality required for topological error correction codes essential for fault tolerance. This work presents a four-dimensional cluster state, termed the Octo-Rail Lattice, generated using time-domain multiplexing. This new macronode design combines the noise properties and flexibility of the Quad-Rail Lattice with the possibility to run various topological error correction codes including surface and color codes. Besides, the presented experimental setup is easily scalable and includes only static optical components allowing for a straight-forward implementation. Analysis demonstrates that the Octo-Rail Lattice, when combined with GKP qunaught states and the surface code, exhibits noise performance compatible with a fault-tolerant threshold of 9.75 dB squeezing. This ensures universality and fault-tolerance without requiring additional resources such as other non-Gaussian states or feed-forward operations. This finding implies that the primary challenge in constructing an optical quantum computer lies in the experimental generation of these highly non-classical states. Finally, a generalisation of the design to arbitrary dimensions is introduced, where the setup size scales linearly with the number of dimensions. This general framework holds promise for applications such as state multiplexing and state injection.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with solid-state spin sensors is a promising pathway for the detection of nuclear spins at the micro- and nanoscale. Although many nanoscale experiments rely on a single sensor spin for the detection of the signal, leveraging spin ensembles can enhance sensitivity, particularly in cases in which the signal merely originates from statistically polarized nuclear spins. In this work, we introduce multipoint correlation spectroscopy, that combines the advantages of two well-established methods -- correlation spectroscopy and quantum heterodyne detection -- to enable temporally efficient measurements of statistically polarized samples at the nanoscale with spin ensembles. We present a theoretical framework for this approach and demonstrate an experimental proof of concept with a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. We achieve single hertz uncertainty in the estimated signal frequency, highlighting the potential applications of the technique for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance.</description>

      <title>Improving Variational Quantum Circuit Optimization via Hybrid Algorithms and Random Axis Initialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are an essential tool in applying noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers to practical problems. VQCs are used as a central component in many algorithms, for example, in quantum machine learning, optimization, and quantum chemistry. Several methods have been developed to optimize VQCs. In this work, we enhance the performance of the well-known Rotosolve method, a gradient-free optimization algorithm specifically designed for VQCs. We develop two hybrid algorithms that combine an improved version of Rotosolve with the free quaternion selection (FQS) algorithm, which is the main focus of this study. Through numerical simulations, we observe that these hybrid algorithms achieve higher accuracy and better average performance across different ansatz circuit sizes and cost functions. For shallow variational circuits, we identify a trade-off between the expressivity of the variational ansatz and the speed of convergence to the optimum: a more expressive ansatz ultimately reaches a closer approximation to the true minimum, but at the cost of requiring more circuit evaluations for convergence. By combining the less expressive but fast-converging Rotosolve with the more expressive FQS, we construct hybrid algorithms that benefit from the rapid initial convergence of Rotosolve while leveraging the superior expressivity of FQS. As a result, these hybrid approaches outperform either method used independently.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate that the crucial issue of diverging timescales in dissipative state preparation is largely tantamount to an asymptotic approach towards the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. With case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Formally treating the weight $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat exchanged between an open quantum system and its environment exhibits fluctuations that carry crucial signatures of the underlying dynamics. Within the well-established two-point measurement scheme, we identify a 'heat operator,' whose moments with respect to the vacuum state of a thermofield-doubled Hilbert space correspond to the stochastic moments of the heat exchanged with a bath. This recasts heat statistics as a unitary time evolution problem, which we solve by combining chain-mapped reservoirs with tensor network propagation. In a multi-bath setup all total and bath-resolved heat moments then follow from a single pure state evolution. We employ this approach to compute transient and steady state heat fluctuations in Ohmic spin-boson models in and out of equilibrium, accessing the challenging low temperature and long memory time regimes of the environment. In the nonequilibrium case, we show a crossover in the Fano factor from super-Poissonian to nearly Poissonian statistics under strong coupling asymmetry, corresponding to thermal rectification behavior. The method applies to noninteracting (bosonic or fermionic) nonequilibrium environments with arbitrary spectral densities, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: By means of Trotter's formula, we show that transition amplitudes between a class of generalized coherent states in the Rabi model can be understood in terms of a certain Ising model featuring long-range interactions beyond nearest neighbors in its thermodynamic limit. Specifically, we relate the transition amplitudes in the Rabi model to a sum over binary variables of the form of a partition function of an Ising model with a number of spin sites equal to the number of steps in Trotter's formula applied to the real-time evolution of the Rabi model. From this, we show that a perturbative expansion in the energy splitting of the two-level subsystem in the Rabi model is equivalent to an expansion in the number of spin domains in the Ising model. We conclude by discussing how calculations in one model give nontrivial information about the other model, and vice versa, as well as applications and generalizations this correspondence may find.</description>

Abstract: Light-matter interactions with quantum dots have been extensively studied to harness key quantum properties of photons, such as indistinguishability and entanglement. In this theoretical work, we exploit the atomic-like four-level structure of a quantum dot coupled to a waveguide to model a shaping frequency entangling gate (FrEnGATE) for single photons. Our approach is based on the identification of input frequencies and an atomic level structure for which frequency-dependent one-photon transitions are adiabatically eliminated, while frequency-dependent two-photon transitions are resonantly enhanced. The frequency entanglement performance of the gate is analyzed using a Schmidt decomposition for continuous variables, revealing a trade-off between entanglement generation efficiency and entanglement quality. We further demonstrate the use of the FrEnGATE for the generation of entangled frequency qudit states.</description>

      <title>Walsh-Floquet Theory of Periodic Kick Drives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic kick drives are ubiquitous in digital quantum control, computation, and simulation, and are instrumental in studies of chaos and thermalization for their efficient representation through discrete gates. However, in the commonly used Fourier basis, kick drives lead to poor convergence of physical quantities. Instead, here we use the Walsh basis of periodic square-wave functions to describe the physics of periodic kick drives. In the strongly kicked regime, we find that it recovers Floquet dynamics of single- and many-body systems more accurately than the Fourier basis, due to the shape of the system's response in time. To understand this behavior, we derive an extended Sambe space formulation and an inverse-frequency expansion in the Walsh basis. We explain the enhanced performance within the framework of single-particle localization on the frequency lattice, where localization is correlated with small truncation errors. We show that strong hybridization between states of the kicked system and Walsh modes gives rise to Walsh polaritons that can be studied on digital quantum simulators. Our work lays the foundations of Walsh-Floquet theory, which is naturally implementable on digital quantum devices and suited to Floquet state manipulation using discrete gates.</description>

      <title>Measurement-free quantum error correction optimized for biased noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive optimized measurement-free protocols for quantum error correction and the implementation of a universal gate set optimized for an error model that is noise biased . The noise bias is adapted for neutral atom platforms, where two- and multi-qubit gates are realized with Rydberg interactions and are thus expected to be the dominating source of noise. Careful design of the gates allows to further reduce the noise model to Pauli-Z errors. In addition, the presented circuits are robust to arbitrary single-qubit gate errors, and we demonstrate that the break-even point can be significantly improved compared to fully fault-tolerant measurement-free schemes. The obtained logical qubits with their suppressed error rates on logical gate operations can then be used as building blocks in a first step of error correction in order to push the effective error rates below the threshold of a fully fault-tolerant and scalable quantum error correction scheme.</description>

      <title>Certification of High-Dimensional Entanglement Within the Resource Theory of Buscemi Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement, captured by the Schmidt number, underpins advantages in quantum information tasks, yet a unified resource-theoretic description across different Buscemi-type operational objects has been missing. Here we develop a convex framework that treats bipartite states, distributed measurements, and teleportation instruments generated from shared entanglement on equal footing. For a fixed Schmidt-number threshold k, we introduce robustness-based monotones for each class of objects and prove a quantitative collapse: the Schmidt-number robustness of a bipartite state coincides with the maximal robustness achievable by any distributed measurement or teleportation instrument derived from that state. Consequently, within Buscemi-type operational frameworks, these objects do not carry independent high-dimensional resources but are governed by a single robustness-based monotone. We further provide a direct operational interpretation by relating this unique quantifier to the optimal advantage in entanglement-assisted state discrimination games. Our results complete a unified resource-theoretic characterization of high-dimensional entanglement across states, measurements, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Overtone Rabi oscillation of optically polarized triplet electron spins and nuclear hyperpolarization in powder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report coherent overtone Rabi oscillations of optically-polarized triplet electron spins and nuclear hyperpolarization in powder samples at room temperature. The strong dependence of the single-quantum resonance on the orientation of the zero-field splitting (ZFS) interaction is overcome by coherently driving the significantly narrower overtone transition. Analytical formulas for the overtone lineshape and nutation functions for axially symmetric ZFS interactions are derived. Overtone Rabi oscillations are observed in pentacene-doped \textit{p}-terphenyl and NV$^-$ centers in microdiamonds. For the former, overtone triplet dynamic nuclear polarization using the integrated solid effect leads to $^1$H spin polarization of $0.183\pm0.005$\% at a magnetic field of 0.2~T. The $^1$H NMR polarization is enhanced by a factor of 2600 with respect to thermal equilibrium and reaches a large portion of the randomly oriented microcrystals.</description>

      <title>Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators ($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.</description>

      <title>Circular-beam approximation for quantum channels in a turbulent atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum states of light in free-space channels is strongly influenced by atmospheric turbulence, posing a significant challenge for quantum communication. The transmittance in such channels randomly fluctuates. This effect is commonly described by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT). The elliptic-beam approximation provides an analytical model for the PDT, showing good agreement with experimental and simulation data within a specific range of channel parameters. In this work, we introduce the circular-beam approximation -- a simplified alternative that offers satisfactory accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity. Our method naturally leads to a technique for determining the model parameters from the first two moments of the transmittance. This approach eliminates the model misspecification bias inherent in the elliptic-beam approximation and significantly extends the applicability range of the PDT model, providing a practical tool for characterizing atmospheric channels in quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Mutually equibiased bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one basis gives \emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another basis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes to be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution $q=(q_0,\ldots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is preserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any preparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is chosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect to the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In light of this, we define the notion of \emph{mutually equibiased bases} (MEBs) such that within each basis the states are equibiased with respect to the states of the other basis and that the bases are mutually equibiased with respect to each other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual equibiasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading for $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\le\mu \le 1/2$ where $\mu=\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements in MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective measurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty inequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated entanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed from MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same number of bases, for certain values of the index $\mu$, employing a larger set of MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic states of a $3\times 3$ system. Our results reveal that not all bases in a set of $L$ MEBs can contribute to the entanglement detection.

      <title>Non-unique decompositions of mixed states and deterministic energy transfers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of non-unique decompositions of mixed states on energy transfer. Mixed states generally have non-unique decompositions into pure states in quantum theory and, by definition, in other non-classical probabilistic theories. We consider energy transfers constituting deterministic energy harvesting, wherein the source transfers energy to the harvester but not entropy. We use the possibility of non-unique decompositions to derive that if source states in a set jointly lead to deterministic energy harvesting for the given harvesting system and interaction, then that set can be expanded to include both mixtures and superpositions of the original states in the set. As a paradigmatic example, we model the source as an EM mode transferring energy to a 2-level system harvester via the Jaynes-Cummings model. We show that the set of coherent EM mode states with fixed $|\alpha|$ that jointly achieve deterministic energy transfer can be expanded to include all mixtures and superpositions of those states. More generally, the results link the defining feature of a non-classical probability theory with the ability to achieve energy transfer without entropy transfer.</description>

      <title>Construction of PPT entangled state and its detection by using second-order moment of the partial transposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adopt a formalism by which we construct and detect a new family of positive partial transpose entangled states in $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional system. Our detection method is based on the second order moment $p_2(\rho^{T_B})$ as it is very easy to calculate and may be realizable in laboratory. We show that if the second order moment $p_2(\rho^{T_B})$ in $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional system satisfy $p_2(\rho^{T_B})\leq\frac{1}{d_1 d_2-1}$, then the state is a PPT state. We also derive an equivalent condition on the bloch vector. Then, we construct a quantum state by considering the mixture of a separable and an entangled state and obtain a condition on the mixing parameter for which the mixture represents a PPTES. Finally, applying our results, we have shown that the distillable key rate of the private state, prepared through our prescription, is positive. It suggests that our result also has potential applications in quantum cryptography.</description>

Abstract: Optimization via decoded quantum interferometry (DQI) has recently gained a great deal of attention as a promising avenue for solving optimization problems using quantum computers. In this paper, we apply DQI to an industrial optimization problem in the automotive industry: the vehicle option-package pricing problem. Our main contributions are 1) formulating the industrial problem as an integer linear program (ILP), 2) converting the ILP into instances of max-XORSAT, and 3) developing a detailed quantum circuit implementation for belief propagation, a heuristic algorithm for decoding LDPC codes. Thus, we provide a full implementation of the DQI algorithm using Belief Propagation, which can be applied to any industrially relevant ILP by first transforming it into a max-XORSAT instance. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our implementation by benchmarking it against both Gurobi and a random sampling baseline.</description>

Abstract: Extracting information from weak optical signals is a critical challenge across a broad range of technologies. Conventional imaging techniques, constrained to integrating over detected signals and classical post-processing, are limited in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from shot noise accumulation in the post-processing algorithms. We show that these limitations can be circumvented by coherently encoding photonic amplitude information into qubit registers and applying quantum algorithms to process the stored information from asynchronously arriving optical signals. As a specific example, we develop a quantum algorithm for imaging unresolved point sources and apply it to exoplanet detection. We demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance can be achieved under realistic imaging conditions using relatively small scale quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a simple and systematic way to certify any given bipartite state as the unique joint $1$-eigenstate of two separable projectors, each of which can be measured with simple local observables. This is practically useful, as the detection probabilities of the two stabilizer projectors relate directly to the fidelity of certification. The same result gives a simple and effective lower bound on the entanglement fidelity of a quantum channel in terms of two ensemble fidelities.
  We then generalise the bipartite result recursively to multipartite systems, showing that every $n$-party pure state is the unique joint $1$-eigenstate of $2^{n-1}$ separable projectors, and an upper bound of the infidelity of the state in terms of the infidelities of the separable stabilizer projectors.</description>

Abstract: Atomic sensors using light-matter interactions, in particular atomic clocks and atom interferometers, have the potential to complement optical gravitational-wave detectors in the mid-frequency regime. Although both rely on interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated, whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions, while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work, we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave. While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial optical clocks usually rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise suppression.</description>

Abstract: We show that it is undecidable to determine whether the commuting operator value of a nonlocal game is strictly greater than 1/2. As a corollary, there is a boolean constraint system (BCS) game for which the value of the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy does not attain the commuting operator value at any finite level. Our contribution involves establishing a computable mapping from Turing machines to BCS nonlocal games in which the halting property of the machine is encoded as a decision problem for the commuting operator value of the game. Our techniques are algebraic and distinct from those used to establish MIP*=RE.</description>

Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</description>

      <title>A Fractional Calculus Framework for Open Quantum Dynamics: From Liouville to Lindblad to Memory Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems exhibit dynamics ranging from unitary evolution to irreversible dissipation. While the Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) equation uniquely characterizes Markovian CPTP evolution, many physical platforms display non-Markovian features such as algebraic relaxation and coherence backflow. Fractional calculus provides a natural way to model such long-memory behavior through power-law temporal kernels introduced by fractional time derivatives. Here we develop a unified framework that embeds fractional master equations within the broader hierarchy of open-system formalisms. The fractional equation forms a structured subclass of memory-kernel models, reduces to the Lindblad form at unit order, and, through Bochner--Phillips subordination, admits a CPTP representation as an average over Lindblad semigroups. Its resolvent structure further connects fractional dynamics to established non-Markovian approaches, including Nakajima--Zwanzig kernels and hierarchical equations of motion, providing a compact surrogate for long-memory effects. This formulation positions fractional calculus as a rigorous and practical language for quantum dynamics with intrinsic memory, supporting both analytical insight and efficient quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Evidence for unexpectedly low quasiparticle generation rates across Josephson junctions of driven superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs) of superconducting qubits (SCQs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing (FTSQC). Nonetheless, quantitative experimental estimation on QPG rates has remained vague. Here, we investigate QPG using strongly driven SCQs, reaching qubit drive amplitudes up to $2\pi\times$300 GHz by applying intense drive fields through the readout resonators. The resonator nonlinear responses enable quantification of the energy loss at SCQs, including the contribution from QPG. Surprisingly, the estimated total energy loss rates are far lower than those expected by the Floquet-Markov formalism with QPG as the sole loss mechanism. Meanwhile, calculations that incorporate high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) in the QPG conductance at approximately 17-20 GHz effectively explain the experimental observations. These results suggest limitations in either the QPG conductance model or the Markovian treatment of the QPG processes. Both possibilities possess crucial implications for handling QPG problems toward FTSQC and for a more deeper understanding of Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Iteratively Enhanced Room-Temperature Single-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-performance photon detection is indispensable in a wide range of quantum-optical applications and is conventionally treated as a fixed device-level operation based on single-photon detectors (SPDs). However, state-of-the-art SPDs rely on superconducting materials, which impose severe technological demands and require challenging operational conditions such as cryogenic cooling, thereby hindering scalable implementation. Here, we propose the enhanced single-photon detector (ESPD) framework, a theoretical paradigm supported by numerical simulations, that reformulates single-photon detection as an iteratively enhanced process based on state preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy analysis, and enables substantial performance improvement using exclusively room-temperature components. Numerical simulations indicate that, within a physically motivated parameter regime, the ESPD framework can upgrade a legacy SPD with a detection efficiency (DE) of about 59% and a dark count rate (DCR) of about $10^{-2}$ to effective performance metrics with DE exceeding 93% and DCR below $10^{-9}$, comparable to those of superconducting SPDs. As a consequence, the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for quantum key distribution protocols can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. While its physical realization would require substantial experimental integration, the ESPD framework establishes a general system-level perspective on photon detection, highlighting the potential of iterative quantum processing for overcoming intrinsic detector limitations at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Estimating Local Observables via Cluster-Level Light-Cone Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating large quantum circuits on hardware with limited qubit counts is often attempted through methods like circuit knitting, which typically incur sample costs that grow exponentially with the number of connections cut. In this work, we introduce a framework based on Cluster-level Light-cone analysis that leverages the natural locality of quantum workloads. We propose two complementary algorithms: the Causal Decoupling Algorithm, which exploits geometric disconnections in the light cone for sampling efficiency, and the Algebraic Decomposition Algorithm, which utilizes algebraic expansion to minimize hardware requirements. These methods allow simulation costs to depend on circuit depth and connectivity rather than system size. Together, our results generalize Lieb-Robinson-inspired locality to modular architectures and establish a quantitative framework for probing local physics on near-term quantum devices by decoupling the simulation cost from the global system size.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Optimal Driven Allocation for Scalable QEC Decoder Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) requires fast and accurate decoding of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) syndromes. However, in large-scale systems, the number of available decoders is much smaller than the number of logical qubits, leading to a fundamental resource shortage. To address this limitation, Virtualized Quantum Decoder (VQD) architectures have been proposed to share a limited pool of decoders across multiple qubits. While the Minimize Longest Undecoded Sequence (MLS) heuristic has been introduced as an effective scheduling policy within the VQD framework, its locally greedy decision-making structure limits its ability to consider global circuit structure, causing inefficiencies in resource balancing and limited scalability. In this work, we propose Constraint-Optimal Driven Allocation (CODA), an optimization-based scheduling algorithm that leverages global circuit structure to minimize the longest undecoded sequence length. Across 19 benchmark circuits, CODA achieves an average 74\% reduction in the longest undecoded sequence length. Crucially, while the theoretical search space scales exponentially with circuit size, CODA effectively bypasses this combinatorial explosion. Our evaluation confirms that the scheduling time scales linearly with the number of qubits, determined by physical resource constraints rather than the combinatorial search space, ensuring robust scalability for large-scale FTQC systems. These results demonstrate that CODA provides a global optimization-based, scalable scheduling solution that enables efficient decoder virtualization in large-scale FTQC systems.</description>

      <title>Highly robust logical qubit encoding in an ensemble of V-symmetrical qutrits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose using even and odd Sch\"odinger cat states formed from coherent states of U(3) of an ensemble of qutrits with a symmetrical V-configuration (a qubit-disguised qutrit) to encode a logical qubit. These carefully engineered logical qubit states are parameter independent stationary states of the effective master equation governing the evolution of the ensemble and, consequently, constitute dark states and are invulnerable to dissipation and correlated collective dephasing. In particular, the logical qubit states are immune to single qutrit decay (the analogous of single photon loss process for qutrits) and simultaneous decay and driving of two qutrits (the analogous two-photon loss and driving processes for qutrits). In addition, we show how to implement the single-qubit quantum NOT gate and the Hadamard gate followed by either the phase gate or the phase and $Z$ gates. We study analytically the case of two qutrits and conclude that the logical qubit states exhibit parity-sensitive inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing: the even logical state is completely immune to these processes, while odd one is vulnerable. Nevertheless, in the presence of these interactions one can also define another odd state with mixed permutation symmetry that is immune to both inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing. We suggest that these results can be extrapolated to an arbitrary number of qutrits. The effective master equation is deduced from a physical system composed of two parametrically coupled cavities with one of them interacting dispersively with an ensemble of three-level atoms (the qutrits). In principle this physical system can be implemented by means of two coplanar waveguide resonators, a SQUID parametrically coupling them, and a cloud of alkali atoms close to one of the resonators.</description>

      <title>Beam search decoder for quantum LDPC codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a decoder for quantum low density parity check (LDPC) codes based on a beam search heuristic guided by belief propagation (BP). Our beam search decoder applies to all quantum LDPC codes and achieves different speed-accuracy tradeoffs by tuning its parameters such as the beam width. We perform numerical simulations under circuit level noise for the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle (BB) code at noise rate $p=10^{-3}$ to estimate the logical error rate and the 99.9 percentile runtime and we compare with the BP-OSD decoder which has been the default quantum LDPC decoder for the past six years. A variant of our beam search decoder with a beam width of 64 achieves a $17\times$ reduction in logical error rate. With a beam width of 8, we reach the same logical error rate as BP-OSD with a $26.2\times$ reduction in the 99.9 percentile runtime. We identify the beam search decoder with beam width of 32 as a promising candidate for trapped ion architectures because it achieves a $5.6\times$ reduction in logical error rate with a 99.9 percentile runtime per syndrome extraction round below 1ms at $p=5 \times10^{-4}$. Remarkably, this is achieved in software on a single core, without any parallelization or specialized hardware (FPGA, ASIC), suggesting one might only need three 32-core CPUs to decode a trapped ion quantum computer with 1000 logical qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Processes with indefinite causal order can arise when quantum theory is locally valid. Here, we identify an information-theoretic principle, termed parity erasure, that completely characterizes such processes. Our characterization does not rely on the formalism of quantum theory itself, but instead is derived from a set of axioms for general operational probabilistic theories, and thus holds also for a large class of theories beyond quantum theory. This informational approach reveals a fundamental property of information exchange in scenarios with indefinite causal structure.</description>

      <title>Insensitivity points and performance of open quantum interferometers under number-conserving &amp; non-conserving Lindblad dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a linear two-mode atom interferometer subject to environmental noise, modeled within the framework of open quantum systems with both number-conserving and non-conserving Lindblad operators. Considering several input states, we first study the cases N=1,2 (N number of particles) and perform numerical simulations for N&gt;2. The sensitivity as a function of the holding time can display divergence points where phase estimation becomes impossible, to which we refer as insensitivity points. We characterize their behavior as the input state, particle number, and noise operator are varied, and we find that their positions are independent of the noise intensity. Moreover, while our fixed measurement scheme may favor number-conserving noise at small N (i.e., having better sensitivity), the Cram\'er-Rao bound reveals that particle non-conserving noise yields strictly lower achievable sensitivity for all particle numbers.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic and Operational Measures of Quantum Contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an information -- theoretic framework for quantifying Kochen-Specker contextuality. Two complementary measures are introduced: the mutual information energy, a state-independent quantity inspired by Onicescu's information energy that captures the geometric overlap between joint eigenspaces within a context; and an operational measure based on commutator expectation values that reflects contextual behavior at the level of measurement outcomes. We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicio\u{g}lu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound on dynamical exponents in gapless frustration-free systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to variational Quantum algorithms (VQA) via continuous bandits. VQA are a class of hybrid Quantum-classical algorithms where the parameters of Quantum circuits are optimized by classical algorithms. Previous work has used zero and first order gradient based methods, however such algorithms suffer from the barren plateau (BP) problem where gradients and loss differences are exponentially small. We introduce an approach using bandits methods which combine global exploration with local exploitation. We show how VQA can be formulated as a best arm identification problem in a continuous space of arms with Lipschitz smoothness. While regret minimization has been addressed in this setting, existing methods for pure exploration only cover discrete spaces. We give the first results for pure exploration in a continuous setting and derive a fixed-confidence, information-theoretic, instance specific lower bound. Under certain assumptions on the expected payoff, we derive a simple algorithm, which is near-optimal with respect to our lower bound. Finally, we apply our continuous bandit algorithm to two VQA schemes: a PQC and a QAOA quantum circuit, showing that we significantly outperform the previously known state of the art methods (which used gradient based methods).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that special and general theories of relativity implicitly assume spacetime events correspond to quantum measurement outcomes. This leads to a change in how one should view the equivalence of spacetime and gravity. We describe a Bell test using time-like measurements that indicates a non classical causal structure that does not violate no-signaling. From this perspective, the violation of the Bell inequalities are already evidence for the non classical structure of flat spacetime as seen by an agent embedded in it. We argue that spacetime geometry can be learned by an embedded agent with internal actuators and sensors making internal measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a method to compute approximations to temporal correlation functions of few-body observables in chaotic many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit based on the respective Lanczos coefficients. Given the knowledge of these Lanczos coefficients, the method is very cheap. Usually accuracy increases with more Lanczos coefficients taken into account, however, we numerically find and analytically argue that the convergence is rather quick, if the Lanczos coefficients exhibit a smoothly increasing structure. For pertinent examples we compare with data from dynamical typicality computations for large but finite systems and find good agreement if few Lanczos coefficients are taken into account. From the method it is evident that in these cases the correlation functions are well described by a low number of damped oscillations.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$ is a given mode and subsystem $B$ is the rest of the system. For initial pure states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Interestingly, this last method offers notable computational efficiency. However, partner modes do not commute, due to the nontrivial multimode entanglement structure. Hence, a pairwise description will not be suitable for describing the full system. Besides, our findings reveal that the expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. We checked that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases toward the ultraviolet modes, indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. Besides the initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated. Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond the validity of our numerical algorithms. We conclude with a discussion about the possible implementation and observation of our results in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>The Bose-Hubbard polaron from weak to strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an exact evaluation of the out-of-time correlation (OTOC) functions for the localized $f$-particle states in the Falicov-Kimball model within dynamical mean-field theory. Different regimes of quantum chaos and quantum scrambling are distinguished by the winding numbers of the block Toeplitz matrices used in the calculation. The similarities of these fermionic OTOCs and their logarithmic derivatives for time evolution with the OTOCs for quantum spin models with disorder are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors</title>

Abstract: The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</description>

      <title>Optical Vortices: Revolutionizing the field of linear and nonlinear optics</title>

Abstract: Light is the fundamental medium through which we perceive the world around us. In the modern era, light can not only be used in its raw form but can also be used as a versatile tool. Generally, light fields carry energy and momentum (both linear and angular). Due to the transfer of linear momentum from light to matter, the radiation pressure is exerted, whereas, the intrinsic spin angular momentum (SAM) is associated with the polarization states of light. Light fields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as optical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field of optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction process across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by the presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found a myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation to microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among others. Here, we revisit some of the fundamental concepts on optical vortices and discuss extensively on how this new dimension of light i.e., the OAM, has been exploited in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. We discuss the different types of vortex beams, the techniques used to generate and detect their OAM, and their propagation. Particularly, we put a special emphasis on the utilization of vortex beams in nonlinear regimes to explain different optical phenomena such as the second harmonic generation, parametric down-conversion, and high-order harmonic generation. The generation of vortex beams in the UV to XUV regimes, encoded with higher OAM values, could potentially extend their application range to areas such as high-capacity data transmission, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, phase-contrast imaging, and particle trapping in optical tweezers, among others.</description>

      <title>Quantum dot thermal machines -- a guide to engineering</title>

Abstract: Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached. However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine, such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate transmission level.</description>

      <title>High-Speed NV Ensemble Magnetic Field Imaging via Laser Raster Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a technique that uses an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to image magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization -- analogous to pulsed ODMR -- while the microwave field continuously drives the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microwire with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and, with our diamond, achieves $\text{nT}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$-level per-pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass in Interacting Elko and Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</description>
