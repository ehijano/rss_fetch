      <title>On probabilistic identities and coset identities in pro-$p$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a probabilistic identity on a $\sigma$-compact $K$-analytic group $G$, $K$ a non-archimedean local field, is a coset identity. As an application, one concludes that compact groups which are linear over a local field and various pro-$p$ groups obtained from free constructions satisfy a probabilistic Tits alternative. By means of Lie-theoretic methods, we also study torsion probabilistic identities in virtually free pro-$p$ and compact $p$-adic analytic groups.</description>

      <title>On Similarity Structure Groups and their W$^*$ and C$^*$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite Similarity Structure (FSS) groups are a class of generalized Thompson groups first introduced by Farley and Hughes. In this paper, we study the properties of a new subclass of the more general Countable Similarity Structure (CSS) groups, which we call CSS$^*$ groups. The Higman-Thompson groups $V_{d,r}$, the countable R\"over-Nekrashevych groups $V_d(G)$, and the topological full groups of irreducible one-sided subshifts of finite type studied by Matui are all examples of CSS$^*$ groups. One overarching theme is to isolate a class of CSS groups with the necessary properties to generalize the main result of arXiv:2312.08345 -- primeness of the group von Neumann algebra of $V_d$. We achieve this aim for CSS$^*$ groups and in the process prove that CSS$^*$ groups are non-inner amenable and many are properly proximal, which are new results for $V_{d,r}$, $V_d(G)$, and the groups studied by Matui. A second theme is to produce a dichotomy within CSS$^*$ groups; those that are $C^*$-simple and possess a simple commutator subgroup, and those lacking both properties. In particular, we extend the $C^*$-simplicity results of $V$ and $V(G)$ of arXiv:1605.01651, recover the simple commutator subgroup results of arXiv:2008.04791 and arXiv:1210.5800, and give examples that lack both properties. Lastly, we observe that CSS$^*$ groups are not acylindrically hyperbolic, motivating the need to prove many of these results by other methods.</description>

      <title>Order of dynamical and control systems on maximal compact subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the dynamical orders of minimal Morse components and, partially, of control sets on maximal compact subgroups of a semisimple Lie group as an algebraic order similar to the Bruhat order of the Weyl group. We call this order the extended Bruhat order of the extended Weyl group (or Weyl-Tits group), since it projects onto the Bruhat order and is obtained in an analogous way as the Bruhat order was historically obtained, as the incidence order of the Schubert cells in the maximal flag manifold, but now the Schubert cells in the maximal extended flag manifold.</description>

      <title>Magma-valued metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the second section, we introduce dense unital magmas and show that a near-ring is dense if and only if it has a positive element smaller that unity. In the third section, we discuss magma-valued metric spaces. The density property of the ordered unital magmas and monoids helps us to generalize a couple of classical results related to the convergence and Cauchy property of sequences. The last section is devoted to magma-valued normed groups and some subgroups of the additive group of Cauchy sequences.</description>

      <title>Linear maps preserving product of involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An element of the algebra $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ of $n \times n$ matrices over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is called an involution if its square equals the identity matrix. Gustafson, Halmos, and Radjavi proved that any product of involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ can be expressed as a product of at most four involutions. In this article, we investigate the bijective linear preservers of the sets of products of two, three, or four involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$.</description>

      <title>Forbidden configurations for coherency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Right (and left) coherency and right (and left) weak coherency are natural finitary conditions for monoids. Determining whether or not a given monoid has any of these properties is historically a difficult problem.
  This paper has several aims, centering around the well-studied class of right (and dually left) $E$-Ehresmann monoids, being one of the broadest classes of monoids containing a semilattice of idempotents. First, we exhibit a particular configuration of elements in a monoid subsemigroup of a right (respectively, left) $E$-Ehresmann monoid, relative to the Ehresmann structure of the overmonoid, that prohibits left (respectively, right) coherence. Second, we apply this technique in a number of different situations. We show that the free Ehresmann monoid of rank at least $2$ is neither left nor right coherent, and that the free left Ehresmann monoid is not left coherent. We demonstrate the utility of our technique in the case where the overmonoid is an $E$-unitary inverse monoid, and apply this to both new situations and to recover the existing results. Namely, free inverse monoids and free ample monoids of rank at least 2 are neither left nor right coherent, and free left ample monoids of rank at least $2$ is are not left coherent. Next, in a positive direction, we demonstrate that every free left Ehresmann monoid is weakly coherent.
  Our final result is of a different nature. Ehresmann monoids form a variety of monoids with an enriched signature. Viewed as a bi-unary monoid (respectively, unary monoid), a free Ehresmann monoid (respectively, free left Ehresmann monoid) does not embed into an inverse monoid. We show that viewed as a monoid (the standpoint of this paper) every free Ehresmann monoid (and hence also every free left Ehresmann monoid) embeds into an $E$-unitary inverse monoid.</description>
