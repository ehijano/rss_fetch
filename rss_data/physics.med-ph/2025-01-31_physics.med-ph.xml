      <title>Discrete Dielectric Coatings for Length Control and Tunability of Half-Wave Dipole Antennas at 300 MHz Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel discretely dielectric material-coated (DDMC) dipole antenna design for ultra-high-field (UHF) MRI applications. This design improves frequency tuning, lowers electric field intensity, and reduces SAR by including discrete high-permittivity dielectric coatings at both ends of the dipole. The DDMC dipole's performance was compared to that of a fractionated dipole design using metrics such as inter-element coupling, B1 field distribution, and SNR. Simulations and experimental results showed that the DDMC dipole provided superior B1 field uniformity with significantly reduced B1 variation along the dipole conductor while reducing SAR, making it a safer and more efficient option for MR signal excitation and reception in UHF MR imaging. Furthermore, with its improved electromagnetic decoupling performance, the multichannel array made from the proposed DDMC dipoles shows promise for improving parallel imaging and imaging quality in UHF MRI, with future work focusing on material optimization and scalability for multi-channel arrays.</description>

      <title>Volumetric modulated arc therapy or step-shoot IMRT? A 4D dosimetry study of motion effect in lung SBRT using a dynamic virtual patient model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the impact of delivery techniques and planning parameters on interplay effect in lung SBRT.
  Methods: A dynamic virtual patient model containing normal structures and a tumor with adjustable sizes, locations, and 3D breathing motion was utilized. SBRT plans were developed using both step-and-shoot IMRT and VMAT with different planning parameters (energy, isocenter location, PTV margin, and PTV dose heterogeneity). 4D doses were calculated by simulating synchronized delivery of SBRT to the virtual patient model with random initial positions of tumor motion. The expected dose (average) and the standard deviation of the 4D doses were obtained. The relative difference between the expected GTV minimal/mean (GTVMin/GTVMean) dose and the planned ITVMin/ITVMean dose (denoted by %E/P), and between the GTVMin and the prescription dose (DRx) were computed.
  Results: The %E/P for GTVMean was significantly lower for IMRT than VMAT (0.5% +/- 7.7% v.s. 3.5% +/- 5.0%, p=0.04). The expected GTVMin was lower than DRx in 9.4% of all IMRT plans versus 3.1% in VMAT. The worst-case scenario, 4D GTVMin was 14.1% lower than the ITVMin. Choices of PTV margin or dose heterogeneity to be achieved in PTV can result in significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in motion interplay depending on delivery techniques.
  Conclusion: Motion interplay may cause the expected GTVMin to be less than the planned ITV minimal dose and DRx for both IMRT and VMAT plans. The differences between the expected GTV dose and the ITV dose depended on the delivery technique and planning parameters. Overall, VMAT is less prone to motion interplay than IMRT.</description>

      <title>Scattering approach to diffusion quantifies axonal damage in brain injury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early diagnosis and noninvasive monitoring of neurological disorders require sensitivity to elusive cellular-level alterations that occur much earlier than volumetric changes observable with the millimeter-resolution of medical imaging modalities. Morphological changes in axons, such as axonal varicosities or beadings, are observed in neurological disorders, as well as in development and aging. Here, we reveal the sensitivity of time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) to axonal morphology at the micrometer scale. Scattering theory uncovers the two parameters that determine the diffusive dynamics of water in axons: the average reciprocal cross-section and the variance of long-range cross-sectional fluctuations. This theoretical development allowed us to predict dMRI metrics sensitive to axonal alterations across tens of thousands of axons in seconds rather than months of simulations in a rat model of traumatic brain injury. Our approach bridges the gap between micrometers and millimeters in resolution, offering quantitative, objective biomarkers applicable to a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>Waveform-Specific Performance of Deep Learning-Based Super-Resolution for Ultrasound Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving arterial flows is essential for understanding cardiovascular pathologies, improving diagnosis, and monitoring patient condition. Ultrasound contrast imaging uses microbubbles to enhance the scattering of the blood pool, allowing for real-time visualization of blood flow. Recent developments in vector flow imaging further expand the imaging capabilities of ultrasound by temporally resolving fast arterial flow. The next obstacle to overcome is the lack of spatial resolution. Super-resolved ultrasound images can be obtained by deconvolving radiofrequency (RF) signals before beamforming, breaking the link between resolution and pulse duration. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained to locally estimate the deconvolution kernel and consequently super-localize the microbubbles directly within the RF signal. However, microbubble contrast is highly nonlinear, and the potential of CNNs in microbubble localization has not yet been fully exploited. Assessing deep learning-based deconvolution performance for non-trivial imaging pulses is therefore essential for successful translation to a practical setting, where the signal-to-noise ratio is limited, and transmission schemes should comply with safety guidelines. In this study, we train CNNs to deconvolve RF signals and localize the microbubbles driven by harmonic pulses, chirps, or delay-encoded pulse trains. Furthermore, we discuss potential hurdles for in-vitro and in-vivo super-resolution by presenting preliminary experimental results. We find that, whereas the CNNs can accurately localize microbubbles for all pulses, a short imaging pulse offers the best performance in noise-free conditions. However, chirps offer a comparable performance without noise, but are more robust to noise and outperform all other pulses in low-signal-to-noise ratio conditions.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Dosimetric Study of Proton and Photon Therapy in Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radioablation for Ventricular Tachycardia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: VT is a life-threatening arrhythmia commonly treated with catheter ablation; however, some cases remain refractory to conventional treatment. STAR has emerged as a non-invasive option for such patients. While photon-based STAR has shown efficacy, proton therapy offers potential advantages due to its superior dose conformity and sparing of critical OARs, including the heart itself. This study aims to investigate and compare the dosimetry between proton and photon therapy for VT, focusing on target coverage and OAR sparing. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 34 VT patients who received photon STAR. Proton STAR plans were generated using robust optimization in RayStation to deliver the same prescription dose of 25 Gy in a single fraction while minimizing dose to OARs. Dosimetric metrics, including D99, D95, Dmean, and D0.03cc, were extracted for critical OARs and VAS. Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to assess normality, followed by paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for statistical comparisons between modalities, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons. Results: Proton and photon plans achieved comparable target coverage, with VAS D95 of 24.1 +/- 1.2 Gy vs. 24.7 +/- 1.0 Gy (p=0.294). Proton therapy significantly reduced OAR doses, including heart Dmean (3.6 +/- 1.5 Gy vs. 5.5 +/- 2.0 Gy, p&lt;0.001), lungs Dmean (1.6 +/- 1.5 Gy vs. 2.1 +/- 1.4 Gy, p&lt;0.001), and esophagus Dmean (0.3 +/- 0.6 Gy vs. 1.6 +/- 1.3 Gy, p&lt;0.001), while maintaining optimal target coverage. Conclusion: Proton therapy for STAR demonstrates significant dosimetric advantages in sparing the heart and other critical OARs compared to photon therapy for VT, while maintaining equivalent target coverage. These findings highlight the potential of proton therapy to reduce treatment-related toxicity and improve outcomes for VT patients.</description>

      <title>High-resolution deuterium metabolic imaging of the human brain at 9.4 T using bSSFP spectral-spatial acquisitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated the feasibility of using bSSFP acquisitions for off-resonance insensitive high-resolution [6,6'-2H2]-glucose deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) studies in the healthy human brain at 9.4T. Balanced SSFP acquisitions have potential to improve the sensitivity of DMI despite the SNR loss of phase-cycling and other human scanner constraints.We investigated two variants of bSSFP acquisitions, namely uniform-weighted multi echo and acquisition-weighted CSI to improve the SNR of deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) in the brain with oral labelled-glucose intake. Phase-cycling was introduced to make bSSFP acquisitions less sensitive to B0 inhomogeneity. Two SNR optimal methods for obtaining metabolite amplitudes from the phase-cycled data were proposed. The SNR performance of the two bSSFP variants was compared with a standard gradient-spoiled CSI acquisition and subsequent IDEAL processing. In addition, in vivo T1 and T2 of water, glucose and Glx (glutamate+glutamine) were estimated from non-localized inversion recovery and spin-echo measurements.High-resolution whole-brain dynamic quantitative DMI maps were successfully obtained for all three acquisitions. Phase-cycling improved the quality of bSSFP metabolite estimation and provided additional spectral encoding. The SNR improvement was only observed for the CSI variant of bSSFP acquisitions with an average increase of 18% and 27% for glucose and Glx, respectively, compared to the vendor's CSI. ME-bSSFP acquisition achieved higher resolutions than acquisition-weighted CSI and exhibited several qualitative improvements.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Organ Movements Using Automatic Region Segmentation of Swallowing CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first report on the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) for automatic region segmentation of four-dimensional computer tomography (4D-CT) images during swallowing. The material consists of 4D-CT images taken during swallowing. Additionally, data for verifying the practicality of the AI were obtained from 4D-CT images during mastication and swallowing. The ground truth data for the region segmentation for the AI were created from five 4D-CT datasets of swallowing. A 3D convolutional model of nnU-Net was used for the AI. The learning and evaluation method for the AI was leave-one-out cross-validation. The number of epochs for training the nnU-Net was 100. The Dice coefficient was used as a metric to assess the AI's region segmentation accuracy. Regions with a median Dice coefficient of 0.7 or higher included the bolus, bones, tongue, and soft palate. Regions with a Dice coefficient below 0.7 included the thyroid cartilage and epiglottis. Factors that reduced the Dice coefficient included metal artifacts caused by dental crowns in the bolus and the speed of movement for the thyroid cartilage and epiglottis. In practical verification of the AI, no significant misrecognition was observed for facial bones, jaw bones, or the tongue. However, regions such as the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and epiglottis were not fully delineated during fast movement. It is expected that future research will improve the accuracy of the AI's region segmentation, though the risk of misrecognition will always exist. Therefore, the development of tools for efficiently correcting the AI's segmentation results is necessary. AI-based visualization is expected to contribute not only to the deepening of motion analysis of organs during swallowing but also to improving the accuracy of swallowing CT by clearly showing the current state of its precision.</description>
