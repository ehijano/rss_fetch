      <title>Pairing susceptibility in the multi-layer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the interaction, doping, and layer dependence of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing susceptibility of the Hubbard model for a stacked 2D square lattice. We perform a multi-index perturbative expansion up to fourth-order to obtain coefficients in powers of the Hubbard $U$, the inter-layer $V$, and the pair-hopping $J$ interactions. We evaluate the vertex diagrams that contribute to the pairing susceptibility for $\ell= 2,3, 4$ layered models in the U-V-J interaction space. This provides unprecedented access to the pairing amplitudes, allowing us to identify the processes that enhance or reduce pairing. We distinguish pairing within the diagonal channel, $P^{\parallel}_{d}$, and off-diagonal channel, $P^{\perp}_{d}$, and find that, in the absence of $J$, the qualitative behavior of the layered system is equivalent to the single-layer model. In the presence of $J$, we show that pairing is enhanced sublinearly with increasing $\ell$ and is primarily mediated by the $P^{\perp}_{d}$ component and find which coefficients and diagram sets are responsible. Finally, we construct a generalized $\ell$-dependent equation for the d-wave pair susceptibility to speculate pairing beyond $\ell=4$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Critical Current Density in Thin Superconductor Layers by Moir\'e Pinning Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One important factor affecting the critical current density in type-II superconductors is the formation of artificial pinning centers. Hence, the engineering of pinning centers in superconducting systems has garnered considerable attention. In this study, the effect of moir\'e patterned pinning centers on the critical current density of superconducting tapes is investigated. The Langevin equation is solved by taking into account the prominent forces within the superconductor medium, using the appropriate boundary conditions for vortices. The vortices dynamics are investigated by performing molecular dynamics simulations, which are used to calculate the corresponding critical current densities. Results show a significant enhancement in the critical current density at particular angles of the relative rotation of the primary lattices. It is also revealed that for stronger pinning forces, the calculated critical current densities are higher in the moir\'e lattices compared to the primary lattices of pinning centers.</description>

      <title>Shaping the topology of twisted bilayer graphene via time-reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking is an effective tool for tuning the transport and topological properties of 2D layered materials. Among these materials, twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has emerged as a promising platform for new physics, characterized by a rich interplay between topological features and strongly correlated electronic behavior. In this study, we utilize time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) to manipulate the topological properties of TBG. By varying the strength of TRSB, we discover a topological phase transition between a topological insulating phase, which exhibits a pair of flat bands with opposite Chern numbers, and a novel insulating state where the Chern number, but not the Berry curvature, of the flat bands vanishes. We demonstrate that this topological transition is mediated by a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, and we construct a three-dimensional phase diagram as a function of the twisting angle, the symmetry-breaking parameter, and the mismatch coupling between AA and AB stacking regions. Finally, we show that this novel electronic phase can be identified in the lab by measuring, as a function of the Fermi energy, its non-quantized anomalous Hall conductivity that is induced by the Berry dipole density of the lowest flat bands.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer and twisted trilayer graphene has generated tremendous interest. The key feature of these systems is an interplay between interlayer coupling and a moir\'e superlattice that gives rise to low-energy flat bands with strong correlations. Flat bands can also be induced by moir\'e patterns in lattice-mismatched and or twisted heterostructures of other two-dimensional materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Although a wide range of correlated phenomenon have indeed been observed in the moir\'e TMDs, robust demonstration of superconductivity has remained absent. Here we report superconductivity in 5 degree twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) with a maximum critical temperature of 426 mK. The superconducting state appears in a limited region of displacement field and density that is adjacent to a metallic state with Fermi surface reconstruction believed to arise from antiferromagnetic order. A sharp boundary is observed between the superconducting and magnetic phases at low temperature, reminiscent of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity. Our results establish that moir\'e flat-band superconductivity extends beyond graphene structures. Material properties that are absent in graphene but intrinsic among the TMDs such as a native band gap, large spin-orbit coupling, spin-valley locking, and magnetism offer the possibility to access a broader superconducting parameter space than graphene-only structures.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Anomalous Metal States in Iron-Based Interface Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.15488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the anomalous metal state has been a major puzzle in condensed matter physics for more than three decades. Here, we report systematic investigation and modulation of the anomalous metal states in high-temperature interface superconductor FeSe films on SrTiO3 substrate. Remarkably, under zero magnetic field, the anomalous metal state persists up to 20 K in pristine FeSe films, an exceptionally high temperature standing out from previous observations. In stark contrast, for the FeSe films with nano-hole arrays, the characteristic temperature of the anomalous metal state is considerably reduced. We demonstrate that the observed anomalous metal states originate from the quantum tunneling of vortices adjusted by the Ohmic dissipation. Our work offers a perspective for understanding the origin and modulation of the anomalous metal states in two-dimensional bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Post-experiment coincidence counting method for coincidence detection techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, two coincidence detection techniques, the coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and the coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS), have been proposed to detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. In the original proposals, a coincidence detector is introduced for the coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes. In this article, we present a {\it post-experiment} coincidence counting method for the proposed coincidence detection techniques without a coincidence detector. It requires a {\it pulse} photon or neutron source. Consider one incident multiphoton or multineutron pulse that causes many photoelectric or neutron-scattering processes within one time window. $I_{d_1}^{(1)}$ and $I_{d_2}^{(1)}$ record the numbers of the emitted photoelectrons or the scattered neutrons which arrive at two detectors $D_1$ and $D_2$, respectively. The coincidence counting is defined by $I_d^{(2)}=I_{d_1}^{(1)} \times I_{d_2}^{(1)}$, which records the coincidence probability of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes within this time window. Therefore, $I_d^{(2)}$ involves the two-body correlations of the target electrons. The previously proposed cARPES and cINS can be implemented upon the {\it pulse}-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatuses with pulse sources.</description>

      <title>Spin Signature of Majorana Fermions in Topological Nodal-Point Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional topological nodal superconductors, Majorana edge states have been conventionally believed to exhibit only spin-triplet pairing correlations. However, we reveal a substantial spin-singlet pairing component in Majorana edge states of antiferromagnetic topological nodal-point superconductors. This unexpected phenomenon emerges from the interplay between antiferromagnetic order and symmetry, resulting in Majorana edge states with a nearly flat band dispersion, deviating from the strictly flat band. Crucially, this phenomenon is detectable through spin-selective Andreev reflection, where the zero-bias conductance peaks are maximized when the spin of incident electrons is nearly antiparallel to that of Majorana edge excitations. This discovery unveils a unique spin signature for Andreev reflection resonances, advancing our fundamental understanding of spin-dependent mechanisms in topological superconductivity and representing a significant step towards the experimental detection of Majorana fermions.</description>

      <title>Cuprate-like Electronic Structures in Infinite-Layer Nickelates with Substantial Hole Dopings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting infinite-layer (IL) nickelates offer a new platform for investigating the long-standing problem of high-temperature superconductivity. Many models were proposed to understand its superconducting mechanisms based on the calculated electronic structure, and the multiple Fermi surfaces and multiple orbitals involved create complications and controversial conclusions. Over the past 5 years, the lack of direct measurements of the electronic structure has hindered the understanding of nickelate superconductors. Here we fill this gap by directly resolving the electronic structures of the parent compound LaNiO$_2$ and superconducting La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that their Fermi surfaces consist of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) hole pocket and a three-dimensional (3D) electron pocket at the Brillouin zone corner, whose volumes change upon Ca doping. The Fermi surface topology and band dispersion of the hole pocket closely resemble those observed in hole-doped cuprates. However, the cuprate-like band exhibits significantly higher hole doping in superconducting La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ compared to superconducting cuprates, highlighting the disparities in the electronic states of the superconducting phase. Our observations highlight the novel aspects of the IL nickelates, and pave the way toward the microscopic understanding of the IL nickelate family and its superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Pb Substitution Effects on Lattice and Electronic System of the BiS2-based Superconductors La(O F)BiS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examined the effect of Pb substitution in the layered superconductor LaO0.5F0.5Bi1-xPbxS2 (x=0~0.15) through the measurements of the resistivity, thermal expansion, specific heat, and Seebeck coefficient. These transport and thermal properties show anomalies at certain temperatures (T*) for x${\geq}$0.08. The large thermal expansion anomalies, specific heat anomalies, and the existence of hystereses in the above measurements indicate a first-order structural phase transition at T*. Additionally, the Seebeck coefficient indicates that the anomalies at T* are related not only to the lattice system, but also to the electronic system. Superconductivity is not observed above 2 K at x=0.08, which is around the phase boundary where T* vanishes. The suppression of superconductivity around the structural phase boundary suggests a close relationship between the lattice and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Finite-frequency normal and superfluid drag effects in two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-component systems consisting of mutually interacting particles can demonstrate both intracomponent transport effects and intercomponent entrainment (or drag) effects. In the presence of superfluidity, the intracomponent transport is characterized by dissipative conductivity and superfluid weight in the framework of two-fluid model, and intercomponent entrainment gives rise to normal and nondissipative drag effects. We present unified treatment of all these effects for spatially homogeneous two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates based on the Bogoliubov theory, focusing specifically on the drag effects. Calculating finite-frequency intra- and intercomponent conductivities with taking into account quasiparticle damping, we derive and numerically check analytical Drude-like approximations applicable at low frequencies, and Lorentz-like approximations applicable at higher frequencies in vicinity of the resonant energy of spin-to-density Bogoliubov quasiparticle conversion. As possible physical realizations of two-component atomic systems, we consider three-dimensional Bose-Bose mixtures and closely spaced two-layered systems of magnetic dipolar atoms.</description>

      <title>Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers with intrinsic separation of pump and signal tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers achieve ultra-low-noise amplification through the nonlinear kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. One of the main challenges to the operation of these devices is the separation of the strong pump tone from the signal tone after amplification has been achieved. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a pump separation method based on operating a half-wave superconducting resonator amplifier behind a cryogenic circulator. Our pump separation scheme does not involve post-amplification interference, and thereby avoids the delicate phase matching of two different pump paths. We demonstrate the scheme using two-port half-wave resonator amplifiers based on superconducting NbN thin-films. We present measurements of gain profiles and degrees of pump separation for amplifiers having different coupling quality factors. On an amplifier having a coupling quality factor of $\sim2000$, we measured a peak signal gain of $15\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst achieving pump separation of $12\,\mathrm{dB}$. The amplifier was stable for continuous measurements, and the gain drift was measured to be $0.15\,\mathrm{dB}$ over an hour. The same amplifier was operated at $3.2\,\mathrm{K}$ and achieved a peak signal gain of $11\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst having a pump separation factor of $10.5\,\mathrm{dB}$. The pump separation scheme, and these promising results, will advance the development of superconducting resonator amplifiers as an important technology in quantum sensing.</description>
