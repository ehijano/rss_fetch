      <title>Semisimplicity of conformal blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that braid group representations associated to braided fusion categories and mapping class group representations associated to modular fusion categories are always semisimple. The proof relies on the theory of extensions in non-Abelian Hodge theory and on Ocneanu rigidity. By combining this with previous results on the existence of variations in Hodge structures, we further show that such a braid group or mapping class group representation preserves a non-degenerate Hermitian form and can be defined over some CM number field.</description>

      <title>The trigonal construction and the second moment of the tropical Prym variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the tropical trigonal construction to calculate the second moment of the tropical Prym variety of all double covers $\pi:\widetilde{\Gamma}\to \Gamma$ of tropical curves of genus $g(\Gamma)\leq 4$. The answer is expressed in terms of the signed graphic matroid of the double cover and consists a polynomial and piecewise-polynomial term. We relate the latter term, which does not occur in the analogous formula for the tropical Jacobian, to the problem of extending the Prym--Torelli map from the moduli space of admissible double covers to the second Voronoi compactification of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Mixed Segre zeta functions and their log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the mixed Segre zeta function of a sequence of homogeneous ideals in a polynomial ring. This function is a power series encoding information about the mixed Segre classes obtained by extending the ideals to projective spaces of arbitrarily large dimension. Our work generalizes and unifies results by Kleiman and Thorup on mixed Segre classes and by Aluffi on Segre zeta functions. We prove that this power series is rational, with poles corresponding to the degrees of the generators of the ideals. We also show that the mixed Segre zeta function only depends on the integral closure of the ideals. Finally, we prove that the homogenization of the numerator of a modification of the mixed Segre zeta function is denormalized Lorentzian in the sense of Br\"and\'en and Huh.</description>

      <title>Singular varieties and infinitesimal non-commutative Witt vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a projective variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, M. V. Nori introduced in 1976 a group scheme $\pi(X)$ which accounts for principal bundles $P\to X$ with finite structure, obtaining in this way an amplification the etale fundamental group. One drawback of this theory is that it is quite difficult to arrive at an explicit description of $\pi(X)$, whenever it does not vanish altogether. To wit, there are no known non-trivial examples in the literature where $\pi(X)$ is local, or local of some given height, etc. In this paper we obtain a description of $\pi(X)$ through amalgamated products of certain non-commutative local group schemes - we called them infinitesimal non-commutative Witt group schemes - in the case where $X$ is a non-normal variety obtained by pinching a simply connected one.</description>

      <title>Some general \'etale Weak Lefschetz-type theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new general etale versions of theorems of Barth and Sommese. Respectively, we compute the lower etale cohomology of closed subvarieties of $P^N$ of small codimensions and of their preimages with respect to proper morphisms (that are not necessarily finite; this statement is completely new), and also of the zero loci of sections of ample vector bundles; all these statements are valid over fields of arbitrary characteristics. To obtain these results, we use a new 'fat hyperplane section' Weak Lefschetz-type theorem for etale cohomology of non-projective varieties that is related to a result of Goresky and MacPherson (over complex numbers).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we redefine the theory of walls and chambers due to Qin developing a new tool to study moduli spaces of stable rank 2 vector bundles on algebraic varieties of higher dimension. We apply it to describe components of some moduli spaces of rank 2 stable bundles on ruled 3-folds as well as to prove that some Brill-Noether loci are non-empty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vl{\u a}du{\c t} characterized in 1999 the set of finite fields $k$ such that all elliptic curves defined over $k$ have a cyclic group of rational points. Under the conjecture of infinitely many Mersenne primes, this set is infinite. In these notes we prove that there is no a finite field $k$ such that all the simple abelian varieties defined over $k$ of dimension $g&gt;1$ have a cyclic group of rational points.</description>

      <title>Tschirnhausen Bundles of Quintic Covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A degree $d$ genus $g$ cover of the complex projective line by a smooth irreducible curve $C$ yields a vector bundle on the projective line by pushforward of the structure sheaf. We classify the bundles that arise this way when $d = 5$. Equivalently, we classify which $\mathbb{P}^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$ contain smooth irreducible degree $5$ covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$. Our main contribution is proving the existence of smooth covers whose structure sheaf has the desired pushforward. We do this by showing that the substack of singular curves has positive codimension in the moduli stack of finite flat covers with desired pushforward. To compute the dimension of the space of singular curves, we prove a (relative) ``minimization theorem'', which is the geometric analogue of Bhargava's sieving argument when computing the densities of discriminants of quintic number fields.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal Torelli problems for special Gushel-Mukai and related Fano threefolds: Hodge theoretical and categorical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate infinitesimal Torelli problems for some of the Fano threefolds of the following two types: (a) those which can be described as zero loci of sections of vector bundles on Grassmannians (for instance, ordinary Gushel-Mukai threefolds), and (b) double covers of rigid Fano threefolds branched along a $K3$ surface (such as, special Gushel-Mukai threefolds). The differential of the period map for ordinary Gushel-Mukai threefolds has been studied by Debarre, Iliev and Manivel; in particular, it has a $2$-dimensional kernel. The main result of this paper is that the invariant part of the infinitesimal period map for a special Gushel-Mukai threefold is injective. We prove this result using a Hodge theoretical argument as well as a categorical method. Through similar approaches, we also study infinitesimal Torelli problems for prime Fano threefolds with genus $7$, $8$, $9$, $10$, $12$ (type (a)) and for special Verra threefolds (type (b)). Furthermore, a geometric description of the kernel of the differential of the period maps for Gushel-Mukai threefolds (and for prime Fano threefolds of genus $8$) is given via a Bridgeland moduli space in the Kuznetsov components.</description>

      <title>Monodromy Representations: Decomposing Rank-Three Bundles over the Projective Line with Three Marked Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a monodromy representation $\rho$ of the projective line minus $m$ points, one can extend the resulting vector bundle with connection map canonically to a vector bundle with logarithmic connection map over all of the projective line. Now, since vector bundles split as twisting sheaves over the projective line, the focus of this work regards knowing the exact decomposition; i.e., computing the roots. Particularly, we use the monodromy derivative to compute the roots for all three-dimensional $\rho$ when $m = 3$.</description>

      <title>Explicit Bounds on the Spectrum of 6d N=(1,0) Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to derive explicit and uniform upper bounds on the particle spectrum of six-dimensional gravitational theories with minimal supersymmetry, focusing initially on the tensor sector. The strategy is motivated by considerations of F-theory compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau 3-folds. However, it admits a clear bottom-up interpretation and is thus applicable to general supergravity theories modulo certain physical conjectures. At the heart of the strategy are two key structures, most natural in birational geometry: one concerns the singularity of the natural pairs on the base manifolds, and the other, the fibration generically exhibited by the bases. Put physically, the former structure keeps the effective theories from decompactifying and the latter ensures the (generic) presence of a heterotic string. We sketch our bounding strategy and present, for an illustration, the explicit bounds thereby derived on the tensor spectrum, with the technical details relegated to a companion paper [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute an explicit rank bound on the Picard group of the compact surfaces, which can serve as the base of an elliptic Calabi-Yau variety with canonical singularities. To bound the Picard rank from above, we develop a novel strategy in birational geometry, motivated in part by the physics of six-dimensional vacua of F-theory as discussed in a companion paper [1] to this one. The derivation of the concrete bound illustrates the strategy and clarifies the origin of the boundedness.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian Geometry associated to Gradient Flows of Linear Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study geometric properties of the gradient flow for learning deep linear convolutional networks. For linear fully connected networks, it has been shown recently that the corresponding gradient flow on parameter space can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space (i.e., on the product of weight matrices) if the initialization satisfies a so-called balancedness condition. We establish that the gradient flow on parameter space for learning linear convolutional networks can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space regardless of the initialization. This result holds for $D$-dimensional convolutions with $D \geq 2$, and for $D =1$ it holds if all so-called strides of the convolutions are greater than one. The corresponding Riemannian metric depends on the initialization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following earlier work by Coons-Maraj-Misra-Sorea and Misra-Sullivant, we study colored, undirected Gaussian graphical models, and present a necessary and sufficient condition for such a model to have binomial vanishing ideal. These conditions involve Jordan schemes, a variant of association schemes, well-known structures in algebraic combinatorics. Using association schemes without transitive group action, we refute the conjecture by Coons-Maraj-Misra-Sorea that binomiality implies that the color classes must be orbits under the automorphism group of the colored graph.</description>

      <title>Counting isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the precise number of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with $\text{char}(\mathbb{F}_q) = 3,2$. The key idea is to obtain the exact unweighted number of rational points on the classifying stacks $\mathcal{B} Q_{12}$, $\mathcal{B} Q_{24}$ and $\mathcal{B} Z$, where $Q_{12}$ and $Q_{24}$ denote the dicyclic groups of orders 12 and 24, respectively, and $Z$ denotes the non-reduced group scheme of order 2. This computation, inspired by the classical work of [de Jong] and performed via motivic height zeta functions of height moduli spaces constructed in [Bejleri-Park-Satriano], establishes a complete determination of the total number of isomorphism classes of rational points on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}$ over any rational function field $k(t)$ with perfect residue field $\text{char}(k) \ge 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f(x) = x^{2g+1} + c_1 x^{2g} + \dots + c_{2g+1} \in k[x]$ be a polynomial of nonzero discriminant, and let $J$ denote the Jacobian of the odd hyperelliptic curve $C : y^2 = f(x)$. We show that the morphism $J \to \mathbb{P}^{2^g-1}$ associated to the linear system $|2 \Theta|$ may be described explicitly, for any $g \geq 1$, using the theory of pure spinors.
  We apply this theory to study the heights of rational points in $J(k)$, when $k$ is a number field. As a particular consequence, we show that $100\%$ of monic, degree $2g+1$ polynomials $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of nonzero discriminant $\Delta(f)$ have the property that, for any non-trivial point $P \in J(\mathbb{Q})$, the canonical height of $P$ satisfies $ \widehat{h}_\Theta(P) \geq \left(\frac{3g-1}{4g(2g+1)} - \epsilon\right) \log | \Delta(f) |$. This is a `density 1' form of the Lang--Silverman conjecture.</description>

      <title>On Shilov boundaries, Rees valuations and integral extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an analogy between, on one hand, the notions of integral closure of ideals and Rees valuations in commutative algebra and, on the other hand, the notions of spectral seminorm and Shilov boundary in nonarchimedean geometry. For any Tate ring $\mathcal{A}$ with a Noetherian ring of definition $\mathcal{A}_{0}$ and pseudo-uniformizer $\varpi\in\mathcal{A}_{0}$, we prove that the Shilov boundary for $\mathcal{A}$ naturally coincides with the set of Rees valuation rings of the principal ideal $(\varpi)_{\mathcal{A}_{0}}$ of $\mathcal{A}_{0}$.
  Furthermore, we characterize the Shilov boundary for a wide class of Tate rings by means of minimal open prime ideals in the subring of power-bounded elements. For affinoid algebras, in the sense of Tate, whose underlying rings are integral domains, this recovers a well-known result of Berkovich. Moreover, under some mild assumptions, we prove stability of our characterization of the Shilov boundary under (completed) integral extensions. In particular, for every mixed-characteristic Noetherian domain $R$, we obtain a description of the Shilov boundary for the Tate ring $\widehat{R^{+}}[p^{-1}]$, where $\widehat{R^{+}}$ is the $p$-adic completion of the absolute integral closure of the domain $R$.</description>

      <title>On the singular loci of higher secant varieties of Veronese embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-th secant variety of a projective variety $X \subset \mathbb{P}^N$, denoted by $\sigma_k(X)$, is defined to be the closure of the union of $(k-1)$-planes spanned by $k$ points on $X$. In this paper, we examine the $k$-th secant variety $\sigma_k(v_d(\mathbb{P}^n)) \subset \mathbb{P}^N$ of the image of the $d$-uple Veronese embedding $v_d$ of $\mathbb{P}^n$ to $\mathbb{P}^N$ with $N=\binom{n+d}{d}-1$, and focus on the singular locus of $\sigma_k(v_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$, which is only known for $k\le3$.
  To study the singularity for arbitrary $k,d,n$, we define \emph{the $m$-subsecant locus} of $\sigma_k(v_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$ to be the union of $\sigma_k(v_d(\mathbb{P}^m))$ with any $m$-plane $\mathbb{P}^m \subset \mathbb{P}^n$. By investigating the projective geometry of moving embedded tangent spaces along subvarieties and using known results on the secant defectivity and the identifiability of symmetric tensors, we determine whether the $m$-subsecant locus is contained in the singular locus of $\sigma_k(v_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$ or not.
  Depending on the value of $k$, these subsecant loci show an interesting trichotomy between generic smoothness, non-trivial singularity, and trivial singularity. In many cases, they can be used as a new source for the singularity of the $k$-th secant variety of $v_d(\mathbb{P}^n)$ other than the trivial one, the $(k-1)$-th secant variety of $v_d(\mathbb{P}^n)$. We also consider the case of the $4$-th secant variety of $v_d(\mathbb{P}^n)$ by applying main results and computing conormal space via a certain type of Young flattening. Finally, we present some generalizations and discussions for further developments.</description>

      <title>Generic root counts and flatness in tropical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use tropical and non-archimedean geometry to study the generic number of solutions of families of polynomial equations over a parameter space $Y$. In particular, we are interested in the choices of parameters for which the generic root count is attained. Our families are given as subschemes $X\subseteq T$ where $T$ is a relative torus over $Y$. We generalize Bernstein's theorem from an intersecting family of hypersurfaces $X=V(f_1)\cap\dots\cap V(f_n)$ to an intersecting family of higher-codimensional schemes $X=X_1\cap\dots\cap X_k$, replacing the mixed volume by a tropical intersection product. Central to our work is the notion of tropical flatness of $X$ around a point $P\in Y$, which allows us to transfer tropical properties of the fiber over $P$ to generic properties. We show that tropical flatness holds over a dense open subset of the Berkovich analytification $Y^\text{an}$, and that the tropical intersection number is attained as a root count at all $P\in Y^\text{an}$ around which the $X_i$'s are tropically flat and the tropical prevariety of the fibers $\bigcap_{i=1}^k\text{Trop}(X_{i,P})$ is bounded. We then study the generic root count of a wide class of parametrized square polynomial systems. This in particular gives tropical formulas for the volumes of Newton-Okounkov bodies, and the number of complex steady states of chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>A Prym-Narasimhan-Ramanan construction of principal bundle fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface and $G$ be a connected reductive complex Lie group with centre $Z$. Consider the moduli space $M(X,G)$ of polystable principal holomorphic $G$-bundles on $X$. There is an action of the group $H^1(X,Z)$ of isomorphism classes of $Z$-bundles over $X$ on $M(X,G)$ induced by the multiplication $Z\times G\to G.$ Let $\Gamma$ be a finite subgroup of $H^1(X,Z)$. Our goal is to find a Prym--Narasimhan--Ramanan-type construction to describe the fixed points of $M(X,G)$ under the action of $\Gamma$. A main ingredient in this construction is the theory of twisted equivariant bundles on an \'etale cover of $X$ developed in arXiv:2208.0902(2).</description>

Abstract: We classify all normal Schubert varieties in the affine Grassmannian of a semisimple group over an arbitrary field with special attention to small positive characteristic. The proof is elementary and relies on tangent space calculations for quasi-minuscule Schubert varieties, a refined Levi lemma in positive characteristic and the classification of minimal degenerations.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be an integral scheme of finite type over a complete DVR of mixed characteristic. We provide a definition of a test ideal which agrees with the multiplier ideal after inverting $p$, is computed from a sufficiently large alteration, agrees with previous mixed characteristic BCM test ideals after completing at any point of residue characteristic $p$ (up to small perturbation), and which satisfies the full suite of expected properties of a multiplier or test ideal. This object is obtained via the $p$-adic Riemann-Hilbert functor.</description>

Abstract: We study the action of the infinite Frobenius on the de Rham fundamental groups of affine curves defined over $\bfR$. As an application, we compute extension classes of real mixed Hodge structures associated with the motivic fundamental groups of affine curves. In the case of modular curves, we relate our computation to special values of Rankin-Selberg L-functions, and show that the associated extensions of mixed Hodge structures are non-split. We compute local zeta integrals both at good primes and, in certain cases, at bad primes.</description>

Abstract: We consider toric maximum likelihood estimation over the field of Puiseux series and study critical points of the likelihood function using tropical methods. This problem translates to finding the intersection points of a tropical affine space with a classical linear subspace. We derive new structural results on tropical affine spaces and use these to give a complete and explicit description of the tropical critical points in certain cases. In these cases, we associate tropical critical points to the simplices in a regular triangulation of the polytope giving rise to the toric model.</description>

Abstract: Let $\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda)}$ be a formal group scheme which deforms $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_a$ to $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_m$. And let $\psi^{(l)}:\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda)}\rightarrow\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda^{p^l})}$ be the $l$-th Frobenius-type homomorphism determined by $\lambda$. We show that the homomorphism $(\psi^{(l)})^\ast:H^2_0(\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda^{p^l})},\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_m)\rightarrow H^2_0(\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda)},\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_m)$ induced by $\psi^{(l)}$ is injective over a $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-algebra under a suitable restriction on $\lambda$. In this situation, the Cartier dual of $\mathrm{Ker}(\psi^{(l)})$, which is a finite group scheme of order $p^l$, is described over a $\mathbb{Z}/(p^n)$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Constant coefficient and intersection complex $L$-classes of projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a projective variety $X$, we have the intersection complex $L$-classes $L_*(X)$ defined by Goresky-MacPerson using cohomotopy and also the constant coefficient $L$-class $L^c_*(X)$ defined by applying an $L$-class transformation (or $T_{1*}$) to a cubic hyperresolution of $X$. These coincide if $X$ is a $\mathbb Q$-homology manifold. We show that the two $L$-classes $L_*(X)$ and $L^c_*(X)$ differ if they do by replacing $X$ with an intersection of general hyperplane sections which has only $\mathbb Q$-homologically isolated singularities. Finding a good sufficient condition for the non-coincidence of $L_*(X)$ and $L^c_*(X)$ is thus reduced to the latter case, where a necessary and sufficient condition has been obtained in terms of the Hodge signatures of stalks of intersection complex in our previous paper. In the case of projective hypersurfaces having only isolated singularities, the difference between $L_*(X)$ and $L^c_*(X)$ is given by the Hodge signatures of the link cohomologies at singular points, and the Hodge signatures of the vanishing cohomologies give the difference between $L^c_*(X)$ and the virtual $L$-class of $X$, that is, the image by a retraction map of the $L$-class of a smooth deformation of $X$ in an ambient smooth projective variety $Y$ in the very ample case.</description>

Abstract: We essentially complete a program initiated by Boyarchenko--Weinstein to give a full description of the cohomology of deep level Deligne--Lusztig varieties for elliptic tori, with coefficients in arbitrary non-defining characteristics. We give several applications of our results: we show that the $\phi$-weight part of the cohomology is very often concentrated in a single degree, and is induced from a Yu-type subgroup. Also, we give applications to a previous work of the second author on decomposition of deep level Deligne--Lusztig representations, and to Feng's explicit construction of Fargues--Scholze parameters. Furthermore, a conjecture of Chan--Oi about the Drinfeld stratification is verified as a special case from our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface, $\Gamma$ a finite group of automorphisms of $X$ and $G$ a connected reductive complex Lie group with center $Z$. If we equip this data with a homomorphism $\theta:\Gamma\to\text{Aut}(G)$ and a 2-cocycle $c:\Gamma\times\Gamma\to Z$, there is a notion of $(\theta,c)$-twisted $\Gamma$-equivariant $G$-bundle over $X$. The aim of this paper is to construct a coarse moduli space of isomorphism classes of polystable $(\theta,c)$-twisted equivariant $G$-bundles over $X$, according to the definition of polystability given by Garc\'ia-Prada--Gothen--Mundet i Riera. This generalizes the well-known construction of the moduli space of $G$-bundles given by Ramanathan. It also gives, in particular, a GIT construction of the moduli space of $\Gamma$-equivariant $G$-bundles, and the moduli space of $\hat G$-bundles for $\hat G$ non-connected by our joint work with Garc\'ia-Prada, Gothen and Mundet i Riera -- complementing the construction of a projective good moduli space for the moduli stack of $\hat G$-bundles given by Olsson--Reppen--Tajakka.</description>

Abstract: This is the second paper on the global geometry of Birkar's moduli of stable minimal models (e.g., the KSBA moduli stack). We introduces a birationally admissible stratification of the Deligne-Mumford stack of stable minimal models, such that the universal family over each stratum admits a simple normal crossing log birational model. The main result of this paper is to show that for each stratum $S$, the pair $(\overline{S},\partial S)$ satisfies the Big Picard theorem. In particular, we show that each stratum $S$ of the moduli stack is Borel hyperbolic and Brody hyperbolic.</description>

Abstract: We construct a hyperplane section $Y$ of a Milnor hypersurface associated to a regular semisimple endomorphism $\varphi$. Exploiting its structure as a hyperplane section of a projective bundle and its natural torus action, we give a motivic decomposition of $Y$, which encodes both the cellular structure of $Y$ and the arithmetic of the eigenvalues of $\varphi$. This decomposition is proven without using the "nilpotence principle", that is to say there are no "phantoms".</description>

      <title>Positive equilibria in mass action networks: geometry and bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results on the geometry of the positive equilibrium set of a mass action network. Any mass action network gives rise to a parameterised family of polynomial equations whose positive solutions are the positive equilibria of the network. Here, we start by deriving alternative systems of equations, whose solutions are in smooth, one-to-one correspondence with positive equilibria of the network, and capture degeneracy or nondegeneracy of the corresponding equilibria. The derivation leads us to consider partitions of networks in a natural sense, and we explore the implications of choosing different partitions. The alternative systems are often simpler than the original mass action equations, sometimes giving explicit parameterisations of positive equilibria, and allowing us to rapidly identify various algebraic and geometric properties of the positive equilibrium set, including toricity and local toricity. We can use the approaches we develop to bound the number of positive nondegenerate equilibria on stoichiometric classes; to derive semialgebraic descriptions of the parameter regions for multistationarity; and to study bifurcations. We present the main construction, various consequences for particular classes of networks, and numerous examples. We also develop additional techniques specifically for quadratic networks, the most common class of networks in applications, and use these techniques to derive strengthened results for quadratic networks.</description>

      <title>On the Hermitian K-theory of Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the $\mathbb{G}W$-spectrum of Grassmannians over fields of characteristic zero. We also compute the stabilized $\mathbb{L}$-Theory spectrum of Grassmannians. As part of our computation, we establish split fibration sequences in $\mathbb{K}$-Theory, $\mathbb{G}W$-Theory and $\mathbb{L}$-Theory. We observe, via base-change for exceptional collections, that our computations are valid for Grassmannians over commutative rings containing a field of characteristic zero. Along the way, some combinatorial identities involving Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are established, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1$-orbifolds and topological difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(m_1, m_2)$ be a pair of positive integers. Denote by $\mathbb{P}^1$ the complex projective line, and by $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$ the orbifold complex projective line obtained from $\mathbb{P}^1$ by adding $\mathbb{Z}_{m_1}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{m_2}$ orbifold points. In this paper we introduce a matrix linear difference equation, prove existence and uniqueness of its formal Puiseux-series solutions, and use them to give conjectural formulas for $k$-point ($k\ge2$) functions of Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$. Explicit expressions of the unique solutions are also obtained. We carry out concrete computations of the first few invariants by using the conjectural formulas. For the case when one of $m_1, m_2$ equals 1, we prove validity of the conjectural formulas.</description>
