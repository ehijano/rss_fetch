      <title>Planet Earth in reflected and polarized light I. 3D radiative transfer simulations of realistic surface-atmosphere systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future telescopes will characterize rocky exoplanets in reflected light, revealing their albedo, which depends on surface, cloud, and atmospheric properties. Identifying these features is crucial for assessing habitability. We present reference spectra and phase curves for an unresolved Earth-like exoplanet in reflected and polarized light, showing how phase- and wavelength-dependent reflectance reveals key planetary properties. Using the 3D radiative transfer code MYSTIC, we enhance surface and cloud modeling with validated, wavelength-dependent albedo maps of Earth's seasonal and spectral features, alongside a novel treatment of sub-grid cloud variability using ERA5 reanalysis data. Our models, incorporating high-resolution 3D cloud structures, show that sub-grid cloud variability reduces total reflectance and increases phase curve variability, especially at large phase angles where ocean glint dominates. We also find that neglecting wavelength-dependent albedo maps overestimates the vegetation red edge in spectra. Comparing an Ocean planet to an Earth-like planet with seasonal cloud variability, we show that polarization is more sensitive than intensity alone in distinguishing both cases. Moreover, polarization captures richer surface details, making it a crucial tool for resolving retrieval degeneracies. Our simulations serve as a reference for observing Earth as an exoplanet and provide benchmarks for optimizing observational strategies and retrieval frameworks for future telescopes targeting small, rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy of N2O Solid Simulating the haze of trans-Neptunian objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \ Nitrous oxide (N$_2$O) ice is likely to exist in trans-Neptunian objects such as Pluto and Triton, potentially formed through ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun or cosmic ray irradiation of N$_2$ and CO ices. However, the mid-infrared spectral characteristics of N$_2$O ice in higher temperature regions (90-110 K), changes in mid-infrared spectra during UV irradiation, and the chemical network of nitrogen oxide (N$_x$O$_y$) ices remain insufficiently understood. This study aims to elucidate these aspects through in-situ mid-infrared spectral measurements of cryogenic particles using two-dimensional imaging Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
  Spectroscopic imaging confirmed strong absorption at 7.75 $\mu$m (N$_2$O $\nu_1$ vibrational mode), with weaker vibrational modes observed at 8.60 $\mu$m (N$_2$O 2$\nu_2$), 7.27 $\mu$m (N$_2$O torsion), and 5.29 $\mu$m (N$_2$O $\nu_1$+$\nu_2$). Annealing experiments simulating high-temperature conditions demonstrated that all vibrational modes irreversibly intensified with increasing temperature, indicating progressive crystallization. New spectral features appeared at approximately 12 $\mu$m and 14 $\mu$m at the condensed sample.
  N$_2$O ice was exposed to ultraviolet radiation (190-340 nm) using a D$_2$ lamp for 8.5 hours to investigate spectral changes during UV irradiation. After 60-90 minutes of irradiation, all N$_2$O vibrational modes disappeared, while absorption intensities of various nitrogen oxides, including NO, NO$_2$, N$_2$O$_3$, and O$_3$ increased. Beyond 180 minutes, vibrational modes of multiple nitrogen oxide ices exhibited intensity variations across different wavelengths, corresponding to other species such as cis-(NO)$_2$, N$_2$O$_4$, and N$_2$O$_5$.</description>

      <title>Identifying misclassified meteor showers in the IAU MDC database. Reclassification Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of meteoroid streams reveals the full complexity of these structures. At present, we have no objective method of deciding whether the parameters of the observed meteoroid stream represent a further solution to an already known object or whether they relate to a new discovery. As result, the Meteor Data Center (MDC) database of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) contains duplicates and false duplicates of the meteor showers.
  It is desirable to detect questionable cases and, if possible, correct their status, thereby contributing to the improvement of the content of the IAU MDC database. The correct content of the MDC database is important in its applications, for example, in assessing the threat from meteoroids to Earth's artificial satellites.
  Two approaches were used, in the first the internal compatibility of geocentric and heliocentric parameters representing a given flux was verified. In the second, a comparison of two or more solutions of the same stream was made in as much detail as possible. Fifty-six streams were verified, for which clear suspicion of misclassification was established in our earlier work.
  For 43 streams, the misclassification was confirmed, with a proposal to change their status in the MDC to autonomous. In the remaining 13 cases, it was proposed to leave their status unchanged.
  Although we do not consider it 'definitive', our study clearly shows that repeated misclassification of new meteoroid flux solutions has occurred in the past. Correction of these cases will significantly improve the content of the MDC database. As an additional product, based on the approach proposed in this and our earlier work, relevant procedures have been proposed, which, available on the MDC database website, will make it possible to compare new meteoroid data with the contents of the database, thereby avoiding errors in their classification.</description>

      <title>Size and shape of the trans-Neptunian object (470316) 2007 OC10: Comparison with thermal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shapes of only 12 trans-Neptunian objects have been directly measured, offering crucial insights into their internal structure. These properties are strongly connected to the processes that shaped the early Solar System, and provide important clues about its evolution.
  The aim of the present work is to characterise the size, shape, geometric albedo, and beaming parameter of the TNO (470316) 2007 OC10 . We compared these values to the effective diameter and geometric albedo obtained from thermal data by the TNOs are Cool survey. We also combined occultation and thermal data to constrain the size of a putative unresolved satellite.
  We predicted an occultation of the star Gaia DR3 2727866328215869952 by 2007 OC10 on 2022 August 22. Four stations detected the occultation. We implemented an elliptical shape model for the projection of 2007 OC10. Following a Bayesian approach, we obtained the posterior probability density in the model parameter space using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method.
  The elliptical limb of 2007 OC10 has semi-axes of $ 215^{+10}_{-7} \times 141 ^{+24}_{-23}$ km, and thus the projected axis ratio is $b/a = 0.58^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$. The area-equivalent diameter is $330^{+56}_{-55}$,km. From our own absolute magnitude value of $H_V = 5.40 \pm 0.02$, the geometric albedo is $p_V = 11.2 ^{+2.1}_{-5.0}$ %. Combining the occultation results with thermal data, we constrain the beaming parameter to $\eta = 1.42^{+0.75}_{-0.58}$. Occultation data reveal that the star is double. The secondary star has a position angle with respect to the primary of $56^{+3}_{-17}$ degrees, has an angular separation of $57^{+4}_{-11}$ mas, and is $1.18^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$ magnitudes fainter than the primary.</description>

      <title>An MHD Simulation of the Possible Modulations of Stellar CMEs Radio Observations by an Exoplanetary Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II radio bursts are the indicator of adverse space weather in a stellar system. These radio bursts are the consequence of shock wave acceleration due to the coronal mass ejection (CME). Here, we perform a series of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a CME-driven star-planet system in order to investigate the modulation in radio burst mechanism by a close-in exoplanetary system. We use a model for the stellar wind with a close-in exoplanet, and a CME model based on the eruption of a flux rope. We are able to generate synthetic radio burst images from our MHD simulations. We find that radio burst like phenomena is most likely to be observed for moderately active solar like stars and close-in exoplanetary systems have significant influence on the nature of radio burst spectrum. We find that when the planetary field is not too strong, the planetary magnetosphere is pushing against the CME, increasing its density so the radio burst is visible at higher frequencies. When the planetary field is very strong, the large magnetosphere does not leave room for the CME shock to evolve so the radio burst is more visible in the lower frequencies associated with the weak compression at the flanks of the CME shock. In case of highly active solar-like stars, strong overlying stellar fields weakens the solar-like CME shock, thus generates very weak (almost non-visible) radio burst signals. For HD 189733 (moderate stellar field), only intensity difference is visible when the CME arrives the planet. We also do not find significant modulation in the radio emission by a close-in exoplanet system when the stellar magnetic field is complex. In summary, our result suggests that the nature of the radio burst spectrum is highly dependent on the topology of the stellar magnetic field and the close-in exoplanetary magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>The Gradient of Mean Molecular Weight Across the Radius Valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-evaporation shapes the observed radii of small exoplanets and constrains the underlying distributions of atmospheric and core masses. However, the diversity of atmospheric chemistries corresponding to these distributions remains unelucidated. We develop a first-principles carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-sulfur-silicon (CHOSSi) outgassing model that accounts for non-ideal gas behavior (via fugacities) at high pressures, as well as the tendency for water and hydrogen to dissolve in melt (via solubility laws). We use data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between the atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes. Sub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial hydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt temperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead thermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and silicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a diversity of mean molecular weights. Our geochemical outgassing calculations robustly predict a gradient of mean molecular weight across the radius valley, where the strength of this gradient is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity of the molten cores and not by the carbon enrichment (or "metallicity") of the atmosphere. Smaller sub-Neptunes are predicted to have less hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The precise relationship between the observed and outgassed chemistries requires an understanding of how convection near the core interacts with large-scale atmospheric circulation (driven by stellar heating) near the photosphere, as well as the influence of photochemistry.</description>

      <title>Helium escape signatures are generally strongest during younger ages but this age dependence is lost in the diversity of observed exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly irradiated exoplanets undergo extreme hydrodynamic atmospheric escape, due to their high level of received XUV flux. Over their lifetime, this escape varies significantly, making evolution studies essential for interpreting the growing number of observations of escaping planetary atmospheres. In a previous work, we modelled this evolving escape, alongside one of its observable tracers, the helium triplet transit signature at 1083nm. Using hydrodynamic and ray-tracing models, we demonstrated that atmospheric escape and the corresponding He 1083nm signature are stronger at younger ages, for a 0.3$~M_\text{J}$ gas-giant. Yet, the current literature includes several young (&lt;1Gyr) planets with weak or non-detections in He 1083nm. To understand this apparent discrepancy, we now perform detailed modelling for many of these systems. The resulting He 1083nm predictions align relatively well with the observations. From our two studies, we conclude that for any given planet, stronger atmospheric escape during younger ages produces deeper He 1083nm absorption. However, for a population of exoplanets, the relation between younger ages and stronger He absorptions is lost to the broad diversity of their various other system parameters. Accordingly, for the current sample of young, 1083nm-observed exoplanets, alternative trends take precedence. One such trend is that planets with deeper geometrical transits exhibit more favourable detections. Our modelling also agrees with the strong empirical trend in the literature between $ EW \cdot R_{*}^{2}$ and $F_{\text{xuv}} \cdot R_{\text{pl}}^2 / \Phi_{g}$. Additionally, we show that the coupling between the lower and upper atmospheres is necessary for a robust prediction of the 1083nm signature.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray ionisation of a post-impact early Earth atmosphere: Solar cosmic ray ionisation must be considered in origin-of-life scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CR), both solar and Galactic, have an ionising effect on the Earth's atmosphere and are thought to be important for prebiotic molecule production. In particular, the $\rm{H_2}$-dominated atmosphere following an ocean-vaporising impact is considered favourable to prebiotic molecule formation. We model solar and Galactic CR transport through a post-impact early Earth atmosphere at 200Myr. We aim to identify the differences in the resulting ionisation rates, $\zeta$, particularly at the Earth's surface during a period when the Sun was very active. We use a Monte Carlo model to describe CR transport through the early Earth atmosphere, giving the CR spectra as a function of altitude. We calculate $\zeta$ and the ion-pair production rate, $Q$, as a function of altitude due to Galactic and solar CR. The Galactic and solar CR spectra are both affected by the Sun's rotation rate, $\Omega$, because the solar wind velocity and magnetic field strength both depend on $\Omega$ and influence CR transport. We consider a range of input spectra resulting from the range of possible $\Omega$, from $3.5-15\, \Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$. To account for the possibility that the Galactic CR spectrum outside the Solar System varies over Gyr timescales, we compare top-of-atmosphere $\zeta$ resulting from two different scenarios. We also consider the suppression of the CR spectra by a planetary magnetic field. We find that $\zeta$ and $Q$ due to CR are dominated by solar CR in the early Earth atmosphere for most cases. The corresponding $\zeta$ at the early Earth's surface ranges from $5 \times 10^{-21}\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\Omega = 3.5\,\Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$ to $1 \times 10^{-16}\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\Omega = 15\,\Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$. Thus if the young Sun was a fast rotator, it is likely that solar CR had a significant effect on the chemistry at the Earth's surface at the time when life is likely to have formed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and Atmospheric Characterization of the Substellar Companion HD 33632 Ab from Direct Imaging, Astrometry, and Radial-Velocity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present follow-up SCExAO/CHARIS $H$ and $K$-band (R $\sim$ 70) high-contrast integral field spectroscopy and Keck/NIRC2 photometry of directly-imaged brown dwarf companion HD 33632 Ab and new radial-velocity data for the system from the SOPHIE spectrograph, complemented by Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry. These data enable more robust spectral characterization compared to lower-resolution spectra from the discovery paper and more than double the available astrometric and radial-velocity baseline. HD 33632 Ab's spectrum is well reproduced by a field L8.5--L9.5 dwarf. Using the Exo-REM atmosphere models, we derive a best-fit temperature, surface gravity and radius of $T_{\rm eff}$ = 1250 $K$, log(g) = 5, and $R$ = 0.97 $R_{\rm J}$ and a solar C/O ratio. Adding the SOPHIE radial-velocity data enables far tighter constraints on the companion's orbital properties (e.g. $i$=${47.5}_{-4.7}^{+2.5}$$^{o}$) and dynamical mass (${52.8}_{-2.4}^{+2.6}$$M_{\rm J}$) than derived from imaging data and \textit{Gaia} eDR3 astrometry data alone. HD 33632 Ab should be a prime target for multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} and the \textit{Roman Space Telescope}'s Coronagraphic Instrument, shedding detailed light on HD 33632 Ab's clouds and chemistry and providing a key reference point for understanding young exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Methods to Characterise Exoplanet Host Stars from Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key to understand exoplanets is characterisation of their host stars. One of the most powerful tools to characterise stellar properties like effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity, is spectroscopy based on observations of stellar atmospheres. This chapter describes the stellar parameters that can be derived from a spectrum with examples of well established methods and theoretical model atmospheres. Combined with photometry and parallax measurements, the outcome of the spectroscopic modelling can be used to derive stellar radii and masses.</description>

      <title>A cometary Fluorescence Model for the $\nu_3$ Vibrational Band of Cyanogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyanogen ($\mathrm{C_2N_2}$) is suspected for a long time to be present in comets and to contribute to the creation of CN radical. So far no observations with ground-based facilities managed to detect this species but the Rosetta mission, thanks to in situ observations with the ROSINA mass spectrometer detected this species in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. To investigate its presence from infrared spectra in other comets, we developed a fluorescence model for the $\nu_3$ fundamental band. From new laboratory high-resolution infrared spectra of cyanogen, we analyzed the region of the $\nu_3$ band of $\mathrm{C_2N_2}$, centered around 4.63 $\mu m$ (2158 $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). In addition to line positions and intensities, molecular parameters for the ground and excited vibrational state were obtained. These parameters allowed us to develop a fluorescence model for cyanogen. Excitation rates of the $\nu_3$ band of cyanogen in cometary comae are presented. An attempt to detect cyanogen in a high-resolution spectrum of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is discussed.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Particle Transport at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>

Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>
