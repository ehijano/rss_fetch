      <title>Automatic parking planning control method based on improved A* algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the trend of moving away from high-precision maps gradually emerges in the autonomous driving industry,traditional planning algorithms are gradually exposing some problems. To address the high real-time, high precision, and high trajectory quality requirements posed by the automatic parking task under real-time perceived local maps,this paper proposes an improved automatic parking planning algorithm based on the A* algorithm, and uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) as the control module for automatic parking.The algorithm enhances the planning real-time performance by optimizing heuristic functions, binary heap optimization, and bidirectional search; it calculates the passability of narrow areas by dynamically loading obstacles and introduces the vehicle's own volume during planning; it improves trajectory quality by using neighborhood expansion and Bezier curve optimization methods to meet the high trajectory quality requirements of the parking task. After obtaining the output results of the planning algorithm, a loss function is designed according to the characteristics of the automatic parking task under local maps, and the MPC algorithm is used to output control commands to drive the car along the planned trajectory. This paper uses the perception results of real driving environments converted into maps as planning inputs to conduct simulation tests and ablation experiments on the algorithm. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively meet the special requirements of automatic parking under local maps and complete the automatic parking planning and control tasks.</description>

      <title>Automated Parking Planning with Vision-Based BEV Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Valet Parking (AVP) is a crucial component of advanced autonomous driving systems, focusing on the endpoint task within the "human-vehicle interaction" process to tackle the challenges of the "last mile".The perception module of the automated parking algorithm has evolved from local perception using ultrasonic radar and global scenario precise map matching for localization to a high-level map-free Birds Eye View (BEV) perception solution.The BEV scene places higher demands on the real-time performance and safety of automated parking planning tasks. This paper proposes an improved automated parking algorithm based on the A* algorithm, integrating vehicle kinematic models, heuristic function optimization, bidirectional search, and Bezier curve optimization to enhance the computational speed and real-time capabilities of the planning algorithm.Numerical optimization methods are employed to generate the final parking trajectory, ensuring the safety of the parking path. The proposed approach is experimentally validated in the commonly used industrial CARLA-ROS joint simulation environment. Compared to traditional algorithms, this approach demonstrates reduced computation time with more challenging collision-risk test cases and improved performance in comfort metrics.</description>

      <title>WundtGPT: Shaping Large Language Models To Be An Empathetic, Proactive Psychologist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are raging over the medical domain, and their momentum has carried over into the mental health domain, leading to the emergence of few mental health LLMs. Although such mental health LLMs could provide reasonable suggestions for psychological counseling, how to develop an authentic and effective doctor-patient relationship (DPR) through LLMs is still an important problem. To fill this gap, we dissect DPR into two key attributes, i.e., the psychologist's empathy and proactive guidance. We thus present WundtGPT, an empathetic and proactive mental health large language model that is acquired by fine-tuning it with instruction and real conversation between psychologists and patients. It is designed to assist psychologists in diagnosis and help patients who are reluctant to communicate face-to-face understand their psychological conditions. Its uniqueness lies in that it could not only pose purposeful questions to guide patients in detailing their symptoms but also offer warm emotional reassurance. In particular, WundtGPT incorporates Collection of Questions, Chain of Psychodiagnosis, and Empathy Constraints into a comprehensive prompt for eliciting LLMs' questions and diagnoses. Additionally, WundtGPT proposes a reward model to promote alignment with empathetic mental health professionals, which encompasses two key factors: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. Based on these outcomes, we further conduct the manual evaluation based on proactivity, effectiveness, professionalism and coherence. We notice that WundtGPT can offer professional and effective consultation. The model is available at huggingface.</description>

      <title>CSRT: Evaluation and Analysis of LLMs using Code-Switching Red-Teaming Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) shed light on their multilingual ability and safety, beyond conventional tasks in language modeling. Still, current benchmarks reveal their inability to comprehensively evaluate them and are excessively dependent on manual annotations. In this paper, we introduce code-switching red-teaming (CSRT), a simple yet effective red-teaming technique that simultaneously tests multilingual understanding and safety of LLMs. We release the CSRT dataset, which comprises 315 code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages and eliciting a wide range of undesirable behaviors. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than existing methods in English. We analyze the harmful responses toward the CSRT dataset concerning various aspects under ablation studies with 16K samples, including but not limited to scaling laws, unsafe behavior categories, and input conditions for optimal data generation. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of CSRT, by generating code-switching attack prompts with monolingual data.</description>

      <title>PKU-SafeRLHF: A Safety Alignment Preference Dataset for Llama Family Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, designed to promote research on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs). As a sibling project to SafeRLHF and BeaverTails, we separate annotations of helpfulness and harmlessness for question-answering pairs, providing distinct perspectives on these coupled attributes. Overall, we provide 44.6k refined prompts and 265k question-answer pairs with safety meta-labels for 19 harm categories and three severity levels ranging from minor to severe, with answers generated by Llama-family models. Based on this, we collected 166.8k preference data, including dual-preference (helpfulness and harmlessness decoupled) and single-preference data (trade-off the helpfulness and harmlessness from scratch), respectively. Using the large-scale annotation data, we further train severity-sensitive moderation for the risk control of LLMs and safety-centric RLHF algorithms for the safety alignment of LLMs. We believe this dataset will be a valuable resource for the community, aiding in the safe deployment of LLMs.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Approaches for Optimizing Power Consumption: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced environmental effect, lower operating costs, and a stable and sustainable energy supply for current and future generations are the main reasons why power optimization is important. Power optimization makes ensuring that energy is used more effectively, cutting down on waste and optimizing the utilization of resources.In today's world, power optimization and artificial intelligence (AI) integration are essential to changing the way energy is produced, used, and distributed. Real-time monitoring and analysis of power usage trends is made possible by AI-driven algorithms and predictive analytics, which enable dynamic modifications to effectively satisfy demand. Efficiency and sustainability are increased when power consumption is optimized in different sectors thanks to the use of intelligent systems. This survey paper comprises an extensive review of the several AI techniques used for power optimization as well as a methodical analysis of the literature for the study of various intelligent system application domains across different disciplines of power consumption.This literature review identifies the performance and outcomes of 17 different research methods by assessing them, and it aims to distill valuable insights into their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, this article outlines future directions in the integration of AI for power consumption optimization.</description>

      <title>Data Issues in Industrial AI System: A Meta-Review and Research Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence (AI) is assuming an increasingly pivotal role within industrial systems. Despite the recent trend within various industries to adopt AI, the actual adoption of AI is not as developed as perceived. A significant factor contributing to this lag is the data issues in AI implementation. How to address these data issues stands as a significant concern confronting both industry and academia. To address data issues, the first step involves mapping out these issues. Therefore, this study conducts a meta-review to explore data issues and methods within the implementation of industrial AI. Seventy-two data issues are identified and categorized into various stages of the data lifecycle, including data source and collection, data access and storage, data integration and interoperation, data pre-processing, data processing, data security and privacy, and AI technology adoption. Subsequently, the study analyzes the data requirements of various AI algorithms. Building on the aforementioned analyses, it proposes a data management framework, addressing how data issues can be systematically resolved at every stage of the data lifecycle. Finally, the study highlights future research directions. In doing so, this study enriches the existing body of knowledge and provides guidelines for professionals navigating the complex landscape of achieving data usability and usefulness in industrial AI.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Planning for Stochastic Control on Constrained Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the world of stochastic control, especially in economics and engineering, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can effectively model various stochastic decision processes, from asset management to transportation optimization. These underlying MDPs, upon closer examination, often reveal a specifically constrained causal structure concerning the transition and reward dynamics. By exploiting this structure, we can obtain a reduction in the causal representation of the problem setting, allowing us to solve of the optimal value function more efficiently. This work defines an MDP framework, the \texttt{SD-MDP}, where we disentangle the causal structure of MDPs' transition and reward dynamics, providing distinct partitions on the temporal causal graph. With this stochastic reduction, the \texttt{SD-MDP} reflects a general class of resource allocation problems. This disentanglement further enables us to derive theoretical guarantees on the estimation error of the value function under an optimal policy by allowing independent value estimation from Monte Carlo sampling. Subsequently, by integrating this estimator into well-known Monte Carlo planning algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive bounds on the simple regret of the algorithm. Finally, we quantify the policy improvement of MCTS under the \texttt{SD-MDP} framework by demonstrating that the MCTS planning algorithm achieves higher expected reward (lower costs) under a constant simulation budget, on a tangible economic example based on maritime refuelling.</description>

      <title>GraphEval2000: Benchmarking and Improving Large Language Models on Graph Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating significant capabilities in processing and understanding text data. However, recent studies have identified limitations in LLMs' ability to reason about graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce GraphEval2000, the first comprehensive graph dataset, comprising 40 graph data structure problems along with 2000 test cases. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework based on GraphEval2000, designed to assess the graph reasoning abilities of LLMs through coding challenges. Our dataset categorizes test cases into four primary and four sub-categories, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation. We evaluate eight popular LLMs on GraphEval2000, revealing that LLMs exhibit a better understanding of directed graphs compared to undirected ones. While private LLMs consistently outperform open-source models, the performance gap is narrowing. Furthermore, to improve the usability of our evaluation framework, we propose Structured Symbolic Decomposition (SSD), an instruction-based method designed to enhance LLM performance on GraphEval2000. Results show that SSD improves the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o on complex graph problems, with an increase of 11.11\%, 33.37\%, and 33.37\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Trace is the New AutoDiff -- Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

      <title>Memory-Enhanced Neural Solvers for Efficient Adaptation in Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization is crucial to numerous real-world applications, yet still presents challenges due to its (NP-)hard nature. Amongst existing approaches, heuristics often offer the best trade-off between quality and scalability, making them suitable for industrial use. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a flexible framework for designing heuristics, its adoption over handcrafted heuristics remains incomplete within industrial solvers. Existing learned methods still lack the ability to adapt to specific instances and fully leverage the available computational budget. The current best methods either rely on a collection of pre-trained policies, or on data-inefficient fine-tuning; hence failing to fully utilize newly available information within the constraints of the budget. In response, we present MEMENTO, an RL approach that leverages memory to improve the adaptation of neural solvers at inference time. MEMENTO enables updating the action distribution dynamically based on the outcome of previous decisions. We validate its effectiveness on benchmark problems, in particular Traveling Salesman and Capacitated Vehicle Routing, demonstrating it can successfully be combined with standard methods to boost their performance under a given budget, both in and out-of-distribution, improving their performance on all 12 evaluated tasks.</description>

      <title>Guardrails for avoiding harmful medical product recommendations and off-label promotion in generative AI models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide variety of medical tasks. However, as these models are trained using generalist datasets with very limited human oversight, they can learn uses of medical products that have not been adequately evaluated for safety and efficacy, nor approved by regulatory agencies. Given the scale at which GenAI may reach users, unvetted recommendations pose a public health risk. In this work, we propose an approach to identify potentially harmful product recommendations, and demonstrate it using a recent multimodal large language model.</description>

      <title>Towards Comprehensive Preference Data Collection for Reward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) facilitates the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, thereby enhancing the quality of responses generated. A critical component of RLHF is the reward model, which is trained on preference data and outputs a scalar reward during the inference stage. However, the collection of preference data still lacks thorough investigation. Recent studies indicate that preference data is collected either by AI or humans, where chosen and rejected instances are identified among pairwise responses. We question whether this process effectively filters out noise and ensures sufficient diversity in collected data. To address these concerns, for the first time, we propose a comprehensive framework for preference data collection, decomposing the process into four incremental steps: Prompt Generation, Response Generation, Response Filtering, and Human Labeling. This structured approach ensures the collection of high-quality preferences while reducing reliance on human labor. We conducted comprehensive experiments based on the data collected at different stages, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed data collection method.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms and Embeddings of STRIPS Planning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining whether two STRIPS planning instances are isomorphic is the simplest form of comparison between planning instances. It is also a particular case of the problem concerned with finding an isomorphism between a planning instance $P$ and a sub-instance of another instance $P_0$ . One application of such a mapping is to efficiently produce a compiled form containing all solutions to P from a compiled form containing all solutions to $P_0$. We also introduce the notion of embedding from an instance $P$ to another instance $P_0$, which allows us to deduce that $P_0$ has no solution-plan if $P$ is unsolvable. In this paper, we study the complexity of these problems. We show that the first is GI-complete, and can thus be solved, in theory, in quasi-polynomial time. While we prove the remaining problems to be NP-complete, we propose an algorithm to build an isomorphism, when possible. We report extensive experimental trials on benchmark problems which demonstrate conclusively that applying constraint propagation in preprocessing can greatly improve the efficiency of a SAT solver.</description>

      <title>Hacking a surrogate model approach to XAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the number of new applications for highly complex AI systems has risen significantly. Algorithmic decision-making systems (ADMs) are one of such applications, where an AI system replaces the decision-making process of a human expert. As one approach to ensure fairness and transparency of such systems, explainable AI (XAI) has become more important. One variant to achieve explainability are surrogate models, i.e., the idea to train a new simpler machine learning model based on the input-output-relationship of a black box model. The simpler machine learning model could, for example, be a decision tree, which is thought to be intuitively understandable by humans. However, there is not much insight into how well the surrogate model approximates the black box.
  Our main assumption is that a good surrogate model approach should be able to bring such a discriminating behavior to the attention of humans; prior to our research we assumed that a surrogate decision tree would identify such a pattern on one of its first levels. However, in this article we show that even if the discriminated subgroup - while otherwise being the same in all categories - does not get a single positive decision from the black box ADM system, the corresponding question of group membership can be pushed down onto a level as low as wanted by the operator of the system.
  We then generalize this finding to pinpoint the exact level of the tree on which the discriminating question is asked and show that in a more realistic scenario, where discrimination only occurs to some fraction of the disadvantaged group, it is even more feasible to hide such discrimination.
  Our approach can be generalized easily to other surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Expected Runtime Comparisons Between Breadth-First Search and Constant-Depth Restarting Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When greedy search algorithms encounter a local minima or plateau, the search typically devolves into a breadth-first search (BrFS), or a local search technique is used in an attempt to find a way out. In this work, we formally analyze the performance of BrFS and constant-depth restarting random walks (RRW) -- two methods often used for finding exits to a plateau/local minima -- to better understand when each is best suited. In particular, we formally derive the expected runtime for BrFS in the case of a uniformly distributed set of goals at a given goal depth. We then prove RRW will be faster than BrFS on trees if there are enough goals at that goal depth. We refer to this threshold as the crossover point. Our bound shows that the crossover point grows linearly with the branching factor of the tree, the goal depth, and the error in the random walk depth, while the size of the tree grows exponentially in branching factor and goal depth. Finally, we discuss the practical implications and applicability of this bound.</description>

      <title>CausalMMM: Learning Causal Structure for Marketing Mix Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online advertising, marketing mix modeling (MMM) is employed to predict the gross merchandise volume (GMV) of brand shops and help decision-makers to adjust the budget allocation of various advertising channels. Traditional MMM methods leveraging regression techniques can fail in handling the complexity of marketing. Although some efforts try to encode the causal structures for better prediction, they have the strict restriction that causal structures are prior-known and unchangeable. In this paper, we define a new causal MMM problem that automatically discovers the interpretable causal structures from data and yields better GMV predictions. To achieve causal MMM, two essential challenges should be addressed: (1) Causal Heterogeneity. The causal structures of different kinds of shops vary a lot. (2) Marketing Response Patterns. Various marketing response patterns i.e., carryover effect and shape effect, have been validated in practice. We argue that causal MMM needs dynamically discover specific causal structures for different shops and the predictions should comply with the prior known marketing response patterns. Thus, we propose CausalMMM that integrates Granger causality in a variational inference framework to measure the causal relationships between different channels and predict the GMV with the regularization of both temporal and saturation marketing response patterns. Extensive experiments show that CausalMMM can not only achieve superior performance of causal structure learning on synthetic datasets with improvements of 5.7%\sim 7.1%, but also enhance the GMV prediction results on a representative E-commerce platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in educational settings have sparked considerable debate regarding their efficacy and acceptability.Despite the potential benefits, the assimilation of these cutting-edge technologies among educators exhibits a broad spectrum of attitudes, from enthusiastic advocacy to profound skepticism.This study aims to dissect the underlying factors influencing educators' perceptions and acceptance of GenAI and LLMs.We conducted a survey among educators and analyzed the data through the frameworks of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT). Our investigation reveals a strong positive correlation between the perceived usefulness of GenAI tools and their acceptance, underscoring the importance of demonstrating tangible benefits to educators. Additionally, the perceived ease of use emerged as a significant factor, though to a lesser extent, influencing acceptance. Our findings also show that the knowledge and acceptance of these tools is not uniform, suggesting that targeted strategies are required to address the specific needs and concerns of each adopter category to facilitate broader integration of AI tools.in education.</description>

      <title>Affirmative safety: An approach to risk management for high-risk AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prominent AI experts have suggested that companies developing high-risk AI systems should be required to show that such systems are safe before they can be developed or deployed. The goal of this paper is to expand on this idea and explore its implications for risk management. We argue that entities developing or deploying high-risk AI systems should be required to present evidence of affirmative safety: a proactive case that their activities keep risks below acceptable thresholds. We begin the paper by highlighting global security risks from AI that have been acknowledged by AI experts and world governments. Next, we briefly describe principles of risk management from other high-risk fields (e.g., nuclear safety). Then, we propose a risk management approach for advanced AI in which model developers must provide evidence that their activities keep certain risks below regulator-set thresholds. As a first step toward understanding what affirmative safety cases should include, we illustrate how certain kinds of technical evidence and operational evidence can support an affirmative safety case. In the technical section, we discuss behavioral evidence (evidence about model outputs), cognitive evidence (evidence about model internals), and developmental evidence (evidence about the training process). In the operational section, we offer examples of organizational practices that could contribute to affirmative safety cases: information security practices, safety culture, and emergency response capacity. Finally, we briefly compare our approach to the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Overall, we hope our work contributes to ongoing discussions about national and global security risks posed by AI and regulatory approaches to address these risks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the evolution of occupations within the context of industry and technology life cycles, highlighting the critical yet underexplored intersection between occupational trends and broader economic dynamics. Introducing the Occupation Life Cycle (OLC) model, we delineate five stages (i.e., growth, peak, fluctuation, maturity, and decline) to systematically explore the trajectory of occupations. Utilizing job posting data from one of China's largest recruitment platforms as a novel proxy, our study meticulously tracks the fluctuations and emerging trends in the labor market from 2018 to 2023. Through a detailed examination of representative roles, such as short video operators and data analysts, alongside emerging occupations within the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, our findings allocate occupations to specific life cycle stages, revealing insightful patterns of occupational development and decline. Our findings offer a unique perspective on the interplay between occupational evolution and economic factors, with a particular focus on the rapidly changing Chinese labor market. This study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of OLC but also provides practical insights for policymakers, educators, and industry leaders facing the challenges of workforce planning and development in the face of technological advancement and market shifts.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Intelligence for Digital Humanities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the synergies between Digital Humanities (DH) as a discipline and Hybrid Intelligence (HI) as a research paradigm. In DH research, the use of digital methods and specifically that of Artificial Intelligence is subject to a set of requirements and constraints. We argue that these are well-supported by the capabilities and goals of HI. Our contribution includes the identification of five such DH requirements: Successful AI systems need to be able to 1) collaborate with the (human) scholar; 2) support data criticism; 3) support tool criticism; 4) be aware of and cater to various perspectives and 5) support distant and close reading. We take the CARE principles of Hybrid Intelligence (collaborative, adaptive, responsible and explainable) as theoretical framework and map these to the DH requirements. In this mapping, we include example research projects. We finally address how insights from DH can be applied to HI and discuss open challenges for the combination of the two disciplines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel software abstraction termed "model caller," acting as an intermediary for AI and ML model calling, advocating its transformative utility beyond existing model-serving frameworks. This abstraction offers multiple advantages: enhanced accuracy and reduced latency in model predictions, superior monitoring and observability of models, more streamlined AI system architectures, simplified AI development and management processes, and improved collaboration and accountability across AI/ML/Data Science, software, data, and operations teams. Model callers are valuable for both creators and users of models within both predictive and generative AI applications. Additionally, we have developed and released a prototype Python library for model callers, accessible for installation via pip or for download from GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper will bring forth the innovative pedagogical approach in computer science education, which uses a combination of methodologies borrowed from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and DevOps to enhance the learning experience in Content Management Systems (CMS) Development. It has been done over three academic years, comparing the traditional way of teaching with the lately introduced AI-supported techniques. This had three structured sprints, each one of them covering the major parts of the sprint: object-oriented PHP, theme development, and plugin development. In each sprint, the student deals with part of the theoretical content and part of the practical task, using ChatGPT as an auxiliary tool. In that sprint, the model will provide solutions in code debugging and extensions of complex problems. The course includes practical examples like code replication with PHP, functionality expansion of the CMS, even development of custom plugins, and themes. The course practice includes versions' control with Git repositories. Efficiency will touch the theme and plugin output rates during development and mobile/web application development. Comparative analysis indicates that there is a marked increase in efficiency and shows effectiveness with the proposed AI- and DevOps-supported methodology. The study is very informative since education in computer science and its landscape change embodies an emerging technology that could have transformation impacts on amplifying the potential for scalable and adaptive learning approaches.</description>

      <title>U Can't Gen This? A Survey of Intellectual Property Protection Methods for Data in Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Generative AI (GAI) models have the unparalleled ability to generate text, images, audio, and other forms of media that are increasingly indistinguishable from human-generated content. As these models often train on publicly available data, including copyrighted materials, art and other creative works, they inadvertently risk violating copyright and misappropriation of intellectual property (IP). Due to the rapid development of generative AI technology and pressing ethical considerations from stakeholders, protective mechanisms and techniques are emerging at a high pace but lack systematisation.
  In this paper, we study the concerns regarding the intellectual property rights of training data and specifically focus on the properties of generative models that enable misuse leading to potential IP violations. Then we propose a taxonomy that leads to a systematic review of technical solutions for safeguarding the data from intellectual property violations in GAI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the complex legal landscape surrounding digital assets, analysing how they are defined and regulated as property across various jurisdictions. As digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) increasingly integrate with global economies, their intangible nature presents unique challenges to traditional property law concepts, necessitating a re-evaluation of legal definitions and ownership frameworks. This research presents a comparative analysis, reviewing how different legal systems classify and manage digital assets within property law, highlighting the variations in regulatory approaches and their implications on ownership, transfer, and inheritance rights. By examining seminal cases and regulatory developments in major jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union, and Singapore, this paper explores the emerging trends and potential legal evolutions that could influence the global handling of digital assets. The study aims to contribute to the scholarly discourse by proposing a harmonized approach to digital asset regulation, seeking to balance innovation with legal certainty and consumer protection.</description>

      <title>An Exploratory Study on Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection through Variational Autoencoders and Trajectory Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) represents a challenging and prominent research task within computer vision. In recent years, Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection (PAD) has drawn considerable attention from the research community due to several inherent advantages over pixel-based approaches despite the occasional suboptimal performance. Specifically, PAD is characterized by reduced computational complexity, intrinsic privacy preservation, and the mitigation of concerns related to discrimination and bias against specific demographic groups. This paper introduces TSGAD, a novel human-centric Two-Stream Graph-Improved Anomaly Detection leveraging Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and trajectory prediction. TSGAD aims to explore the possibility of utilizing VAEs as a new approach for pose-based human-centric VAD alongside the benefits of trajectory prediction. We demonstrate TSGAD's effectiveness through comprehensive experimentation on benchmark datasets. TSGAD demonstrates comparable results with state-of-the-art methods showcasing the potential of adopting variational autoencoders. This suggests a promising direction for future research endeavors. The code base for this work is available at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/TSGAD.</description>

      <title>Feature Purified Transformer With Cross-level Feature Guiding Decoder For Multi-class OOD and Anomaly Deteciton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction networks are prevalently used in unsupervised anomaly and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection due to their independence from labeled anomaly data. However, in multi-class datasets, the effectiveness of anomaly detection is often compromised by the models' generalized reconstruction capabilities, which allow anomalies to blend within the expanded boundaries of normality resulting from the added categories, thereby reducing detection accuracy. We introduce the FUTUREG framework, which incorporates two innovative modules: the Feature Purification Module (FPM) and the CFG Decoder. The FPM constrains the normality boundary within the latent space to effectively filter out anomalous features, while the CFG Decoder uses layer-wise encoder representations to guide the reconstruction of filtered features, preserving fine-grained details. Together, these modules enhance the reconstruction error for anomalies, ensuring high-quality reconstructions for normal samples. Our results demonstrate that FUTUREG achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-class OOD settings and remains competitive in industrial anomaly detection scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deep Vision-Based Framework for Coastal Flood Prediction Under Climate Change Impacts and Shoreline Adaptations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of growing threats posed by climate change in general and sea level rise (SLR) in particular, the necessity for computationally efficient means to estimate and analyze potential coastal flood hazards has become increasingly pressing. Data-driven supervised learning methods serve as promising candidates that can dramatically expedite the process, thereby eliminating the computational bottleneck associated with traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators. Yet, the development of accurate and reliable coastal flood prediction models, especially those based on Deep Learning (DL) techniques, has been plagued with two major issues: (1) the scarcity of training data and (2) the high-dimensional output required for detailed inundation mapping. To remove this barrier, we present a systematic framework for training high-fidelity Deep Vision-based coastal flood prediction models in low-data settings. We test the proposed workflow on different existing vision models, including a fully transformer-based architecture and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with additive attention gates. Additionally, we introduce a deep CNN architecture tailored specifically to the coastal flood prediction problem at hand. The model was designed with a particular focus on its compactness so as to cater to resource-constrained scenarios and accessibility aspects. The performance of the developed DL models is validated against commonly adopted geostatistical regression methods and traditional Machine Learning (ML) approaches, demonstrating substantial improvement in prediction quality. Lastly, we round up the contributions by providing a meticulously curated dataset of synthetic flood inundation maps of Abu Dhabi's coast produced with a physics-based hydrodynamic simulator, which can serve as a benchmark for evaluating future coastal flood prediction models.</description>

      <title>RadEx: A Framework for Structured Information Extraction from Radiology Reports based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Annually and globally, over three billion radiography examinations and computer tomography scans result in mostly unstructured radiology reports containing free text. Despite the potential benefits of structured reporting, its adoption is limited by factors such as established processes, resource constraints and potential loss of information. However, structured information would be necessary for various use cases, including automatic analysis, clinical trial matching, and prediction of health outcomes. This study introduces RadEx, an end-to-end framework comprising 15 software components and ten artifacts to develop systems that perform automated information extraction from radiology reports. It covers the complete process from annotating training data to extracting information by offering a consistent generic information model and setting boundaries for model development. Specifically, RadEx allows clinicians to define relevant information for clinical domains (e.g., mammography) and to create report templates. The framework supports both generative and encoder-only models and the decoupling of information extraction from template filling enables independent model improvements. Developing information extraction systems according to the RadEx framework facilitates implementation and maintenance as components are easily exchangeable, while standardized artifacts ensure interoperability between components.</description>

      <title>Reasoning or Simply Next Token Prediction? A Benchmark for Stress-Testing Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose MMLU-SR, a novel dataset designed to measure the true comprehension abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by challenging their performance in question-answering tasks with modified terms. We reasoned that an agent that ``truly'' understands a concept can still evaluate it when key terms are replaced by suitably defined alternate terms, and sought to differentiate such comprehension from mere text replacement. In our study, we modified standardized test questions by replacing a key term with a dummy word along with its definition. The key term could be in the context of questions, answers, or both questions and answers.
  Notwithstanding the high scores achieved by recent popular LLMs on the MMLU leaderboard, we found a substantial reduction in model performance after such replacement, suggesting poor comprehension. This new benchmark provides a rigorous benchmark for testing true model comprehension, and poses a challenge to the broader scientific community.</description>

      <title>Mental Disorder Classification via Temporal Representation of Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental disorders pose a global challenge, aggravated by the shortage of qualified mental health professionals. Mental disorder prediction from social media posts by current LLMs is challenging due to the complexities of sequential text data and the limited context length of language models. Current language model-based approaches split a single data instance into multiple chunks to compensate for limited context size. The predictive model is then applied to each chunk individually, and the most voted output is selected as the final prediction. This results in the loss of inter-post dependencies and important time variant information, leading to poor performance. We propose a novel framework which first compresses the large sequence of chronologically ordered social media posts into a series of numbers. We then use this time variant representation for mental disorder classification. We demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our framework by outperforming the current SOTA in three different mental conditions: depression, self-harm, and anorexia, with an absolute improvement of 5% in the F1 score. We investigate the situation where current data instances fall within the context length of language models and present empirical results highlighting the importance of temporal properties of textual data. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed framework for a cross-domain study, exploring commonalities across disorders and the possibility of inter-domain data usage.</description>

      <title>Improving Large Models with Small models: Lower Costs and Better Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained large models (PLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, the significant computational requirements of PLMs have discouraged most product teams from running or fine-tuning them. In such cases, to harness the exceptional performance of PLMs, one must rely on expensive APIs, thereby exacerbating the economic burden. Despite the overall inferior performance of small models, in specific distributions, they can achieve comparable or even superior results. Consequently, some input can be processed exclusively by small models. On the other hand, certain tasks can be broken down into multiple subtasks, some of which can be completed without powerful capabilities. Under these circumstances, small models can handle the simple subtasks, allowing large models to focus on challenging subtasks, thus improving the performance. We propose Data Shunt$^+$ (DS$^+$), a general paradigm for collaboration of small and large models. DS$^+$ not only substantially reduces the cost associated with querying large models but also effectively improves large models' performance. For instance, ChatGPT achieves an accuracy of $94.43\%$ on Amazon Product sentiment analysis, and DS$^+$ achieves an accuracy of $95.64\%$, while the cost has been reduced to only $31.18\%$. Besides, experiments also prove that the proposed collaborative-based paradigm can better inject specific task knowledge into PLMs compared to fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic sentence representations for solving Textual Entailment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic spaces have proven to be suitable for modeling data of hierarchical nature. As such we use the Poincare ball to embed sentences with the goal of proving how hyperbolic spaces can be used for solving Textual Entailment. To this end, apart from the standard datasets used for evaluating textual entailment, we developed two additional datasets. We evaluate against baselines of various backgrounds, including LSTMs, Order Embeddings and Euclidean Averaging, which comes as a natural counterpart to representing sentences into the Euclidean space. We consistently outperform the baselines on the SICK dataset and are second only to Order Embeddings on the SNLI dataset, for the binary classification version of the entailment task.</description>

      <title>Intertwining CP and NLP: The Generation of Unreasonably Constrained Sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained text generation remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with hard constraints. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches prioritize generating meaningful and coherent output. Also, the current state-of-the-art methods often lack the expressiveness and constraint satisfaction capabilities to handle such tasks effectively. This paper presents the Constraints First Framework to remedy this issue. This framework considers a constrained text generation problem as a discrete combinatorial optimization problem. It is solved by a constraint programming method that combines linguistic properties (e.g., n-grams or language level) with other more classical constraints (e.g., the number of characters, syllables, or words). Eventually, a curation phase allows for selecting the best-generated sentences according to perplexity using a large language model. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by tackling a new more tediously constrained text generation problem: the iconic RADNER sentences problem. This problem aims to generate sentences respecting a set of quite strict rules defined by their use in vision and clinical research. Thanks to our CP-based approach, many new strongly constrained sentences have been successfully generated in an automatic manner. This highlights the potential of our approach to handle unreasonably constrained text generation scenarios.</description>

      <title>CrisisSense-LLM: Instruction Fine-Tuned Large Language Model for Multi-label Social Media Text Classification in Disaster Informatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of crisis/disaster informatics, social media is increasingly being used for improving situational awareness to inform response and relief efforts. Efficient and accurate text classification tools have been a focal area of investigation in crisis informatics. However, current methods mostly rely on single-label text classification models, which fails to capture different insights embedded in dynamic and multifaceted disaster-related social media data. This study introduces a novel approach to disaster text classification by enhancing a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) through instruction fine-tuning targeted for multi-label classification of disaster-related tweets. Our methodology involves creating a comprehensive instruction dataset from disaster-related tweets, which is then used to fine-tune an open-source LLM, thereby embedding it with disaster-specific knowledge. This fine-tuned model can classify multiple aspects of disaster-related information simultaneously, such as the type of event, informativeness, and involvement of human aid, significantly improving the utility of social media data for situational awareness in disasters. The results demonstrate that this approach enhances the categorization of critical information from social media posts, thereby facilitating a more effective deployment for situational awareness during emergencies. This research paves the way for more advanced, adaptable, and robust disaster management tools, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to improve real-time situational awareness and response strategies in disaster scenarios.</description>

      <title>Twin-Merging: Dynamic Integration of Modular Expertise in Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of large language models, model merging is a promising way to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model without extra training. However, two challenges remain: (a) interference between different models and (b) heterogeneous data during testing. Traditional model merging methods often show significant performance gaps compared to fine-tuned models due to these issues. Additionally, a one-size-fits-all model lacks flexibility for diverse test data, leading to performance degradation. We show that both shared and exclusive task-specific knowledge are crucial for merging performance, but directly merging exclusive knowledge hinders overall performance. In view of this, we propose Twin-Merging, a method that encompasses two principal stages: (1) modularizing knowledge into shared and exclusive components, with compression to reduce redundancy and enhance efficiency; (2) dynamically merging shared and task-specific knowledge based on the input. This approach narrows the performance gap between merged and fine-tuned models and improves adaptability to heterogeneous data. Extensive experiments on $12$ datasets for both discriminative and generative tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing an average improvement of $28.34\%$ in absolute normalized score for discriminative tasks and even surpassing the fine-tuned upper bound on the generative tasks.

      <title>On Giant's Shoulders: Effortless Weak to Strong by Dynamic Logits Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of large language models for task-specific applications is imperative, yet the vast number of parameters in these models makes their training increasingly challenging. Despite numerous proposals for effective methods, a substantial memory overhead remains for gradient computations during updates. \thm{Can we fine-tune a series of task-specific small models and transfer their knowledge directly to a much larger model without additional training?} In this paper, we explore weak-to-strong specialization using logit arithmetic, facilitating a direct answer to this question. Existing weak-to-strong methods often employ a static knowledge transfer ratio and a single small model for transferring complex knowledge, which leads to suboptimal performance. % To address this, To surmount these limitations, we propose a dynamic logit fusion approach that works with a series of task-specific small models, each specialized in a different task. This method adaptively allocates weights among these models at each decoding step, learning the weights through Kullback-Leibler divergence constrained optimization problems. We conduct extensive experiments across various benchmarks in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving leading results. By transferring expertise from the 7B model to the 13B model, our method closes the performance gap by 96.4\% in single-task scenarios and by 86.3\% in multi-task scenarios compared to full fine-tuning of the 13B model. Notably, we achieve surpassing performance on unseen tasks. Moreover, we further demonstrate that our method can effortlessly integrate in-context learning for single tasks and task arithmetic for multi-task scenarios.

      <title>JobFair: A Framework for Benchmarking Gender Hiring Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for benchmarking hierarchical gender hiring bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) for resume scoring, revealing significant issues of reverse bias and overdebiasing. Our contributions are fourfold: First, we introduce a framework using a real, anonymized resume dataset from the Healthcare, Finance, and Construction industries, meticulously used to avoid confounding factors. It evaluates gender hiring biases across hierarchical levels, including Level bias, Spread bias, Taste-based bias, and Statistical bias. This framework can be generalized to other social traits and tasks easily. Second, we propose novel statistical and computational hiring bias metrics based on a counterfactual approach, including Rank After Scoring (RAS), Rank-based Impact Ratio, Permutation Test-Based Metrics, and Fixed Effects Model-based Metrics. These metrics, rooted in labor economics, NLP, and law, enable holistic evaluation of hiring biases. Third, we analyze hiring biases in ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Six out of ten LLMs show significant biases against males in healthcare and finance. An industry-effect regression reveals that the healthcare industry is the most biased against males. GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 are the most biased models, showing significant bias in all three industries. Conversely, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama3-8b-Instruct, and Llama3-70b-Instruct are the least biased. The hiring bias of all LLMs, except for Llama3-8b-Instruct and Claude-3-Sonnet, remains consistent regardless of random expansion or reduction of resume content. Finally, we offer a user-friendly demo to facilitate adoption and practical application of the framework.</description>

      <title>Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support extremely long context windows, but the quadratic complexity of vanilla attention results in significantly long Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency. Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\times$ compared with FlashAttention.</description>

Abstract: Achieving General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) has long been a grand challenge in the field of AI, and brain-inspired computing is widely acknowledged as one of the most promising approaches to realize this goal. This paper introduces a novel brain-inspired AI framework, Orangutan. It simulates the structure and computational mechanisms of biological brains on multiple scales, encompassing multi-compartment neuron architectures, diverse synaptic connection modalities, neural microcircuits, cortical columns, and brain regions, as well as biochemical processes including facilitation, feedforward inhibition, short-term potentiation, and short-term depression, all grounded in solid neuroscience. Building upon these highly integrated brain-like mechanisms, I have developed a sensorimotor model that simulates human saccadic eye movements during object observation. The model's algorithmic efficacy was validated through testing with the observation of handwritten digit images.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery Inspired Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the task of emotion-cause pair extraction in the unsupervised domain adaptation setting. The problem is challenging as the distributions of the events causing emotions in target domains are dramatically different than those in source domains, despite the distributions of emotional expressions between domains are overlapped. Inspired by causal discovery, we propose a novel deep latent model in the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, which not only captures the underlying latent structures of data but also utilizes the easily transferable knowledge of emotions as the bridge to link the distributions of events in different domains. To facilitate knowledge transfer across domains, we also propose a novel variational posterior regularization technique to disentangle the latent representations of emotions from those of events in order to mitigate the damage caused by the spurious correlations related to the events in source domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the strongest baseline by approximately 11.05% on a Chinese benchmark and 2.45% on a English benchmark in terms of weighted-average F1 score. The source code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques applied to the problem of financial market forecasting struggle with dynamic regime switching, or underlying correlation and covariance shifts in true (hidden) market variables. Drawing inspiration from the success of reinforcement learning in robotics, particularly in agile locomotion adaptation of quadruped robots to unseen terrains, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages world knowledge of pretrained LLMs (aka. 'privileged information' in robotics) and dynamically adapts them using intrinsic, natural market rewards using LLM alignment technique we dub as "Reinforcement Learning from Market Feedback" (**RLMF**). Strong empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in adapting to regime shifts in financial markets, a challenge that has long plagued predictive models in this domain. The proposed algorithmic framework outperforms best-performing SOTA LLM models on the existing (FLARE) benchmark stock-movement (SM) tasks by more than 15\% improved accuracy. On the recently proposed NIFTY SM task, our adaptive policy outperforms the SOTA best performing trillion parameter models like GPT-4. The paper details the dual-phase, teacher-student architecture and implementation of our model, the empirical results obtained, and an analysis of the role of language embeddings in terms of Information Gain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) are promising for biomedical and healthcare research. Despite the availability of open-source LLMs trained using a wide range of biomedical data, current research on the applications of LLMs to genomics and proteomics is still limited. To fill this gap, we propose a collection of finetuned LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), known as Geneverse, for three novel tasks in genomic and proteomic research. The models in Geneverse are trained and evaluated based on domain-specific datasets, and we use advanced parameter-efficient finetuning techniques to achieve the model adaptation for tasks including the generation of descriptions for gene functions, protein function inference from its structure, and marker gene selection from spatial transcriptomic data. We demonstrate that adapted LLMs and MLLMs perform well for these tasks and may outperform closed-source large-scale models based on our evaluations focusing on both truthfulness and structural correctness. All of the training strategies and base models we used are freely accessible.</description>

      <title>R&amp;B -- Rhythm and Brain: Cross-subject Decoding of Music from Human Brain Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music is a universal phenomenon that profoundly influences human experiences across cultures. This study investigates whether music can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional MRI (fMRI) during its perception. Leveraging recent advancements in extensive datasets and pre-trained computational models, we construct mappings between neural data and latent representations of musical stimuli. Our approach integrates functional and anatomical alignment techniques to facilitate cross-subject decoding, addressing the challenges posed by the low temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in fMRI data. Starting from the GTZan fMRI dataset, where five participants listened to 540 musical stimuli from 10 different genres while their brain activity was recorded, we used the CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) model to extract latent representations of the musical stimuli and developed voxel-wise encoding models to identify brain regions responsive to these stimuli. By applying a threshold to the association between predicted and actual brain activity, we identified specific regions of interest (ROIs) which can be interpreted as key players in music processing. Our decoding pipeline, primarily retrieval-based, employs a linear map to project brain activity to the corresponding CLAP features. This enables us to predict and retrieve the musical stimuli most similar to those that originated the fMRI data. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art identification accuracy, with our methods significantly outperforming existing approaches. Our findings suggest that neural-based music retrieval systems could enable personalized recommendations and therapeutic applications. Future work could use higher temporal resolution neuroimaging and generative models to improve decoding accuracy and explore the neural underpinnings of music perception and emotion.</description>

      <title>SAIL: Self-Improving Efficient Online Alignment of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a key method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, current offline alignment approaches like DPO, IPO, and SLiC rely heavily on fixed preference datasets, which can lead to sub-optimal performance. On the other hand, recent literature has focused on designing online RLHF methods but still lacks a unified conceptual formulation and suffers from distribution shift issues. To address this, we establish that online LLM alignment is underpinned by bilevel optimization. By reducing this formulation to an efficient single-level first-order method (using the reward-policy equivalence), our approach generates new samples and iteratively refines model alignment by exploring responses and regulating preference labels. In doing so, we permit alignment methods to operate in an online and self-improving manner, as well as generalize prior online RLHF methods as special cases. Compared to state-of-the-art iterative RLHF methods, our approach significantly improves alignment performance on open-sourced datasets with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Sketch-GNN: Scalable Graph Neural Networks with Sublinear Training Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely applied to graph learning problems such as node classification. When scaling up the underlying graphs of GNNs to a larger size, we are forced to either train on the complete graph and keep the full graph adjacency and node embeddings in memory (which is often infeasible) or mini-batch sample the graph (which results in exponentially growing computational complexities with respect to the number of GNN layers). Various sampling-based and historical-embedding-based methods are proposed to avoid this exponential growth of complexities. However, none of these solutions eliminates the linear dependence on graph size. This paper proposes a sketch-based algorithm whose training time and memory grow sublinearly with respect to graph size by training GNNs atop a few compact sketches of graph adjacency and node embeddings. Based on polynomial tensor-sketch (PTS) theory, our framework provides a novel protocol for sketching non-linear activations and graph convolution matrices in GNNs, as opposed to existing methods that sketch linear weights or gradients in neural networks. In addition, we develop a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technique that can be trained to improve the quality of sketches. Experiments on large-graph benchmarks demonstrate the scalability and competitive performance of our Sketch-GNNs versus their full-size GNN counterparts.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Optimal Learning from Preferences with Hidden Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring AI models align with human values is essential for their safety and functionality. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) uses human preferences to achieve this alignment. However, preferences sourced from diverse populations can result in point estimates of human values that may be sub-optimal or unfair to specific groups. We propose Pareto Optimal Preference Learning (POPL), which frames discrepant group preferences as objectives with potential trade-offs, aiming for policies that are Pareto-optimal on the preference dataset. POPL utilizes Lexicase selection, an iterative process to select diverse and Pareto-optimal solutions. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that POPL surpasses baseline methods in learning sets of reward functions, effectively catering to distinct groups without access to group numbers or membership labels. Furthermore, we illustrate that POPL can serve as a foundation for techniques optimizing specific notions of group fairness, ensuring inclusive and equitable AI model alignment.</description>

      <title>Automated radiotherapy treatment planning guided by GPT-4Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning is a time-consuming and potentially subjective process that requires the iterative adjustment of model parameters to balance multiple conflicting objectives. Recent advancements in large foundation models offer promising avenues for addressing the challenges in planning and clinical decision-making. This study introduces GPT-RadPlan, a fully automated treatment planning framework that harnesses prior radiation oncology knowledge encoded in multi-modal large language models, such as GPT-4Vision (GPT-4V) from OpenAI. GPT-RadPlan is made aware of planning protocols as context and acts as an expert human planner, capable of guiding a treatment planning process. Via in-context learning, we incorporate clinical protocols for various disease sites as prompts to enable GPT-4V to acquire treatment planning domain knowledge. The resulting GPT-RadPlan agent is integrated into our in-house inverse treatment planning system through an API. The efficacy of the automated planning system is showcased using multiple prostate and head &amp; neck cancer cases, where we compared GPT-RadPlan results to clinical plans. In all cases, GPT-RadPlan either outperformed or matched the clinical plans, demonstrating superior target coverage and organ-at-risk sparing. Consistently satisfying the dosimetric objectives in the clinical protocol, GPT-RadPlan represents the first multimodal large language model agent that mimics the behaviors of human planners in radiation oncology clinics, achieving remarkable results in automating the treatment planning process without the need for additional training.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) methods for estimating the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of aircraft engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is aimed at using the newly developing field of physics informed machine learning (PIML) to develop models for predicting the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) aircraft engines. We consider the well-known benchmark NASA Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) data as the main data for this paper, which consists of sensor outputs in a variety of different operating modes. C-MAPSS is a well-studied dataset with much existing work in the literature that address RUL prediction with classical and deep learning methods. In the absence of published empirical physical laws governing the C-MAPSS data, our approach first uses stochastic methods to estimate the governing physics models from the noisy time series data. In our approach, we model the various sensor readings as being governed by stochastic differential equations, and we estimate the corresponding transition density mean and variance functions of the underlying processes. We then augment LSTM (long-short term memory) models with the learned mean and variance functions during training and inferencing. Our PIML based approach is different from previous methods, and we use the data to first learn the physics. Our results indicate that PIML discovery and solutions methods are well suited for this problem and outperform previous data-only deep learning methods for this data set and task. Moreover, the framework developed herein is flexible, and can be adapted to other situations (other sensor modalities or combined multi-physics environments), including cases where the underlying physics is only partially observed or known.</description>

      <title>Marrying Compressed Sensing and Deep Signal Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind signal separation (BSS) is an important and challenging signal processing task. Given an observed signal which is a superposition of a collection of unknown (hidden/latent) signals, BSS aims at recovering the separate, underlying signals from only the observed mixed signal. As an underdetermined problem, BSS is notoriously difficult to solve in general, and modern deep learning has provided engineers with an effective set of tools to solve this problem. For example, autoencoders learn a low-dimensional hidden encoding of the input data which can then be used to perform signal separation. In real-time systems, a common bottleneck is the transmission of data (communications) to a central command in order to await decisions. Bandwidth limits dictate the frequency and resolution of the data being transmitted. To overcome this, compressed sensing (CS) technology allows for the direct acquisition of compressed data with a near optimal reconstruction guarantee. This paper addresses the question: can compressive acquisition be combined with deep learning for BSS to provide a complete acquire-separate-predict pipeline? In other words, the aim is to perform BSS on a compressively acquired signal directly without ever having to decompress the signal. We consider image data (MNIST and E-MNIST) and show how our compressive autoencoder approach solves the problem of compressive BSS. We also provide some theoretical insights into the problem.</description>

      <title>Shortcomings of LLMs for Low-Resource Translation: Retrieval and Understanding are Both the Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the in-context learning abilities of pretrained large language models (LLMs) when instructed to translate text from a low-resource language into a high-resource language as part of an automated machine translation pipeline. We conduct a set of experiments translating Southern Quechua to Spanish and examine the informativity of various types of information retrieved from a constrained database of digitized pedagogical materials (dictionaries and grammar lessons) and parallel corpora. Using both automatic and human evaluation of model output, we conduct ablation studies that manipulate (1) context type (morpheme translations, grammar descriptions, and corpus examples), (2) retrieval methods (automated vs. manual), and (3) model type. Our results suggest that even relatively small LLMs are capable of utilizing prompt context for zero-shot low-resource translation when provided a minimally sufficient amount of relevant linguistic information. However, the variable effects of prompt type, retrieval method, model type, and language-specific factors highlight the limitations of using even the best LLMs as translation systems for the majority of the world's 7,000+ languages and their speakers.</description>

      <title>TorchSpatial: A Location Encoding Framework and Benchmark for Spatial Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial representation learning (SRL) aims at learning general-purpose neural network representations from various types of spatial data (e.g., points, polylines, polygons, networks, images, etc.) in their native formats. Learning good spatial representations is a fundamental problem for various downstream applications such as species distribution modeling, weather forecasting, trajectory generation, geographic question answering, etc. Even though SRL has become the foundation of almost all geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) research, we have not yet seen significant efforts to develop an extensive deep learning framework and benchmark to support SRL model development and evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose TorchSpatial, a learning framework and benchmark for location (point) encoding, which is one of the most fundamental data types of spatial representation learning. TorchSpatial contains three key components: 1) a unified location encoding framework that consolidates 15 commonly recognized location encoders, ensuring scalability and reproducibility of the implementations; 2) the LocBench benchmark tasks encompassing 7 geo-aware image classification and 4 geo-aware image regression datasets; 3) a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics to quantify geo-aware models' overall performance as well as their geographic bias, with a novel Geo-Bias Score metric. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and insights into the model performance and geographic bias of different location encoders. We believe TorchSpatial will foster future advancement of spatial representation learning and spatial fairness in GeoAI research. The TorchSpatial model framework, LocBench, and Geo-Bias Score evaluation framework are available at https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial.</description>

      <title>Matching Problems to Solutions: An Explainable Way of Solving Machine Learning Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain experts from all fields are called upon, working with data scientists, to explore the use of ML techniques to solve their problems. Starting from a domain problem/question, ML-based problem-solving typically involves three steps: (1) formulating the business problem (problem domain) as a data analysis problem (solution domain), (2) sketching a high-level ML-based solution pattern, given the domain requirements and the properties of the available data, and (3) designing and refining the different components of the solution pattern. There has to be a substantial body of ML problem solving knowledge that ML researchers agree on, and that ML practitioners routinely apply to solve the most common problems. Our work deals with capturing this body of knowledge, and embodying it in a ML problem solving workbench to helps domain specialists who are not ML experts to explore the ML solution space. This paper focuses on: 1) the representation of domain problems, ML problems, and the main ML solution artefacts, and 2) a heuristic matching function that helps identify the ML algorithm family that is most appropriate for the domain problem at hand, given the domain (expert) requirements, and the characteristics of the training data. We review related work and outline our strategy for validating the workbench</description>

      <title>Large Language Models have Intrinsic Self-Correction Ability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for their remarkable abilities in various natural language processing tasks, but they suffer from hallucinations that will cause performance degradation. One promising solution to improve the LLMs' performance is to ask LLMs to revise their answer after generation, a technique known as self-correction. Among the two types of self-correction, intrinsic self-correction is considered a promising direction because it does not utilize external knowledge. However, recent works doubt the validity of LLM's ability to conduct intrinsic self-correction. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on the intrinsic self-correction capabilities of LLMs through theoretical analyses and empirical experiments. In addition, we identify two critical factors for successful self-correction: zero temperature and fair prompts. Leveraging these factors, we demonstrate that intrinsic self-correction ability is exhibited across multiple existing LLMs. Our findings offer insights into the fundamental theories underlying the self-correction behavior of LLMs and remark on the importance of unbiased prompts and zero temperature settings in harnessing their full potential.</description>

      <title>Combining Neural Networks and Symbolic Regression for Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose CoNSAL (Combining Neural networks and Symbolic regression for Analytical Lyapunov function) to construct analytical Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamic systems. This framework contains a neural Lyapunov function and a symbolic regression component, where symbolic regression is applied to distill the neural network to precise analytical forms. Our approach utilizes symbolic regression not only as a tool for translation but also as a means to uncover counterexamples. This procedure terminates when no counterexamples are found in the analytical formulation. Compared with previous results, our algorithm directly produces an analytical form of the Lyapunov function with improved interpretability in both the learning process and the final results. We apply our algorithm to 2-D inverted pendulum, path following, Van Der Pol Oscillator, 3-D trig dynamics, 4-D rotating wheel pendulum, 6-D 3-bus power system, and demonstrate that our algorithm successfully finds their valid Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pluggable type systems allow programmers to extend the type system of a programming language to enforce semantic properties defined by the programmer. Pluggable type systems are difficult to deploy in legacy codebases because they require programmers to write type annotations manually. This paper investigates how to use machine learning to infer type qualifiers automatically. We propose a novel representation, NaP-AST, that encodes minimal dataflow hints for the effective inference of type qualifiers. We evaluate several model architectures for inferring type qualifiers, including Graph Transformer Network, Graph Convolutional Network and Large Language Model. We further validated these models by applying them to 12 open-source programs from a prior evaluation of the NullAway pluggable typechecker, lowering warnings in all but one unannotated project. We discovered that GTN shows the best performance, with a recall of .89 and precision of 0.6. Furthermore, we conduct a study to estimate the number of Java classes needed for good performance of the trained model. For our feasibility study, performance improved around 16k classes, and deteriorated due to overfitting around 22k classes.</description>

      <title>Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In automated pronunciation assessment, recent emphasis progressively lies on evaluating multiple aspects to provide enriched feedback. However, acquiring multi-aspect-score labeled data for non-native language learners' speech poses challenges; moreover, it often leads to score-imbalanced distributions. In this paper, we propose two Acoustic Feature Mixup strategies, linearly and non-linearly interpolating with the in-batch averaged feature, to address data scarcity and score-label imbalances. Primarily using goodness-of-pronunciation as an acoustic feature, we tailor mixup designs to suit pronunciation assessment. Further, we integrate fine-grained error-rate features by comparing speech recognition results with the original answer phonemes, giving direct hints for mispronunciation. Effective mixing of the acoustic features notably enhances overall scoring performances on the speechocean762 dataset, and detailed analysis highlights our potential to predict unseen distortions.</description>

      <title>Breaking Secure Aggregation: Label Leakage from Aggregated Gradients in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) exhibits privacy vulnerabilities under gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), which can extract private information from individual gradients. To enhance privacy, FL incorporates Secure Aggregation (SA) to prevent the server from obtaining individual gradients, thus effectively resisting GIAs. In this paper, we propose a stealthy label inference attack to bypass SA and recover individual clients' private labels. Specifically, we conduct a theoretical analysis of label inference from the aggregated gradients that are exclusively obtained after implementing SA. The analysis results reveal that the inputs (embeddings) and outputs (logits) of the final fully connected layer (FCL) contribute to gradient disaggregation and label restoration. To preset the embeddings and logits of FCL, we craft a fishing model by solely modifying the parameters of a single batch normalization (BN) layer in the original model. Distributing client-specific fishing models, the server can derive the individual gradients regarding the bias of FCL by resolving a linear system with expected embeddings and the aggregated gradients as coefficients. Then the labels of each client can be precisely computed based on preset logits and gradients of FCL's bias. Extensive experiments show that our attack achieves large-scale label recovery with 100\% accuracy on various datasets and model architectures.</description>

      <title>RankAdaptor: Hierarchical Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation for Structural Pruned LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient compression of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly popular. However, recovering the accuracy of compressed LLMs is still a major challenge. Structural pruning with standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a common technique in current LLM compression. In structural pruning, the model architecture is modified unevenly, resulting in suboptimal performance in various downstream tasks via standard LoRA with fixed rank. To address this problem, we introduce RankAdaptor, an efficient fine-tuning method with hierarchical dynamic rank scheduling for pruned LLMs. An end-to-end automatic optimization flow is developed that utilizes a lightweight performance model to determine the different ranks during fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that RankAdaptor consistently outperforms standard LoRA with structural pruning over different pruning settings. Without increasing the trainable parameters, RankAdaptor further reduces the accuracy performance gap between the recovery of the pruned model and the original model compared to standard LoRA.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Solving Conditional Image Leakage in Image-to-Video Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have obtained substantial progress in image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such models are not fully understood. In this paper, we report a significant but previously overlooked issue in I2V diffusion models (I2V-DMs), namely, conditional image leakage. I2V-DMs tend to over-rely on the conditional image at large time steps, neglecting the crucial task of predicting the clean video from noisy inputs, which results in videos lacking dynamic and vivid motion. We further address this challenge from both inference and training aspects by presenting plug-and-play strategies accordingly. First, we introduce a training-free inference strategy that starts the generation process from an earlier time step to avoid the unreliable late-time steps of I2V-DMs, as well as an initial noise distribution with optimal analytic expressions (Analytic-Init) by minimizing the KL divergence between it and the actual marginal distribution to effectively bridge the training-inference gap. Second, to mitigate conditional image leakage during training, we design a time-dependent noise distribution for the conditional image, which favors high noise levels at large time steps to sufficiently interfere with the conditional image. We validate these strategies on various I2V-DMs using our collected open-domain image benchmark and the UCF101 dataset. Extensive results demonstrate that our methods outperform baselines by producing videos with more dynamic and natural motion without compromising image alignment and temporal consistency.

      <title>Evaluating Large Vision-and-Language Models on Children's Mathematical Olympiads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant progress in the general-purpose problem solving abilities of large vision and language models (LVLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.; some of these breakthroughs even seem to enable AI models to outperform human abilities in varied tasks that demand higher-order cognitive skills. Are the current large AI models indeed capable of generalized problem solving as humans do? A systematic analysis of AI capabilities for joint vision and text reasoning, however, is missing in the current scientific literature. In this paper, we make an effort towards filling this gap, by evaluating state-of-the-art LVLMs on their mathematical and algorithmic reasoning abilities using visuo-linguistic problems from children's Olympiads. Specifically, we consider problems from the Mathematical Kangaroo (MK) Olympiad, which is a popular international competition targeted at children from grades 1-12, that tests children's deeper mathematical abilities using puzzles that are appropriately gauged to their age and skills. Using the puzzles from MK, we created a dataset, dubbed SMART-840, consisting of 840 problems from years 2020-2024. With our dataset, we analyze LVLMs power on mathematical reasoning; their responses on our puzzles offer a direct way to compare against that of children. Our results show that modern LVLMs do demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning skills in solving problems for higher grades, but lack the foundations to correctly answer problems designed for younger children. Further analysis shows that there is no significant correlation between the reasoning capabilities of AI models and that of young children, and their capabilities appear to be based on a different type of reasoning than the cumulative knowledge that underlies children's mathematics and logic skills.</description>

      <title>Ladder: A Model-Agnostic Framework Boosting LLM-based Machine Translation to the Next Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have achieved remarkable advancements in machine translation (MT) by leveraging extensive web content. On the other hand, translation-specific LLMs are built by pre-training on domain-specific monolingual corpora and fine-tuning with human-annotated translation data. Despite the superior performance, these methods either demand an unprecedented scale of computing and data or substantial human editing and annotation efforts. In this paper, we develop Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving Ladder's refining performance progressively. The trained Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their translation performance. By utilizing Gemma-2B/7B as the backbone, Ladder-2B can elevate raw translations to the level of top-tier open-source models (e.g., refining BigTranslate-13B with +6.91 BLEU and +3.52 COMET for XX-En), and Ladder-7B can further enhance model performance to be on par with the state-of-the-art GPT-4. Extensive ablation and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of Ladder in diverse settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/fzp0424/Ladder</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Programming with Programmable Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to the wide array of advanced Monte Carlo methods supported by modern probabilistic programming languages (PPLs), PPL support for variational inference (VI) is less developed: users are typically limited to a predefined selection of variational objectives and gradient estimators, which are implemented monolithically (and without formal correctness arguments) in PPL backends. In this paper, we propose a more modular approach to supporting variational inference in PPLs, based on compositional program transformation. In our approach, variational objectives are expressed as programs, that may employ first-class constructs for computing densities of and expected values under user-defined models and variational families. We then transform these programs systematically into unbiased gradient estimators for optimizing the objectives they define. Our design enables modular reasoning about many interacting concerns, including automatic differentiation, density accumulation, tracing, and the application of unbiased gradient estimation strategies. Additionally, relative to existing support for VI in PPLs, our design increases expressiveness along three axes: (1) it supports an open-ended set of user-defined variational objectives, rather than a fixed menu of options; (2) it supports a combinatorial space of gradient estimation strategies, many not automated by today's PPLs; and (3) it supports a broader class of models and variational families, because it supports constructs for approximate marginalization and normalization (previously introduced only for Monte Carlo inference). We implement our approach in an extension to the Gen probabilistic programming system (genjax.vi, implemented in JAX), and evaluate on several deep generative modeling tasks, showing minimal performance overhead vs. hand-coded implementations and performance competitive with well-established open-source PPLs.</description>

      <title>TacoLM: GaTed Attention Equipped Codec Language Model are Efficient Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural codec language model (LM) has demonstrated strong capability in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, the codec LM often suffers from limitations in inference speed and stability, due to its auto-regressive nature and implicit alignment between text and audio. In this work, to handle these challenges, we introduce a new variant of neural codec LM, namely TacoLM. Specifically, TacoLM introduces a gated attention mechanism to improve the training and inference efficiency and reduce the model size. Meanwhile, an additional gated cross-attention layer is included for each decoder layer, which improves the efficiency and content accuracy of the synthesized speech. In the evaluation of the Librispeech corpus, the proposed TacoLM achieves a better word error rate, speaker similarity, and mean opinion score, with 90% fewer parameters and 5.2 times speed up, compared with VALL-E. Demo and code is available at https://ereboas.github.io/TacoLM/.</description>

      <title>The Perils of Optimizing Learned Reward Functions: Low Training Error Does Not Guarantee Low Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, specifying reward functions that capture the intended task can be very challenging. Reward learning aims to address this issue by learning the reward function. However, a learned reward model may have a low error on the training distribution, and yet subsequently produce a policy with large regret. We say that such a reward model has an error-regret mismatch. The main source of an error-regret mismatch is the distributional shift that commonly occurs during policy optimization. In this paper, we mathematically show that a sufficiently low expected test error of the reward model guarantees low worst-case regret, but that for any fixed expected test error, there exist realistic data distributions that allow for error-regret mismatch to occur. We then show that similar problems persist even when using policy regularization techniques, commonly employed in methods such as RLHF. Our theoretical results highlight the importance of developing new ways to measure the quality of learned reward models.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Background Representation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating reliable pseudo masks from image-level labels is challenging in the weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) task due to the lack of spatial information. Prevalent class activation map (CAM)-based solutions are challenged to discriminate the foreground (FG) objects from the suspicious background (BG) pixels (a.k.a. co-occurring) and learn the integral object regions. This paper proposes a simple fine-grained background representation (FBR) method to discover and represent diverse BG semantics and address the co-occurring problems. We abandon using the class prototype or pixel-level features for BG representation. Instead, we develop a novel primitive, negative region of interest (NROI), to capture the fine-grained BG semantic information and conduct the pixel-to-NROI contrast to distinguish the confusing BG pixels. We also present an active sampling strategy to mine the FG negatives on-the-fly, enabling efficient pixel-to-pixel intra-foreground contrastive learning to activate the entire object region. Thanks to the simplicity of design and convenience in use, our proposed method can be seamlessly plugged into various models, yielding new state-of-the-art results under various WSSS settings across benchmarks. Leveraging solely image-level (I) labels as supervision, our method achieves 73.2 mIoU and 45.6 mIoU segmentation results on Pascal Voc and MS COCO test sets, respectively. Furthermore, by incorporating saliency maps as an additional supervision signal (I+S), we attain 74.9 mIoU on Pascal Voc test set. Concurrently, our FBR approach demonstrates meaningful performance gains in weakly-supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) tasks, showcasing its robustness and strong generalization capabilities across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>AllMatch: Exploiting All Unlabeled Data for Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing semi-supervised learning algorithms adopt pseudo-labeling and consistency regulation techniques to introduce supervision signals for unlabeled samples. To overcome the inherent limitation of threshold-based pseudo-labeling, prior studies have attempted to align the confidence threshold with the evolving learning status of the model, which is estimated through the predictions made on the unlabeled data. In this paper, we further reveal that classifier weights can reflect the differentiated learning status across categories and consequently propose a class-specific adaptive threshold mechanism. Additionally, considering that even the optimal threshold scheme cannot resolve the problem of discarding unlabeled samples, a binary classification consistency regulation approach is designed to distinguish candidate classes from negative options for all unlabeled samples. By combining the above strategies, we present a novel SSL algorithm named AllMatch, which achieves improved pseudo-label accuracy and a 100\% utilization ratio for the unlabeled data. We extensively evaluate our approach on multiple benchmarks, encompassing both balanced and imbalanced settings. The results demonstrate that AllMatch consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we present our champion solution for Ego4D EgoSchema Challenge in CVPR 2024. To deeply integrate the powerful egocentric captioning model and question reasoning model, we propose a novel Hierarchical Comprehension scheme for egocentric video Question Answering, named HCQA. It consists of three stages: Fine-grained Caption Generation, Context-driven Summarization, and Inference-guided Answering. Given a long-form video, HCQA captures local detailed visual information and global summarised visual information via Fine-grained Caption Generation and Context-driven Summarization, respectively. Then in Inference-guided Answering, HCQA utilizes this hierarchical information to reason and answer given question. On the EgoSchema blind test set, HCQA achieves 75% accuracy in answering over 5,000 human curated multiple-choice questions. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Hyu-Zhang/HCQA.</description>

Abstract: In this report, we present our approach for the Natural Language Query track and Goal Step track of the Ego4D Episodic Memory Benchmark at CVPR 2024. Both challenges require the localization of actions within long video sequences using textual queries. To enhance localization accuracy, our method not only processes the temporal information of videos but also identifies fine-grained objects spatially within the frames. To this end, we introduce a novel approach, termed ObjectNLQ, which incorporates an object branch to augment the video representation with detailed object information, thereby improving grounding efficiency. ObjectNLQ achieves a mean R@1 of 23.15, ranking 2nd in the Natural Language Queries Challenge, and gains 33.00 in terms of the metric R@1, IoU=0.3, ranking 3rd in the Goal Step Challenge. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Yisen-Feng/ObjectNLQ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising performance across various tasks. However, this scaling also introduces redundant structures, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Despite some recognition of redundancy in LLMs, the variability of redundancy across different structures, such as MLP and Attention layers, is under-explored. In this work, we investigate the varying redundancy across different modules within Transformers, including Blocks, MLP, and Attention layers, using a similarity-based metric. This metric operates on the premise that redundant structures produce outputs highly similar to their inputs. Surprisingly, while attention layers are essential for transformers and distinguish them from other mainstream architectures, we found that a large proportion of attention layers exhibit excessively high similarity and can be safely pruned without degrading performance, leading to reduced memory and computation costs. Additionally, we further propose a method that jointly drops Attention and MLP layers, achieving improved performance and dropping ratios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, e.g., Llama-3-70B maintains comparable performance even after pruning half of the attention layers. Our findings provide valuable insights for future network architecture design. The code will be released at: \url{https://github.com/Shwai-He/LLM-Drop}.</description>

      <title>Privacy Implications of Explainable AI in Data-Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models, demonstrably powerful, suffer from a lack of interpretability. The absence of transparency, often referred to as the black box nature of ML models, undermines trust and urges the need for efforts to enhance their explainability. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques address this challenge by providing frameworks and methods to explain the internal decision-making processes of these complex models. Techniques like Counterfactual Explanations (CF) and Feature Importance play a crucial role in achieving this goal. Furthermore, high-quality and diverse data remains the foundational element for robust and trustworthy ML applications. In many applications, the data used to train ML and XAI explainers contain sensitive information. In this context, numerous privacy-preserving techniques can be employed to safeguard sensitive information in the data, such as differential privacy. Subsequently, a conflict between XAI and privacy solutions emerges due to their opposing goals. Since XAI techniques provide reasoning for the model behavior, they reveal information relative to ML models, such as their decision boundaries, the values of features, or the gradients of deep learning models when explanations are exposed to a third entity. Attackers can initiate privacy breaching attacks using these explanations, to perform model extraction, inference, and membership attacks. This dilemma underscores the challenge of finding the right equilibrium between understanding ML decision-making and safeguarding privacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn cohesive and discriminative node representations for clustering has shown promising results in deep graph clustering. However, existing methods disregard the reciprocal relationship between representation learning and structure augmentation. This study suggests that enhancing embedding and structure synergistically becomes imperative for GNNs to unleash their potential in deep graph clustering. A reliable structure promotes obtaining more cohesive node representations, while high-quality node representations can guide the augmentation of the structure, enhancing structural reliability in return. Moreover, the generalization ability of existing GNNs-based models is relatively poor. While they perform well on graphs with high homogeneity, they perform poorly on graphs with low homogeneity. To this end, we propose a graph clustering framework named Synergistic Deep Graph Clustering Network (SynC). In our approach, we design a Transform Input Graph Auto-Encoder (TIGAE) to obtain high-quality embeddings for guiding structure augmentation. Then, we re-capture neighborhood representations on the augmented graph to obtain clustering-friendly embeddings and conduct self-supervised clustering. Notably, representation learning and structure augmentation share weights, significantly reducing the number of model parameters. Additionally, we introduce a structure fine-tuning strategy to improve the model's generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. The code is released on GitHub and Code Ocean.</description>

      <title>Understanding Student and Academic Staff Perceptions of AI Use in Assessment and Feedback</title>

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in higher education necessitates assessment reform. This study addresses a critical gap by exploring student and academic staff experiences with AI and GenAI tools, focusing on their familiarity and comfort with current and potential future applications in learning and assessment. An online survey collected data from 35 academic staff and 282 students across two universities in Vietnam and one in Singapore, examining GenAI familiarity, perceptions of its use in assessment marking and feedback, knowledge checking and participation, and experiences of GenAI text detection.
  Descriptive statistics and reflexive thematic analysis revealed a generally low familiarity with GenAI among both groups. GenAI feedback was viewed negatively; however, it was viewed more positively when combined with instructor feedback. Academic staff were more accepting of GenAI text detection tools and grade adjustments based on detection results compared to students. Qualitative analysis identified three themes: unclear understanding of text detection tools, variability in experiences with GenAI detectors, and mixed feelings about GenAI's future impact on educational assessment. These findings have major implications regarding the development of policies and practices for GenAI-enabled assessment and feedback in higher education.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Transformers with Centralized Aggregation are Sample-Efficient Multi-Agent World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning a world model for model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can significantly improve the sample efficiency by learning policies in imagination. However, building a world model for Multi-Agent RL (MARL) can be particularly challenging due to the scalability issue in a centralized architecture arising from a large number of agents, and also the non-stationarity issue in a decentralized architecture stemming from the inter-dependency among agents. To address both challenges, we propose a novel world model for MARL that learns decentralized local dynamics for scalability, combined with a centralized representation aggregation from all agents. We cast the dynamics learning as an auto-regressive sequence modeling problem over discrete tokens by leveraging the expressive Transformer architecture, in order to model complex local dynamics across different agents and provide accurate and consistent long-term imaginations. As the first pioneering Transformer-based world model for multi-agent systems, we introduce a Perceiver Transformer as an effective solution to enable centralized representation aggregation within this context. Results on Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) show that it outperforms strong model-free approaches and existing model-based methods in both sample efficiency and overall performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Solar Driver Forecasting with Multivariate Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a comprehensive framework for F10.7, S10.7, M10.7, and Y10.7 solar driver forecasting with a time series Transformer (PatchTST). To ensure an equal representation of high and low levels of solar activity, we construct a custom loss function to weight samples based on the distance between the solar driver's historical distribution and the training set. The solar driver forecasting framework includes an 18-day lookback window and forecasts 6 days into the future. When benchmarked against the Space Environment Technologies (SET) dataset, our model consistently produces forecasts with a lower standard mean error in nearly all cases, with improved prediction accuracy during periods of high solar activity. All the code is available on Github https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/sw-driver-forecaster.</description>

      <title>Learning Abstract World Model for Value-preserving Planning with Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose agents require fine-grained controls and rich sensory inputs to perform a wide range of tasks. However, this complexity often leads to intractable decision-making. Traditionally, agents are provided with task-specific action and observation spaces to mitigate this challenge, but this reduces autonomy. Instead, agents must be capable of building state-action spaces at the correct abstraction level from their sensorimotor experiences. We leverage the structure of a given set of temporally-extended actions to learn abstract Markov decision processes (MDPs) that operate at a higher level of temporal and state granularity. We characterize state abstractions necessary to ensure that planning with these skills, by simulating trajectories in the abstract MDP, results in policies with bounded value loss in the original MDP. We evaluate our approach in goal-based navigation environments that require continuous abstract states to plan successfully and show that abstract model learning improves the sample efficiency of planning and learning.</description>

      <title>Next Level Message-Passing with Hierarchical Support Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are extensively employed in graph learning tasks but suffer from limitations such as the restricted scope of information exchange, by being confined to neighboring nodes during each round of message passing. Various strategies have been proposed to address these limitations, including incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate global information exchange. In this study, we introduce the Hierarchical Support Graph (HSG), an extension of the virtual node concept created through recursive coarsening of the original graph. This approach provides a flexible framework for enhancing information flow in graphs, independent of the specific MPNN layers utilized. We present a theoretical analysis of HSGs, investigate their empirical performance, and demonstrate that HSGs can surpass other methods augmented with virtual nodes, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Explanations: Unraveling Recommendations Through Subgraph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in enhancing user experiences across various web applications by analyzing the complicated relationships between users and items. Knowledge graphs(KGs) have been widely used to enhance the performance of recommender systems. However, KGs are known to be noisy and incomplete, which are hard to provide reliable explanations for recommendation results. An explainable recommender system is crucial for the product development and subsequent decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel recommender that synergies Large Language Models (LLMs) and KGs to enhance the recommendation and provide interpretable results. Specifically, we first harness the power of LLMs to augment KG reconstruction. LLMs comprehend and decompose user reviews into new triples that are added into KG. In this way, we can enrich KGs with explainable paths that express user preferences. To enhance the recommendation on augmented KGs, we introduce a novel subgraph reasoning module that effectively measures the importance of nodes and discovers reasoning for recommendation. Finally, these reasoning paths are fed into the LLMs to generate interpretable explanations of the recommendation results. Our approach significantly enhances both the effectiveness and interpretability of recommender systems, especially in cross-selling scenarios where traditional methods falter. The effectiveness of our approach has been rigorously tested on four open real-world datasets, with our methods demonstrating a superior performance over contemporary state-of-the-art techniques by an average improvement of 12%. The application of our model in a multinational engineering and technology company cross-selling recommendation system further underscores its practical utility and potential to redefine recommendation practices through improved accuracy and user trust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, the detection of AI-generated content is receiving more and more attention. Our idea is to go beyond detection and try to recover the prompt used to generate a text. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, introduces the first investigation in this particular domain without a closed set of tasks. Our goal is to study if this approach is promising. We experiment with zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning but also with LoRA fine-tuning. After that, we evaluate the benefits of using a semi-synthetic dataset. For this first study, we limit ourselves to text generated by a single model. The results show that it is possible to recover the original prompt with a reasonable degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>AI-based Drone Assisted Human Rescue in Disaster Environments: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey we are focusing on utilizing drone-based systems for the detection of individuals, particularly by identifying human screams and other distress signals. This study has significant relevance in post-disaster scenarios, including events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, military conflicts, wildfires, and more. These drones are capable of hovering over disaster-stricken areas that may be challenging for rescue teams to access directly. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, are frequently deployed for search-and-rescue missions during disaster situations. Typically, drones capture aerial images to assess structural damage and identify the extent of the disaster. They also employ thermal imaging technology to detect body heat signatures, which can help locate individuals. In some cases, larger drones are used to deliver essential supplies to people stranded in isolated disaster-stricken areas. In our discussions, we delve into the unique challenges associated with locating humans through aerial acoustics. The auditory system must distinguish between human cries and sounds that occur naturally, such as animal calls and wind. Additionally, it should be capable of recognizing distinct patterns related to signals like shouting, clapping, or other ways in which people attempt to signal rescue teams. To tackle this challenge, one solution involves harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze sound frequencies and identify common audio signatures. Deep learning-based networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be trained using these signatures to filter out noise generated by drone motors and other environmental factors. Furthermore, employing signal processing techniques like the direction of arrival (DOA) based on microphone array signals can enhance the precision of tracking the source of human noises.</description>

      <title>BigCodeBench: Benchmarking Code Generation with Diverse Function Calls and Complex Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated software engineering has been greatly empowered by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for programming. While current benchmarks have shown that LLMs can perform various software engineering tasks like human developers, the majority of their evaluations are limited to short and self-contained algorithmic tasks. Solving challenging and practical programming tasks requires the capability of utilizing diverse function calls as tools to efficiently implement functionalities like data analysis and web development. In addition, using multiple tools to solve a task needs compositional reasoning by accurately understanding complex instructions. Fulfilling both of these characteristics can pose a great challenge for LLMs. To assess how well LLMs can solve challenging and practical programming tasks, we introduce Bench, a benchmark that challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools from 139 libraries and 7 domains for 1,140 fine-grained programming tasks. To evaluate LLMs rigorously, each programming task encompasses 5.6 test cases with an average branch coverage of 99%. In addition, we propose a natural-language-oriented variant of Bench, Benchi, that automatically transforms the original docstrings into short instructions only with essential information. Our extensive evaluation of 60 LLMs shows that LLMs are not yet capable of following complex instructions to use function calls precisely, with scores up to 60%, significantly lower than the human performance of 97%. The results underscore the need for further advancements in this area.</description>

      <title>Fast Tree-Field Integrators: From Low Displacement Rank to Topological Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of fast polylog-linear algorithms based on the theory of structured matrices (in particular low displacement rank) for integrating tensor fields defined on weighted trees. Several applications of the resulting fast tree-field integrators (FTFIs) are presented, including (a) approximation of graph metrics with tree metrics, (b) graph classification, (c) modeling on meshes, and finally (d) Topological Transformers (TTs) (Choromanski et al., 2022) for images. For Topological Transformers, we propose new relative position encoding (RPE) masking mechanisms with as few as three extra learnable parameters per Transformer layer, leading to 1.0-1.5%+ accuracy gains. Importantly, most of FTFIs are exact methods, thus numerically equivalent to their brute-force counterparts. When applied to graphs with thousands of nodes, those exact algorithms provide 5.7-13x speedups. We also provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our methods.</description>

Abstract: Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) have emerged as an effective approach for scaling large language models while keeping a constant computational cost. Regardless of several notable successes of SMoE, effective training such architecture remains elusive due to the representation collapse problem, which in turn harms model performance and causes parameter redundancy. In this work, we present Similarity-based Sparse Mixture of Experts (SimSMoE), a novel similarity of neural network algorithm, that guarantees a solution to address the representation collapse issue between experts given a fixed FLOPs budget. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations on three large language models for both Pre-training and Fine-tuning tasks to illustrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of our method. The results demonstrate that SimSMoE significantly enhances existing routing policy and outperforms other SMoE training methods in performance for the tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmark plays a pivotal role in assessing the advancements of large language models (LLMs). While numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities, there is a notable absence of a dedicated benchmark for assessing their musical abilities. To address this gap, we present ZIQI-Eval, a comprehensive and large-scale music benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the music-related capabilities of LLMs. ZIQI-Eval encompasses a wide range of questions, covering 10 major categories and 56 subcategories, resulting in over 14,000 meticulously curated data entries. By leveraging ZIQI-Eval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation over 16 LLMs to evaluate and analyze LLMs' performance in the domain of music. Results indicate that all LLMs perform poorly on the ZIQI-Eval benchmark, suggesting significant room for improvement in their musical capabilities. With ZIQI-Eval, we aim to provide a standardized and robust evaluation framework that facilitates a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' music-related abilities. The dataset is available at GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/zcli-charlie/ZIQI-Eval} and HuggingFace\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/MYTH-Lab/ZIQI-Eval}.</description>

Abstract: In doctor-patient conversations, identifying medically relevant information is crucial, posing the need for conversation summarization. In this work, we propose the first deployable real-time speech summarization system for real-world applications in industry, which generates a local summary after every N speech utterances within a conversation and a global summary after the end of a conversation. Our system could enhance user experience from a business standpoint, while also reducing computational costs from a technical perspective. Secondly, we present VietMed-Sum which, to our knowledge, is the first speech summarization dataset for medical conversations. Thirdly, we are the first to utilize LLM and human annotators collaboratively to create gold standard and synthetic summaries for medical conversation summarization. Finally, we present baseline results of state-of-the-art models on VietMed-Sum.

Abstract: Recent research has shown the potential of Nash Learning via Human Feedback for large language model alignment by incorporating the notion of a preference model in a minimax game setup. We take this idea further by casting the alignment as a mirror descent algorithm against the adaptive feedback of an improved opponent, thereby removing the need for learning a preference model or the existence of an annotated dataset altogether. The resulting algorithm, which we refer to as Language Alignment via Nash-learning and Adaptive feedback (LANA), is capable of self-alignment without the need for a human-annotated preference dataset. We support this statement with various experiments and mathematical discussion.</description>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising tool for optical network optimization. However, the flexibility and efficiency of current DRL-based solutions for optical network optimization require further improvement. Currently, generative models have showcased their significant performance advantages across various domains. In this paper, we introduce OpticGAI, the AI-generated policy design paradigm for optical networks. In detail, it is implemented as a novel DRL framework that utilizes generative models to learn the optimal policy network. Furthermore, we assess the performance of OpticGAI on two NP-hard optical network problems, Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) and dynamic Routing, Modulation, and Spectrum Allocation (RMSA), to show the feasibility of the AI-generated policy paradigm. Simulation results have shown that OpticGAI achieves the highest reward and the lowest blocking rate of both RWA and RMSA problems. OpticGAI poses a promising direction for future research on generative AI-enhanced flexible optical network optimization.</description>

      <title>SEDMamba: Enhancing Selective State Space Modelling with Bottleneck Mechanism and Fine-to-Coarse Temporal Fusion for Efficient Error Detection in Robot-Assisted Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated detection of surgical errors can improve robotic-assisted surgery. Despite promising progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing rich temporal context to establish long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model named SEDMamba, which incorporates the selective state space model (SSM) into surgical error detection, facilitating efficient long sequence modelling with linear complexity. SEDMamba enhances selective SSM with bottleneck mechanism and fine-to-coarse temporal fusion (FCTF) to detect and temporally localize surgical errors in long videos. The bottleneck mechanism compresses and restores features within their spatial dimension, thereby reducing computational complexity. FCTF utilizes multiple dilated 1D convolutional layers to merge temporal information across diverse scale ranges, accommodating errors of varying durations. Besides, we deploy an established observational clinical human reliability assessment tool (OCHRA) to annotate the errors of suturing tasks in an open-source radical prostatectomy dataset (SAR-RARP50), constructing the first frame-level in-vivo surgical error detection dataset to support error detection in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SEDMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with at least 1.82% AUC and 3.80% AP performance gain with significantly reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Semantic Entropy Probes: Robust and Cheap Hallucination Detection in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose semantic entropy probes (SEPs), a cheap and reliable method for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs). Hallucinations, which are plausible-sounding but factually incorrect and arbitrary model generations, present a major challenge to the practical adoption of LLMs. Recent work by Farquhar et al. (2024) proposes semantic entropy (SE), which can detect hallucinations by estimating uncertainty in the space semantic meaning for a set of model generations. However, the 5-to-10-fold increase in computation cost associated with SE computation hinders practical adoption. To address this, we propose SEPs, which directly approximate SE from the hidden states of a single generation. SEPs are simple to train and do not require sampling multiple model generations at test time, reducing the overhead of semantic uncertainty quantification to almost zero. We show that SEPs retain high performance for hallucination detection and generalize better to out-of-distribution data than previous probing methods that directly predict model accuracy. Our results across models and tasks suggest that model hidden states capture SE, and our ablation studies give further insights into the token positions and model layers for which this is the case.</description>

      <title>An Automated SQL Query Grading System Using An Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grading SQL queries can be a time-consuming, tedious and challenging task, especially as the number of student submissions increases. Several systems have been introduced in an attempt to mitigate these challenges, but those systems have their own limitations. This paper describes our novel approach to automating the process of grading SQL queries. Unlike previous approaches, we employ a unique convolutional neural network architecture that employs a parameter-sharing approach for different machine learning tasks that enables the architecture to induce different knowledge representations of the data to increase its potential for understanding SQL statements.</description>

      <title>RuleR: Improving LLM Controllability by Rule-based Data Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still lack delicate controllability over their responses, which is critical to enhancing their performance and the user experience. However, curating supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets to improve LLM controllability usually relies on human experts or proprietary LLMs, which requires additional costs. To bridge this gap, we propose Rule-based Data Recycling (RuleR), a data augmentation method incorporating multiple constraints into the original data samples according to predefined rules, which creates new training tasks to consolidate the controllability of LLMs. Instead of creating new data from scratch, RuleR ``recycles'' existing data by simply applying rule-based edits to their responses and appending the rule-instructions in their original instructions. Experimental results demonstrate RuleR's effectiveness in improving LLM controllability while maintaining general instruction-following capabilities. The code will be released on https://github.com/MingLiiii/RuleR.</description>

      <title>Beyond Individual Facts: Investigating Categorical Knowledge Locality of Taxonomy and Meronomy Concepts in GPT Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The location of knowledge within Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-like models has seen extensive recent investigation. However, much of the work is focused towards determining locations of individual facts, with the end goal being the editing of facts that are outdated, erroneous, or otherwise harmful, without the time and expense of retraining the entire model. In this work, we investigate a broader view of knowledge location, that of concepts or clusters of related information, instead of disparate individual facts. To do this, we first curate a novel dataset, called DARC, that includes a total of 34 concepts of ~120K factual statements divided into two types of hierarchical categories, namely taxonomy and meronomy. Next, we utilize existing causal mediation analysis methods developed for determining regions of importance for individual facts and apply them to a series of related categories to provide detailed investigation into whether concepts are associated with distinct regions within these models. We find that related categories exhibit similar areas of importance in contrast to less similar categories. However, fine-grained localization of individual category subsets to specific regions is not apparent.</description>

      <title>LaneSegNet Design Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for computer vision algorithms to accurately assess road features in real-time. This study explores the LaneSegNet architecture, a new approach to lane topology prediction which integrates topological information with lane-line data to provide a more contextual understanding of road environments. The LaneSegNet architecture includes a feature extractor, lane encoder, lane decoder, and prediction head, leveraging components from ResNet-50, BEVFormer, and various attention mechanisms. We experimented with optimizations to the LaneSegNet architecture through feature extractor modification and transformer encoder-decoder stack modification. We found that modifying the encoder and decoder stacks offered an interesting tradeoff between training time and prediction accuracy, with certain combinations showing promising results. Our implementation, trained on a single NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPU, found that a 2:4 ratio reduced training time by 22.3% with only a 7.1% drop in mean average precision, while a 4:8 ratio increased training time by only 11.1% but improved mean average precision by a significant 23.7%. These results indicate that strategic hyperparameter tuning can yield substantial improvements depending on the resources of the user. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing LaneSegNet according to available computation power, making it more accessible for users with limited resources and increasing the capabilities for users with more powerful resources.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Doors of Perception: Vision Transformers Represent Relations Between Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of settings, they exhibit surprising failures when performing tasks involving visual relations. This begs the question: how do ViTs attempt to perform tasks that require computing visual relations between objects? Prior efforts to interpret ViTs tend to focus on characterizing relevant low-level visual features. In contrast, we adopt methods from mechanistic interpretability to study the higher-level visual algorithms that ViTs use to perform abstract visual reasoning. We present a case study of a fundamental, yet surprisingly difficult, relational reasoning task: judging whether two visual entities are the same or different. We find that pretrained ViTs fine-tuned on this task often exhibit two qualitatively different stages of processing despite having no obvious inductive biases to do so: 1) a perceptual stage wherein local object features are extracted and stored in a disentangled representation, and 2) a relational stage wherein object representations are compared. In the second stage, we find evidence that ViTs can learn to represent somewhat abstract visual relations, a capability that has long been considered out of reach for artificial neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate that failure points at either stage can prevent a model from learning a generalizable solution to our fairly simple tasks. By understanding ViTs in terms of discrete processing stages, one can more precisely diagnose and rectify shortcomings of existing and future models.</description>

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning and operations research. Therefore, given the fact that fairness considerations have become of paramount importance in algorithm design, fairness in clustering has received significant attention from the research community. The literature on fair clustering has resulted in a collection of interesting fairness notions and elaborate algorithms. In this paper, we take a critical view of fair clustering, identifying a collection of ignored issues such as the lack of a clear utility characterization and the difficulty in accounting for the downstream effects of a fair clustering algorithm in machine learning settings. In some cases, we demonstrate examples where the application of a fair clustering algorithm can have significant negative impacts on social welfare. We end by identifying a collection of steps that would lead towards more impactful research in fair clustering.</description>

      <title>Automating Transfer of Robot Task Plans using Functorial Data Migrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to ontology-based robot plan transfer using functorial data migrations from category theory. Functors provide structured maps between domain types and predicates which can be used to transfer plans from a source domain to a target domain without the need for replanning. Unlike methods that create models for transferring specific plans, our approach can be applied to any plan within a given domain. We demonstrate this approach by transferring a task plan from the canonical Blocksworld domain to one compatible with the AI2-THOR Kitchen environment. In addition, we discuss practical applications that may enhance the adaptability of robotic task planning in general.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Foundational Models for Q&amp;A Classification in Mental Health care</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have the potential to transform mental health support by providing accessible and culturally sensitive resources. However, despite this potential, their effectiveness in mental health care and specifically for the Arabic language has not been extensively explored. To bridge this gap, this study evaluates the effectiveness of foundational models for classification of Questions and Answers (Q&amp;A) in the domain of mental health care. We leverage the MentalQA dataset, an Arabic collection featuring Q&amp;A interactions related to mental health. In this study, we conducted experiments using four different types of learning approaches: traditional feature extraction, PLMs as feature extractors, Fine-tuning PLMs and prompting large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in zero-shot and few-shot learning settings. While traditional feature extractors combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM) showed promising performance, PLMs exhibited even better results due to their ability to capture semantic meaning. For example, MARBERT achieved the highest performance with a Jaccard Score of 0.80 for question classification and a Jaccard Score of 0.86 for answer classification. We further conducted an in-depth analysis including examining the effects of fine-tuning versus non-fine-tuning, the impact of varying data size, and conducting error analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that fine-tuning proved to be beneficial for enhancing the performance of PLMs, and the size of the training data played a crucial role in achieving high performance. We also explored prompting, where few-shot learning with GPT-3.5 yielded promising results. There was an improvement of 12% for question and classification and 45% for answer classification. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that PLMs and prompt-based approaches hold promise for mental health support in Arabic.</description>

      <title>Imperfect-Recall Games: Equilibrium Concepts and Their Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate optimal decision making under imperfect recall, that is, when an agent forgets information it once held before. An example is the absentminded driver game, as well as team games in which the members have limited communication capabilities. In the framework of extensive-form games with imperfect recall, we analyze the computational complexities of finding equilibria in multiplayer settings across three different solution concepts: Nash, multiselves based on evidential decision theory (EDT), and multiselves based on causal decision theory (CDT). We are interested in both exact and approximate solution computation. As special cases, we consider (1) single-player games, (2) two-player zero-sum games and relationships to maximin values, and (3) games without exogenous stochasticity (chance nodes). We relate these problems to the complexity classes P, PPAD, PLS, $\Sigma_2^P$ , $\exists$R, and $\exists \forall$R.</description>

      <title>Learning with Noisy Ground Truth: From 2D Classification to 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks has been highly successful in data-intense computer vision applications, while such success relies heavily on the massive and clean data. In real-world scenarios, clean data sometimes is difficult to obtain. For example, in image classification and segmentation tasks, precise annotations of millions samples are generally very expensive and time-consuming. In 3D static scene reconstruction task, most NeRF related methods require the foundational assumption of the static scene (e.g. consistent lighting condition and persistent object positions), which is often violated in real-world scenarios. To address these problem, learning with noisy ground truth (LNGT) has emerged as an effective learning method and shows great potential. In this short survey, we propose a formal definition unify the analysis of LNGT LNGT in the context of different machine learning tasks (classification and regression). Based on this definition, we propose a novel taxonomy to classify the existing work according to the error decomposition with the fundamental definition of machine learning. Further, we provide in-depth analysis on memorization effect and insightful discussion about potential future research opportunities from 2D classification to 3D reconstruction, in the hope of providing guidance to follow-up research.</description>

      <title>Deep-MPC: A DAGGER-Driven Imitation Learning Strategy for Optimal Constrained Battery Charging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of battery charging, several complex aspects demand meticulous attention, including thermal management, capacity degradation, and the need for rapid charging while maintaining safety and battery lifespan. By employing the imitation learning paradigm, this manuscript introduces an innovative solution to confront the inherent challenges often associated with conventional predictive control strategies for constrained battery charging. A significant contribution of this study lies in the adaptation of the Dataset Aggregation (DAGGER) algorithm to address scenarios where battery parameters are uncertain, and internal states are unobservable. Results drawn from a practical battery simulator that incorporates an electrochemical model highlight substantial improvements in battery charging performance, particularly in meeting all safety constraints and outperforming traditional strategies in computational processing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution by Discourse Structure and Semantic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing cross-document event coreference resolution models, which either compute mention similarity directly or enhance mention representation by extracting event arguments (such as location, time, agent, and patient), lacking the ability to utilize document-level information. As a result, they struggle to capture long-distance dependencies. This shortcoming leads to their underwhelming performance in determining coreference for the events where their argument information relies on long-distance dependencies. In light of these limitations, we propose the construction of document-level Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) trees and cross-document Lexical Chains to model the structural and semantic information of documents. Subsequently, cross-document heterogeneous graphs are constructed and GAT is utilized to learn the representations of events. Finally, a pair scorer calculates the similarity between each pair of events and co-referred events can be recognized using standard clustering algorithm. Additionally, as the existing cross-document event coreference datasets are limited to English, we have developed a large-scale Chinese cross-document event coreference dataset to fill this gap, which comprises 53,066 event mentions and 4,476 clusters. After applying our model on the English and Chinese datasets respectively, it outperforms all baselines by large margins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training data plays a pivotal role in AI models. Large language models (LLMs) are trained with massive amounts of documents, and their parameters hold document-related contents. Recently, several studies identified content-specific locations in LLMs by examining the parameters. Instead of the post hoc interpretation, we propose another approach. We propose document-wise memory architecture to track document memories in training. The proposed architecture maps document representations to memory entries, which softly mask memories in the forward process of LLMs. Additionally, we propose document guidance loss, which increases the likelihood of text with document memories and reduces the likelihood of the text with the memories of other documents. Experimental results on Wikitext-103-v1 with Pythia-1B show that the proposed methods provide different memory entries for documents and high recall of document-related content in generation with trained document-wise memories.</description>

Abstract: Current automatic depression detection systems provide predictions directly without relying on the individual symptoms/items of depression as denoted in the clinical depression rating scales. In contrast, clinicians assess each item in the depression rating scale in a clinical setting, thus implicitly providing a more detailed rationale for a depression diagnosis. In this work, we make a first step towards using the acoustic features of speech to predict individual items of the depression rating scale before obtaining the final depression prediction. For this, we use convolutional (CNN) and recurrent (long short-term memory (LSTM)) neural networks. We consider different approaches to learning the temporal context of speech. Further, we analyze two variants of voting schemes for individual item prediction and depression detection. We also include an animated visualization that shows an example of item prediction over time as the speech progresses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In model-based reinforcement learning, simulated experiences from the learned model are often treated as equivalent to experience from the real environment. However, when the model is inaccurate, it can catastrophically interfere with policy learning. Alternatively, the agent might learn about the model's accuracy and selectively use it only when it can provide reliable predictions. We empirically explore model uncertainty measures for selective planning and show that best results require distribution insensitive inference to estimate the uncertainty over model-based updates. To that end, we propose and evaluate bounding-box inference, which operates on bounding-boxes around sets of possible states and other quantities. We find that bounding-box inference can reliably support effective selective planning.</description>

      <title>Found in the Middle: Calibrating Positional Attention Bias Improves Long Context Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), even when specifically trained to process long input contexts, struggle to capture relevant information located in the middle of their input. This phenomenon has been known as the lost-in-the-middle problem. In this work, we make three contributions. First, we set out to understand the factors that cause this phenomenon. In doing so, we establish a connection between lost-in-the-middle to LLMs' intrinsic attention bias: LLMs exhibit a U-shaped attention bias where the tokens at the beginning and at the end of its input receive higher attention, regardless of their relevance. Second, we mitigate this positional bias through a calibration mechanism, found-in-the-middle, that allows the model to attend to contexts faithfully according to their relevance, even though when they are in the middle. Third, we show found-in-the-middle not only achieves better performance in locating relevant information within a long context, but also eventually leads to improved retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) performance across various tasks, outperforming existing methods by up to 15 percentage points. These findings open up future directions in understanding LLM attention bias and its potential consequences.</description>

      <title>Database-Augmented Query Representation for Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval models that aim to search for the documents relevant to the given query have shown many successes, which have been applied to diverse tasks. However, the query provided by the user is oftentimes very short, which challenges the retrievers to correctly fetch relevant documents. To tackle this, existing studies have proposed expanding the query with a couple of additional (user-related) features related to the query. Yet, they may be suboptimal to effectively augment the query, though there is plenty of information available to augment it in a relational database. Motivated by this, we present a novel retrieval framework called Database-Augmented Query representation (DAQu), which augments the original query with various (query-related) metadata across multiple tables. In addition, as the number of features in the metadata can be very large and there is no order among them, we encode them with our graph-based set encoding strategy, which considers hierarchies of features in the database without order. We validate DAQu in diverse retrieval scenarios that can incorporate metadata from the relational database, demonstrating that ours significantly enhances overall retrieval performance, compared to existing query augmentation methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grover search algorithm is a pivotal advancement in quantum computing, promising a remarkable speedup over classical algorithms in searching unstructured large databases. Here, we report results for the implementation and characterization of a three-qubit Grover search algorithm using the state-of-the-art scalable quantum computing technology of superconducting quantum architectures. To delve into the algorithm's scalability and performance metrics, our investigation spans the execution of the algorithm across all eight conceivable single-result oracles, alongside nine two-result oracles, employing IBM Quantum's 127-qubit quantum computers. Moreover, we conduct five quantum state tomography experiments to precisely gauge the behavior and efficiency of our implemented algorithm under diverse conditions; ranging from noisy, noise-free environments to the complexities of real-world quantum hardware. By connecting theoretical concepts with real-world experiments, this study not only shed light on the potential of NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) computers in facilitating large-scale database searches but also offer valuable insights into the practical application of the Grover search algorithm in real-world quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Events from Multiple Sources: Towards a Cross-Document Event Extraction Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document-level event extraction aims to extract structured event information from unstructured text. However, a single document often contains limited event information and the roles of different event arguments may be biased due to the influence of the information source. This paper addresses the limitations of traditional document-level event extraction by proposing the task of cross-document event extraction (CDEE) to integrate event information from multiple documents and provide a comprehensive perspective on events. We construct a novel cross-document event extraction dataset, namely CLES, which contains 20,059 documents and 37,688 mention-level events, where over 70% of them are cross-document. To build a benchmark, we propose a CDEE pipeline that includes 5 steps, namely event extraction, coreference resolution, entity normalization, role normalization and entity-role resolution. Our CDEE pipeline achieves about 72% F1 in end-to-end cross-document event extraction, suggesting the challenge of this task. Our work builds a new line of information extraction research and will attract new research attention.</description>

      <title>TimeAutoDiff: Combining Autoencoder and Diffusion model for time series tabular data synthesizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage the power of latent diffusion models to generate synthetic time series tabular data. Along with the temporal and feature correlations, the heterogeneous nature of the feature in the table has been one of the main obstacles in time series tabular data modeling. We tackle this problem by combining the ideas of the variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Our model named as \texttt{TimeAutoDiff} has several key advantages including (1) Generality: the ability to handle the broad spectrum of time series tabular data from single to multi-sequence datasets; (2) Good fidelity and utility guarantees: numerical experiments on six publicly available datasets demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in generating time series tabular data, across four metrics measuring fidelity and utility; (3) Fast sampling speed: entire time series data generation as opposed to the sequential data sampling schemes implemented in the existing diffusion-based models, eventually leading to significant improvements in sampling speed, (4) Entity conditional generation: the first implementation of conditional generation of multi-sequence time series tabular data with heterogenous features in the literature, enabling scenario exploration across multiple scientific and engineering domains. Codes are in preparation for release to the public, but available upon request.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing zero-shot cross-lingual NER approaches require substantial prior knowledge of the target language, which is impractical for low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to NER using phonemic representation based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to bridge the gap between representations of different languages. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms baseline models in extremely low-resource languages, with the highest average F-1 score (46.38%) and lowest standard deviation (12.67), particularly demonstrating its robustness with non-Latin scripts.</description>

      <title>Combine and Conquer: A Meta-Analysis on Data Shift and Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a universal approach to seamlessly combine out-of-distribution (OOD) detection scores. These scores encompass a wide range of techniques that leverage the self-confidence of deep learning models and the anomalous behavior of features in the latent space. Not surprisingly, combining such a varied population using simple statistics proves inadequate. To overcome this challenge, we propose a quantile normalization to map these scores into p-values, effectively framing the problem into a multi-variate hypothesis test. Then, we combine these tests using established meta-analysis tools, resulting in a more effective detector with consolidated decision boundaries. Furthermore, we create a probabilistic interpretable criterion by mapping the final statistics into a distribution with known parameters. Through empirical investigation, we explore different types of shifts, each exerting varying degrees of impact on data. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves overall robustness and performance across diverse OOD detection scenarios. Notably, our framework is easily extensible for future developments in detection scores and stands as the first to combine decision boundaries in this context. The code and artifacts associated with this work are publicly available\footnote{\url{https://github.com/edadaltocg/detectors}}.</description>

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is an emerging technique to synthesize 3D objects from 2D images with a wide range of potential applications. However, rendering existing NeRF models is extremely computation intensive, making it challenging to support real-time interaction on mobile devices. In this paper, we take the first initiative to examine the state-of-the-art real-time NeRF rendering technique from a system perspective. We first define the entire working pipeline of the NeRF serving system. We then identify possible control knobs that are critical to the system from the communication, computation, and visual performance perspective. Furthermore, an extensive measurement study is conducted to reveal the effects of these control knobs on system performance. Our measurement results reveal that different control knobs contribute differently towards improving the system performance, with the mesh granularity being the most effective knob and the quantization being the least effective knob. In addition, diverse hardware device settings and network conditions have to be considered to fully unleash the benefit of operating under the appropriate knobs</description>

      <title>FastMem: Fast Memorization of Prompt Improves Context Awareness of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating coherent text, but they often struggle with context awareness, leading to inaccuracies in tasks requiring faithful adherence to provided information. We introduce FastMem, a novel method designed to enhance instruction fine-tuned LLMs' context awareness through fast memorization of the prompt. FastMem maximizes the likelihood of the prompt before inference by fine-tuning only the last Feed-Forward Network (FFN) module. This targeted approach ensures efficient optimization without overfitting, significantly improving the model's ability to comprehend and accurately follow the context. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains in reading comprehension, text summarization and adherence to output structures. For instance, FastMem improves the accuracy of Llama 3-8B-Inst on the NQ-SWAP dataset from 59.1% to 71.6%, and reduces the output structure failure rate of Qwen 1.5-4B-Chat from 34.9% to 25.5%. Extensive experimental results highlight FastMem's potential to offer a robust solution to enhance the reliability and accuracy of LLMs in various applications.

      <title>EERPD: Leveraging Emotion and Emotion Regulation for Improving Personality Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personality is a fundamental construct in psychology, reflecting an individual's behavior, thinking, and emotional patterns. Previous researches have made some progress in personality detection, primarily by utilizing the whole text to predict personality. However, these studies generally tend to overlook psychological knowledge: they rarely apply the well-established correlations between emotion regulation and personality. Based on this, we propose a new personality detection method called EERPD. This method introduces the use of emotion regulation, a psychological concept highly correlated with personality, for personality prediction. By combining this feature with emotion features, it retrieves few-shot examples and provides process CoTs for inferring labels from text. This approach enhances the understanding of LLM for personality within text and improves the performance in personality detection. Experimental results demonstrate that EERPD significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of personality detection, outperforming previous SOTA by 15.05/4.29 in average F1 on the two benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Imperative Learning: A Self-supervised Neural-Symbolic Learning Framework for Robot Autonomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven methods such as reinforcement and imitation learning have achieved remarkable success in robot autonomy. However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, collecting large datasets for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neural-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and strong vision models have enabled rapid research and development in the field of Vision-Language-Action models that enable robotic control. The main objective of these methods is to develop a generalist policy that can control robots with various embodiments. However, in industrial robotic applications such as automated assembly and disassembly, some tasks, such as insertion, demand greater accuracy and involve intricate factors like contact engagement, friction handling, and refined motor skills. Implementing these skills using a generalist policy is challenging because these policies might integrate further sensory data, including force or torque measurements, for enhanced precision. In our method, we present a global control policy based on LLMs that can transfer the control policy to a finite set of skills that are specifically trained to perform high-precision tasks through dynamic context switching. The integration of LLMs into this framework underscores their significance in not only interpreting and processing language inputs but also in enriching the control mechanisms for diverse and intricate robotic operations.</description>

Abstract: News recommendation is crucial for facilitating individuals' access to articles, particularly amid the increasingly digital landscape of news consumption. Consequently, extensive research is dedicated to News Recommender Systems (NRS) with increasingly sophisticated algorithms. Despite this sustained scholarly inquiry, there exists a notable research gap regarding the potential synergy achievable by amalgamating these algorithms to yield superior outcomes. This paper endeavours to address this gap by demonstrating how ensemble methods can be used to combine many diverse state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve superior results on the Microsoft News dataset (MIND). Additionally, we identify scenarios where ensemble methods fail to improve results and offer explanations for this occurrence. Our findings demonstrate that a combination of NRS algorithms can outperform individual algorithms, provided that the base learners are sufficiently diverse, with improvements of up to 5\% observed for an ensemble consisting of a content-based BERT approach and the collaborative filtering LSTUR algorithm. Additionally, our results demonstrate the absence of any improvement when combining insufficiently distinct methods. These findings provide insight into successful approaches of ensemble methods in NRS and advocates for the development of better systems through appropriate ensemble solutions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Temporal Difference Transformer for Video-Text Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, in the field of video-text retrieval, there are many transformer-based methods. Most of them usually stack frame features and regrade frames as tokens, then use transformers for video temporal modeling. However, they commonly neglect the inferior ability of the transformer modeling local temporal information. To tackle this problem, we propose a transformer variant named Multi-Scale Temporal Difference Transformer (MSTDT). MSTDT mainly addresses the defects of the traditional transformer which has limited ability to capture local temporal information. Besides, in order to better model the detailed dynamic information, we make use of the difference feature between frames, which practically reflects the dynamic movement of a video. We extract the inter-frame difference feature and integrate the difference and frame feature by the multi-scale temporal transformer. In general, our proposed MSTDT consists of a short-term multi-scale temporal difference transformer and a long-term temporal transformer. The former focuses on modeling local temporal information, the latter aims at modeling global temporal information. At last, we propose a new loss to narrow the distance of similar samples. Extensive experiments show that backbone, such as CLIP, with MSTDT has attained a new state-of-the-art result.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Spectral Representation for Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based models have achieved notable empirical successes in reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressiveness in modeling complex distributions. Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of extending existing methods for broader real-world applications lies in the computational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is considerably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to generate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the flexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning perspective. In particular, by exploiting the connection between diffusion model and energy-based model, we develop Diffusion Spectral Representation (Diff-SR), a coherent algorithm framework that enables extracting sufficient representations for value functions in Markov decision processes (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We further demonstrate how Diff-SR facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms while explicitly bypassing the difficulty and inference cost of sampling from the diffusion model. Finally, we provide comprehensive empirical studies to verify the benefits of Diff-SR in delivering robust and advantageous performance across various benchmarks with both fully and partially observable settings.</description>

      <title>CBPF: Filtering Poisoned Data Based on Composite Backdoor Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks involve the injection of a limited quantity of poisoned examples containing triggers into the training dataset. During the inference stage, backdoor attacks can uphold a high level of accuracy for normal examples, yet when presented with trigger-containing instances, the model may erroneously predict them as the targeted class designated by the attacker. This paper explores strategies for mitigating the risks associated with backdoor attacks by examining the filtration of poisoned samples.We primarily leverage two key characteristics of backdoor attacks: the ability for multiple backdoors to exist simultaneously within a single model, and the discovery through Composite Backdoor Attack (CBA) that altering two triggers in a sample to new target labels does not compromise the original functionality of the triggers, yet enables the prediction of the data as a new target class when both triggers are present simultaneously.Therefore, a novel three-stage poisoning data filtering approach, known as Composite Backdoor Poison Filtering (CBPF), is proposed as an effective solution. Firstly, utilizing the identified distinctions in output between poisoned and clean samples, a subset of data is partitioned to include both poisoned and clean instances. Subsequently, benign triggers are incorporated and labels are adjusted to create new target and benign target classes, thereby prompting the poisoned and clean data to be classified as distinct entities during the inference stage. The experimental results indicate that CBPF is successful in filtering out malicious data produced by six advanced attacks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet-12. On average, CBPF attains a notable filtering success rate of 99.91% for the six attacks on CIFAR10. Additionally, the model trained on the uncontaminated samples exhibits sustained high accuracy levels.</description>

It has shown promising results in scenarios with little labeled data or to design explainable models. Typically, prototypes are either defined as the average of the embeddings of a class or are designed to be trainable. In this work, we propose to predefine prototypes following human-specified criteria, which simplify the training pipeline and brings different advantages. Specifically, in this work we explore two of these advantages: increasing the inter-class separability of embeddings and disentangling embeddings with respect to different variance factors, which can translate into the possibility of having explainable predictions. Finally, we propose different experiments that help to understand our proposal and demonstrate empirically the mentioned advantages.</description>

      <title>Towards Open Respiratory Acoustic Foundation Models: Pretraining and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Respiratory audio, such as coughing and breathing sounds, has predictive power for a wide range of healthcare applications, yet is currently under-explored. The main problem for those applications arises from the difficulty in collecting large labeled task-specific data for model development. Generalizable respiratory acoustic foundation models pretrained with unlabeled data would offer appealing advantages and possibly unlock this impasse. However, given the safety-critical nature of healthcare applications, it is pivotal to also ensure openness and replicability for any proposed foundation model solution. To this end, we introduce OPERA, an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system, as the first approach answering this need. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets (~136K samples, 440 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health. The system is accessible from https://github.com/evelyn0414/OPERA.</description>

      <title>SimCE: Simplifying Cross-Entropy Loss for Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The learning objective is integral to collaborative filtering systems, where the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss is widely used for learning informative backbones. However, BPR often experiences slow convergence and suboptimal local optima, partially because it only considers one negative item for each positive item, neglecting the potential impacts of other unobserved items. To address this issue, the recently proposed Sampled Softmax Cross-Entropy (SSM) compares one positive sample with multiple negative samples, leading to better performance. Our comprehensive experiments confirm that recommender systems consistently benefit from multiple negative samples during training. Furthermore, we introduce a \underline{Sim}plified Sampled Softmax \underline{C}ross-\underline{E}ntropy Loss (SimCE), which simplifies the SSM using its upper bound. Our validation on 12 benchmark datasets, using both MF and LightGCN backbones, shows that SimCE significantly outperforms both BPR and SSM.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Matrix Diagonalization through Decision Transformers with Epsilon-Greedy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for matrix diagonalization, recasting it as a sequential decision-making problem and applying the power of Decision Transformers (DTs). Our approach determines optimal pivot selection during diagonalization with the Jacobi algorithm, leading to significant speedups compared to the traditional max-element Jacobi method. To bolster robustness, we integrate an epsilon-greedy strategy, enabling success in scenarios where deterministic approaches fail. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of DTs in complex computational tasks and highlights the potential of reimagining mathematical operations through a machine learning lens. Furthermore, we establish the generalizability of our method by using transfer learning to diagonalize matrices of smaller sizes than those trained.</description>

      <title>Learning Run-time Safety Monitors for Machine Learning Components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For machine learning components used as part of autonomous systems (AS) in carrying out critical tasks it is crucial that assurance of the models can be maintained in the face of post-deployment changes (such as changes in the operating environment of the system). A critical part of this is to be able to monitor when the performance of the model at runtime (as a result of changes) poses a safety risk to the system. This is a particularly difficult challenge when ground truth is unavailable at runtime. In this paper we introduce a process for creating safety monitors for ML components through the use of degraded datasets and machine learning. The safety monitor that is created is deployed to the AS in parallel to the ML component to provide a prediction of the safety risk associated with the model output. We demonstrate the viability of our approach through some initial experiments using publicly available speed sign datasets.</description>

      <title>F-FOMAML: GNN-Enhanced Meta-Learning for Peak Period Demand Forecasting with Proxy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demand prediction is a crucial task for e-commerce and physical retail businesses, especially during high-stake sales events. However, the limited availability of historical data from these peak periods poses a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages strategically chosen proxy data reflective of potential sales patterns from similar entities during non-peak periods, enriched by features learned from a graph neural networks (GNNs)-based forecasting model, to predict demand during peak events. We formulate the demand prediction as a meta-learning problem and develop the Feature-based First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (F-FOMAML) algorithm that leverages proxy data from non-peak periods and GNN-generated relational metadata to learn feature-specific layer parameters, thereby adapting to demand forecasts for peak events. Theoretically, we show that by considering domain similarities through task-specific metadata, our model achieves improved generalization, where the excess risk decreases as the number of training tasks increases. Empirical evaluations on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Compared to existing state-of-the-art models, our method demonstrates a notable improvement in demand prediction accuracy, reducing the Mean Absolute Error by 26.24% on an internal vending machine dataset and by 1.04% on the publicly accessible JD.com dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional personality models only yield binary results. This paper presents a novel approach for training personality detection models that produce continuous output values, using mixed strategies. By leveraging the PANDORA dataset, which includes extensive personality labeling of Reddit comments, we developed models that predict the Big Five personality traits with high accuracy. Our approach involves fine-tuning a RoBERTa-base model with various strategies such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) integration, and hyperparameter tuning. The results demonstrate that our models significantly outperform traditional binary classification methods, offering precise continuous outputs for personality traits, thus enhancing applications in AI, psychology, human resources, marketing and health care fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16224v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of chemistry and materials science. Recent examples of LLM-accelerated experimental research include virtual assistants for parsing synthesis recipes from the literature, or using the extracted knowledge to guide synthesis and characterization. Despite these advancements, their application is constrained to labs with automated instruments and control software, leaving much of materials science reliant on manual processes. Here, we demonstrate the rapid deployment of a Python-based control module for a Keithley 2400 electrical source measure unit using ChatGPT-4. Through iterative refinement, we achieved effective instrument management with minimal human intervention. Additionally, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was created, effectively linking all instrument controls to interactive screen elements. Finally, we integrated this AI-crafted instrument control software with a high-performance stochastic optimization algorithm to facilitate rapid and automated extraction of electronic device parameters related to semiconductor charge transport mechanisms from current-voltage (IV) measurement data. This integration resulted in a comprehensive open-source toolkit for semiconductor device characterization and analysis using IV curve measurements. We demonstrate the application of these tools by acquiring, analyzing, and parameterizing IV data from a Pt/Cr$_2$O$_3$:Mg/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterojunction diode, a novel stack for high-power and high-temperature electronic devices. This approach underscores the powerful synergy between LLMs and the development of instruments for scientific inquiry, showcasing a path for further acceleration in materials science.</description>

      <title>Gradual Divergence for Seamless Adaptation: A Novel Domain Incremental Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain incremental learning (DIL) poses a significant challenge in real-world scenarios, as models need to be sequentially trained on diverse domains over time, all the while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Mitigating representation drift, which refers to the phenomenon of learned representations undergoing changes as the model adapts to new tasks, can help alleviate catastrophic forgetting. In this study, we propose a novel DIL method named DARE, featuring a three-stage training process: Divergence, Adaptation, and REfinement. This process gradually adapts the representations associated with new tasks into the feature space spanned by samples from previous tasks, simultaneously integrating task-specific decision boundaries. Additionally, we introduce a novel strategy for buffer sampling and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, combined with this sampling strategy, in reducing representation drift within the feature encoder. This contribution effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting across multiple DIL benchmarks. Furthermore, our approach prevents sudden representation drift at task boundaries, resulting in a well-calibrated DIL model that maintains the performance on previous tasks.</description>

      <title>Jacobian Descent for Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many optimization problems are inherently multi-objective. To address them, we formalize Jacobian descent (JD), a direct generalization of gradient descent for vector-valued functions. Each step of this algorithm relies on a Jacobian matrix consisting of one gradient per objective. The aggregator, responsible for reducing this matrix into an update vector, characterizes JD. While the multi-task learning literature already contains a variety of aggregators, they often lack some natural properties. In particular, the update should not conflict with any objective and should scale proportionally to the norm of each gradient. We propose a new aggregator specifically designed to satisfy this. Emphasizing conflict between objectives, we then highlight direct applications for our methods. Most notably, we introduce instance-wise risk minimization (IWRM), a learning paradigm in which the loss of each training example is considered a separate objective. On simple image classification tasks, IWRM exhibits promising results compared to the direct minimization of the average loss. The performance of our aggregator in those experiments also corroborates our theoretical findings. Lastly, as speed is the main limitation of JD, we provide a path towards a more efficient implementation.</description>

      <title>Preference Tuning For Toxicity Mitigation Generalizes Across Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detoxifying multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their increasing global use. In this work, we explore zero-shot cross-lingual generalization of preference tuning in detoxifying LLMs. Unlike previous studies that show limited cross-lingual generalization for other safety tasks, we demonstrate that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training with only English data can significantly reduce toxicity in multilingual open-ended generations. For example, the probability of mGPT-1.3B generating toxic continuations drops from 46.8% to 3.9% across 17 different languages after training. Our results also extend to other multilingual LLMs, such as BLOOM, Llama3, and Aya-23. Using mechanistic interpretability tools like causal intervention and activation analysis, we identified the dual multilinguality property of MLP layers in LLMs, which explains the cross-lingual generalization of DPO. Finally, we show that bilingual sentence retrieval can predict the cross-lingual transferability of DPO preference tuning.</description>

      <title>Graph-Augmented LLMs for Personalized Health Insights: A Case Study in Sleep Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16252v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Health monitoring systems have revolutionized modern healthcare by enabling the continuous capture of physiological and behavioral data, essential for preventive measures and early health intervention. While integrating this data with Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promise in delivering interactive health advice, traditional methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning often fail to fully utilize the complex, multi-dimensional, and temporally relevant data from wearable devices. These conventional approaches typically provide limited actionable and personalized health insights due to their inadequate capacity to dynamically integrate and interpret diverse health data streams. In response, this paper introduces a graph-augmented LLM framework designed to significantly enhance the personalization and clarity of health insights. Utilizing a hierarchical graph structure, the framework captures inter and intra-patient relationships, enriching LLM prompts with dynamic feature importance scores derived from a Random Forest Model. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through a sleep analysis case study involving 20 college students during the COVID-19 lockdown, highlighting the potential of our model to generate actionable and personalized health insights efficiently. We leverage another LLM to evaluate the insights for relevance, comprehensiveness, actionability, and personalization, addressing the critical need for models that process and interpret complex health data effectively. Our findings show that augmenting prompts with our framework yields significant improvements in all 4 criteria. Through our framework, we can elicit well-crafted, more thoughtful responses tailored to a specific patient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their widespread use, the mechanisms by which large language models (LLMs) represent and regulate uncertainty in next-token predictions remain largely unexplored. This study investigates two critical components believed to influence this uncertainty: the recently discovered entropy neurons and a new set of components that we term token frequency neurons. Entropy neurons are characterized by an unusually high weight norm and influence the final layer normalization (LayerNorm) scale to effectively scale down the logits. Our work shows that entropy neurons operate by writing onto an unembedding null space, allowing them to impact the residual stream norm with minimal direct effect on the logits themselves. We observe the presence of entropy neurons across a range of models, up to 7 billion parameters. On the other hand, token frequency neurons, which we discover and describe here for the first time, boost or suppress each token's logit proportionally to its log frequency, thereby shifting the output distribution towards or away from the unigram distribution. Finally, we present a detailed case study where entropy neurons actively manage confidence in the setting of induction, i.e. detecting and continuing repeated subsequences.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Reward-Free Exploration with General Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mastering multiple tasks through exploration and learning in an environment poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Unsupervised RL has been introduced to address this challenge by training policies with intrinsic rewards rather than extrinsic rewards. However, current intrinsic reward designs and unsupervised RL algorithms often overlook the heterogeneous nature of collected samples, thereby diminishing their sample efficiency. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a reward-free RL algorithm called \alg. The key idea behind our algorithm is an uncertainty-aware intrinsic reward for exploring the environment and an uncertainty-weighted learning process to handle heterogeneous uncertainty in different samples. Theoretically, we show that in order to find an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, GFA-RFE needs to collect $\tilde{O} (H^2 \log N_{\mathcal F} (\epsilon) \mathrm{dim} (\mathcal F) / \epsilon^2 )$ number of episodes, where $\mathcal F$ is the value function class with covering number $N_{\mathcal F} (\epsilon)$ and generalized eluder dimension $\mathrm{dim} (\mathcal F)$. Such a result outperforms all existing reward-free RL algorithms. We further implement and evaluate GFA-RFE across various domains and tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite. Experiment results show that GFA-RFE outperforms or is comparable to the performance of state-of-the-art unsupervised RL algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</description>

      <title>User Story Tutor (UST) to Support Agile Software Developers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User Stories record what must be built in projects that use agile practices. User Stories serve both to estimate effort, generally measured in Story Points, and to plan what should be done in a Sprint. Therefore, it is essential to train software engineers on how to create simple, easily readable, and comprehensive User Stories. For that reason, we designed, implemented, applied, and evaluated a web application called User Story Tutor (UST). UST checks the description of a given User Story for readability, and if needed, recommends appropriate practices for improvement. UST also estimates a User Story effort in Story Points using Machine Learning techniques. As such UST may support the continuing education of agile development teams when writing and reviewing User Stories. UST's ease of use was evaluated by 40 agile practitioners according to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and AttrakDiff. The TAM evaluation averages were good in almost all considered variables. Application of the AttrakDiff evaluation framework produced similar good results. Apparently, UST can be used with good reliability. Applying UST to assist in the construction of User Stories is a viable technique that, at the very least, can be used by agile developments to complement and enhance current User Story creation.</description>

      <title>Video-Infinity: Distributed Long Video Generation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable results for video generation. Despite the encouraging performances, the generated videos are typically constrained to a small number of frames, resulting in clips lasting merely a few seconds. The primary challenges in producing longer videos include the substantial memory requirements and the extended processing time required on a single GPU. A straightforward solution would be to split the workload across multiple GPUs, which, however, leads to two issues: (1) ensuring all GPUs communicate effectively to share timing and context information, and (2) modifying existing video diffusion models, which are usually trained on short sequences, to create longer videos without additional training. To tackle these, in this paper we introduce Video-Infinity, a distributed inference pipeline that enables parallel processing across multiple GPUs for long-form video generation. Specifically, we propose two coherent mechanisms: Clip parallelism and Dual-scope attention. Clip parallelism optimizes the gathering and sharing of context information across GPUs which minimizes communication overhead, while Dual-scope attention modulates the temporal self-attention to balance local and global contexts efficiently across the devices. Together, the two mechanisms join forces to distribute the workload and enable the fast generation of long videos. Under an 8 x Nvidia 6000 Ada GPU (48G) setup, our method generates videos up to 2,300 frames in approximately 5 minutes, enabling long video generation at a speed 100 times faster than the prior methods.</description>

      <title>One Thousand and One Pairs: A "novel" challenge for long-context language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic long-context LLM benchmarks (e.g., "needle-in-the-haystack") test only surface-level retrieval capabilities, but how well can long-context LLMs retrieve, synthesize, and reason over information across book-length inputs? We address this question by creating NoCha, a dataset of 1,001 minimally different pairs of true and false claims about 67 recently-published English fictional books, written by human readers of those books. In contrast to existing long-context benchmarks, our annotators confirm that the largest share of pairs in NoCha require global reasoning over the entire book to verify. Our experiments show that while human readers easily perform this task, it is enormously challenging for all ten long-context LLMs that we evaluate: no open-weight model performs above random chance (despite their strong performance on synthetic benchmarks), while GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy at 55.8%. Further analysis reveals that (1) on average, models perform much better on pairs that require only sentence-level retrieval vs. global reasoning; (2) model-generated explanations for their decisions are often inaccurate even for correctly-labeled claims; and (3) models perform substantially worse on speculative fiction books that contain extensive world-building. The methodology proposed in NoCha allows for the evolution of the benchmark dataset and the easy analysis of future models.</description>

      <title>Repairing Catastrophic-Neglect in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Attention-Guided Feature Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models (T2I DMs) have garnered significant attention for their ability to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, these models often produce images that do not fully align with the input prompts, resulting in semantic inconsistencies. The most prominent issue among these semantic inconsistencies is catastrophic-neglect, where the images generated by T2I DMs miss key objects mentioned in the prompt. We first conduct an empirical study on this issue, exploring the prevalence of catastrophic-neglect, potential mitigation strategies with feature enhancement, and the insights gained. Guided by the empirical findings, we propose an automated repair approach named Patcher to address catastrophic-neglect in T2I DMs. Specifically, Patcher first determines whether there are any neglected objects in the prompt, and then applies attention-guided feature enhancement to these neglected objects, resulting in a repaired prompt. Experimental results on three versions of Stable Diffusion demonstrate that Patcher effectively repairs the issue of catastrophic-neglect, achieving 10.1%-16.3% higher Correct Rate in image generation compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Reducing Fine-Tuning Memory Overhead by Approximate and Memory-Sharing Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained large models to downstream tasks is an important problem, which however suffers from huge memory overhead due to large-scale parameters. This work strives to reduce memory overhead in fine-tuning from perspectives of activation function and layer normalization. To this end, we propose the Approximate Backpropagation (Approx-BP) theory, which provides the theoretical feasibility of decoupling the forward and backward passes. We apply our Approx-BP theory to backpropagation training and derive memory-efficient alternatives of GELU and SiLU activation functions, which use derivative functions of ReLUs in the backward pass while keeping their forward pass unchanged. In addition, we introduce a Memory-Sharing Backpropagation strategy, which enables the activation memory to be shared by two adjacent layers, thereby removing activation memory usage redundancy. Our method neither induces extra computation nor reduces training efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments with pretrained vision and language models, and the results demonstrate that our proposal can reduce up to $\sim$$30\%$ of the peak memory usage. Our code is released at https://github.com/yyyyychen/LowMemoryBP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional supervised learning heavily relies on human-annotated datasets, especially in data-hungry neural approaches. However, various tasks, especially multi-label tasks like document-level relation extraction, pose challenges in fully manual annotation due to the specific domain knowledge and large class sets. Therefore, we address the multi-label positive-unlabelled learning (MLPUL) problem, where only a subset of positive classes is annotated. We propose Mixture Learner for Partially Annotated Classification (MLPAC), an RL-based framework combining the exploration ability of reinforcement learning and the exploitation ability of supervised learning. Experimental results across various tasks, including document-level relation extraction, multi-label image classification, and binary PU learning, demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>LangSuitE: Planning, Controlling and Interacting with Large Language Models in Embodied Text Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown inspiring achievements in constructing autonomous agents that rely on language descriptions as inputs. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs can function as few-shot or zero-shot embodied agents in dynamic interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce LangSuitE, a versatile and simulation-free testbed featuring 6 representative embodied tasks in textual embodied worlds. Compared with previous LLM-based testbeds, LangSuitE (i) offers adaptability to diverse environments without multiple simulation engines, (ii) evaluates agents' capacity to develop ``internalized world knowledge'' with embodied observations, and (iii) allows easy customization of communication and action strategies. To address the embodiment challenge, we devise a novel chain-of-thought (CoT) schema, EmMem, which summarizes embodied states w.r.t. history information. Comprehensive benchmark results illustrate challenges and insights of embodied planning. LangSuitE represents a significant step toward building embodied generalists in the context of language models.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Continuous Constraints of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Physical Dynamics Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating Euclidean symmetries (e.g. rotation equivariance) as inductive biases into graph neural networks has improved their generalization ability and data efficiency in unbounded physical dynamics modeling. However, in various scientific and engineering applications, the symmetries of dynamics are frequently discrete due to the boundary conditions. Thus, existing GNNs either overlook necessary symmetry, resulting in suboptimal representation ability, or impose excessive equivariance, which fails to generalize to unobserved symmetric dynamics. In this work, we propose a general Discrete Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DEGNN) that guarantees equivariance to a given discrete point group. Specifically, we show that such discrete equivariant message passing could be constructed by transforming geometric features into permutation-invariant embeddings. Through relaxing continuous equivariant constraints, DEGNN can employ more geometric feature combinations to approximate unobserved physical object interaction functions. Two implementation approaches of DEGNN are proposed based on ranking or pooling permutation-invariant functions. We apply DEGNN to various physical dynamics, ranging from particle, molecular, crowd to vehicle dynamics. In twenty scenarios, DEGNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we show that DEGNN is data efficient, learning with less data, and can generalize across scenarios such as unobserved orientation.</description>

      <title>Compensate Quantization Errors: Make Weights Hierarchical to Compensate Each Other</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent Large Language Models (LLMs) use their extraordinary performance and powerful deduction capacity to discern from traditional language models. However, the expenses of computational resources and storage for these LLMs are stunning, quantization then arises as a trending conversation. To address accuracy decay caused by quantization, two streams of works in post-training quantization methods stand out. One uses other weights to compensate existing quantization error, while the other transfers the quantization difficulty to other parts in the model. Combining both merits, we introduce Learnable Singular value Increment (LSI) as an advanced solution. LSI uses Singular Value Decomposition to extract singular values of the weights and make them learnable to help weights compensate each other conditioned on activation. Incorporating LSI with existing techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse quantization settings, no matter in weight-only, weight-activation or extremely low bit scenarios. By unleashing the potential of LSI, efficient finetuning on quantized model is no longer a prohibitive problem.</description>

      <title>UBiSS: A Unified Framework for Bimodal Semantic Summarization of Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the surge in the amount of video data, video summarization techniques, including visual-modal(VM) and textual-modal(TM) summarization, are attracting more and more attention. However, unimodal summarization inevitably loses the rich semantics of the video. In this paper, we focus on a more comprehensive video summarization task named Bimodal Semantic Summarization of Videos (BiSSV). Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset, BIDS, in (video, VM-Summary, TM-Summary) triplet format. Unlike traditional processing methods, our construction procedure contains a VM-Summary extraction algorithm aiming to preserve the most salient content within long videos. Based on BIDS, we propose a Unified framework UBiSS for the BiSSV task, which models the saliency information in the video and generates a TM-summary and VM-summary simultaneously. We further optimize our model with a list-wise ranking-based objective to improve its capacity to capture highlights. Lastly, we propose a metric, $NDCG_{MS}$, to provide a joint evaluation of the bimodal summary. Experiments show that our unified framework achieves better performance than multi-stage summarization pipelines. Code and data are available at https://github.com/MeiYutingg/UBiSS.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection of Tabular Data Using LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential in long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we study the problem of using LLMs to detect tabular anomalies and show that pre-trained LLMs are zero-shot batch-level anomaly detectors. That is, without extra distribution-specific model fitting, they can discover hidden outliers in a batch of data, demonstrating their ability to identify low-density data regions. For LLMs that are not well aligned with anomaly detection and frequently output factual errors, we apply simple yet effective data-generating processes to simulate synthetic batch-level anomaly detection datasets and propose an end-to-end fine-tuning strategy to bring out the potential of LLMs in detecting real anomalies. Experiments on a large anomaly detection benchmark (ODDS) showcase i) GPT-4 has on-par performance with the state-of-the-art transductive learning-based anomaly detection methods and ii) the efficacy of our synthetic dataset and fine-tuning strategy in aligning LLMs to this task.</description>

      <title>Does Cross-Cultural Alignment Change the Commonsense Morality of Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alignment of the language model with human preferences is a common approach to making a language model useful to end users. However, most alignment work is done in English, and human preference datasets are dominated by English, reflecting only the preferences of English-speaking annotators. Nevertheless, it is common practice to use the English preference data, either directly or by translating it into the target language, when aligning a multilingual language model. The question is whether such an alignment strategy marginalizes the preference of non-English speaking users. To this end, we investigate the effect of aligning Japanese language models with (mostly) English resources. In particular, we focus on evaluating whether the commonsense morality of the resulting fine-tuned models is aligned with Japanese culture using the JCommonsenseMorality (JCM) and ETHICS datasets. The experimental results show that the fine-tuned model outperforms the SFT model. However, it does not demonstrate the same level of improvement as a model fine-tuned using the JCM, suggesting that while some aspects of commonsense morality are transferable, others may not be.</description>

Abstract: Associating unstructured data with structured information is crucial for real-world tasks that require relevance search. However, existing graph learning benchmarks often overlook the rich semantic information associate with each node. To bridge such gap, we introduce the Multimodal Graph Benchmark (MM-GRAPH), the first comprehensive multi-modal graph benchmark that incorporates both textual and visual information. MM-GRAPH surpasses previous efforts, which have primarily focused on text-attributed graphs with various connectivity patterns. MM-GRAPH consists of five graph learning datasets of various scales that are appropriate for different learning tasks. Their multimodal node features, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of graph learning algorithms in real-world scenarios. To facilitate research on multimodal graph learning, we further provide an extensive study on the performance of various graph neural networks in the presence of features from various modalities. MM-GRAPH aims to foster research on multimodal graph learning and drive the development of more advanced and robust graph learning algorithms. By providing a diverse set of datasets and benchmarks, MM-GRAPH enables researchers to evaluate and compare their models in realistic settings, ultimately leading to improved performance on real-world applications that rely on multimodal graph data.</description>

      <title>Pruning via Merging: Compressing LLMs via Manifold Alignment Based Layer Merging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in many domains, their complexity and scale challenge deployment in resource-limited environments. Current compression techniques, such as parameter pruning, often fail to effectively utilize the knowledge from pruned parameters. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Based Knowledge Alignment and Layer Merging Compression (MKA), a novel approach that uses manifold learning and the Normalized Pairwise Information Bottleneck (NPIB) measure to merge similar layers, reducing model size while preserving essential performance. We evaluate MKA on multiple benchmark datasets and various LLMs. Our findings show that MKA not only preserves model performance but also achieves substantial compression ratios, outperforming traditional pruning methods. Moreover, when coupled with quantization, MKA delivers even greater compression. Specifically, on the MMLU dataset using the Llama3-8B model, MKA achieves a compression ratio of 43.75% with a minimal performance decrease of only 2.82\%. The proposed MKA method offers a resource-efficient and performance-preserving model compression technique for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Consistency Image Generation (PCIG): A Unified Framework Integrating LLMs, Knowledge Graphs, and Controllable Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-to-Image(T2I) generative models has enabled the synthesis of high-quality images guided by textual descriptions. Despite this significant progress, these models are often susceptible in generating contents that contradict the input text, which poses a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. To address this problem, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework to significantly enhance the alignment of generated images with their corresponding descriptions, addressing the inconsistency between visual output and textual input. Our framework is built upon a comprehensive analysis of inconsistency phenomena, categorizing them based on their manifestation in the image. Leveraging a state-of-the-art large language module, we first extract objects and construct a knowledge graph to predict the locations of these objects in potentially generated images. We then integrate a state-of-the-art controllable image generation model with a visual text generation module to generate an image that is consistent with the original prompt, guided by the predicted object locations. Through extensive experiments on an advanced multimodal hallucination benchmark, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately generating the images without the inconsistency with the original prompt. The code can be accessed via https://github.com/TruthAI-Lab/PCIG.</description>

      <title>Directed Domain Fine-Tuning: Tailoring Separate Modalities for Specific Training Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large visual language models (LVLMs) have been at the forefront of the artificial intelligence field, particularly for tasks like text generation, video captioning, and question-answering. Typically, it is more applicable to train these models on broader knowledge bases or datasets to increase generalizability, learn relationships between topics, and recognize patterns. Instead, we propose to provide instructional datasets specific to the task of each modality within a distinct domain and then fine-tune the parameters of the model using LORA. With our approach, we can eliminate all noise irrelevant to the given task while also ensuring that the model generates with enhanced precision. For this work, we use Video-LLaVA to generate recipes given cooking videos without transcripts. Video-LLaVA's multimodal architecture allows us to provide cooking images to its image encoder, cooking videos to its video encoder, and general cooking questions to its text encoder. Thus, we aim to remove all noise unrelated to cooking while improving our model's capabilities to generate specific ingredient lists and detailed instructions. As a result, our approach to fine-tuning Video-LLaVA leads to gains over the baseline Video-LLaVA by 2% on the YouCook2 dataset. While this may seem like a marginal increase, our model trains on an image instruction dataset 2.5% the size of Video-LLaVA's and a video instruction dataset 23.76% of Video-LLaVA's.</description>

      <title>Towards Lightweight Graph Neural Network Search with Curriculum Graph Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has achieved superior performance on various graph-structured tasks. However, existing GNAS studies overlook the applications of GNAS in resource-constraint scenarios. This paper proposes to design a joint graph data and architecture mechanism, which identifies important sub-architectures via the valuable graph data. To search for optimal lightweight Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose a Lightweight Graph Neural Architecture Search with Graph SparsIfication and Network Pruning (GASSIP) method. In particular, GASSIP comprises an operation-pruned architecture search module to enable efficient lightweight GNN search. Meanwhile, we design a novel curriculum graph data sparsification module with an architecture-aware edge-removing difficulty measurement to help select optimal sub-architectures. With the aid of two differentiable masks, we iteratively optimize these two modules to efficiently search for the optimal lightweight architecture. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GASSIP. Particularly, our method achieves on-par or even higher node classification performance with half or fewer model parameters of searched GNNs and a sparser graph.</description>

      <title>On the Transformations across Reward Model, Parameter Update, and In-Context Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the general capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they still need further adaptation to better serve practical applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the interchangeability of three popular and distinct adaptation tools: parameter updating, reward modeling, and in-context prompting. This interchangeability establishes a triangular framework with six transformation directions, each of which facilitates a variety of applications. Our work offers a holistic view that unifies numerous existing studies and suggests potential research directions. We envision our work as a useful roadmap for future research on LLMs.</description>

      <title>Automatically Generating UI Code from Screenshot: A Divide-and-Conquer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Websites are critical in today's digital world, with over 1.11 billion currently active and approximately 252,000 new sites launched daily. Converting website layout design into functional UI code is a time-consuming yet indispensable step of website development. Manual methods of converting visual designs into functional code present significant challenges, especially for non-experts. To explore automatic design-to-code solutions, we first conduct a motivating study on GPT-4o and identify three types of issues in generating UI code: element omission, element distortion, and element misarrangement. We further reveal that a focus on smaller visual segments can help multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mitigate these failures in the generation process. In this paper, we propose DCGen, a divide-and-conquer-based approach to automate the translation of webpage design to UI code. DCGen starts by dividing screenshots into manageable segments, generating descriptions for each segment, and then reassembling them into complete UI code for the entire screenshot. We conduct extensive testing with a dataset comprised of real-world websites and various MLLMs and demonstrate that DCGen achieves up to a 14% improvement in visual similarity over competing methods. To the best of our knowledge, DCGen is the first segment-aware prompt-based approach for generating UI code directly from screenshots.</description>

      <title>PenSLR: Persian end-to-end Sign Language Recognition Using Ensembling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a fast-growing field that aims to fill the communication gaps between the hearing-impaired and people without hearing loss. Existing solutions for Persian Sign Language (PSL) are limited to word-level interpretations, underscoring the need for more advanced and comprehensive solutions. Moreover, previous work on other languages mainly focuses on manipulating the neural network architectures or hardware configurations instead of benefiting from the aggregated results of multiple models. In this paper, we introduce PenSLR, a glove-based sign language system consisting of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and five flexible sensors powered by a deep learning framework capable of predicting variable-length sequences. We achieve this in an end-to-end manner by leveraging the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function, eliminating the need for segmentation of input signals. To further enhance its capabilities, we propose a novel ensembling technique by leveraging a multiple sequence alignment algorithm known as Star Alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a new PSL dataset, including 16 PSL signs with more than 3000 time-series samples in total. We utilize this dataset to evaluate the performance of our system based on four word-level and sentence-level metrics. Our evaluations show that PenSLR achieves a remarkable word accuracy of 94.58% and 96.70% in subject-independent and subject-dependent setups, respectively. These achievements are attributable to our ensembling algorithm, which not only boosts the word-level performance by 0.51% and 1.32% in the respective scenarios but also yields significant enhancements of 1.46% and 4.00%, respectively, in sentence-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification via Frequency-Aware Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning has witnessed great stride with the development of meta-learning. However, most existing methods pay more attention to learning domain-adaptive inductive bias (meta-knowledge) through feature-wise manipulation or task diversity improvement while neglecting the phenomenon that deep networks tend to rely more on high-frequency cues to make the classification decision, which thus degenerates the robustness of learned inductive bias since high-frequency information is vulnerable and easy to be disturbed by noisy information. Hence in this paper, we make one of the first attempts to propose a Frequency-Aware Prompting method with mutual attention for Cross-Domain Few-Shot classification, which can let networks simulate the human visual perception of selecting different frequency cues when facing new recognition tasks. Specifically, a frequency-aware prompting mechanism is first proposed, in which high-frequency components of the decomposed source image are switched either with normal distribution sampling or zeroing to get frequency-aware augment samples. Then, a mutual attention module is designed to learn generalizable inductive bias under CD-FSL settings. More importantly, the proposed method is a plug-and-play module that can be directly applied to most off-the-shelf CD-FLS methods. Experimental results on CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method as well as robustly improve the performance of existing CD-FLS methods.

      <title>Fault Detection for agents on power grid topology optimization: A Comprehensive analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology optimization of transmission networks using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has increasingly come into focus. Various researchers have proposed different DRL agents, which are often benchmarked on the Grid2Op environment from the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) challenges. The environments have many advantages with their realistic chronics and underlying power flow backends. However, the interpretation of agent survival or failure is not always clear, as there are a variety of potential causes. In this work, we focus on the failures of the power grid to identify patterns and detect them a priori. We collect the failed chronics of three different agents on the WCCI 2022 L2RPN environment, totaling about 40k data points. By clustering, we are able to detect five distinct clusters, identifying different failure types. Further, we propose a multi-class prediction approach to detect failures beforehand and evaluate five different models. Here, the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) shows the best performance, with an accuracy of 86%. It also correctly identifies in 91% of the time failure and survival observations. Finally, we provide a detailed feature importance analysis that identifies critical features and regions in the grid.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pseudo Label Optimization in Point-Supervised Nuclei Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved impressive results in nuclei segmentation, but the massive requirement for pixel-wise labels remains a significant challenge. To alleviate the annotation burden, existing methods generate pseudo masks for model training using point labels. However, the generated masks are inevitably different from the ground truth, and these dissimilarities are not handled reasonably during the network training, resulting in the subpar performance of the segmentation model. To tackle this issue, we propose a framework named DoNuSeg, enabling \textbf{D}ynamic pseudo label \textbf{O}ptimization in point-supervised \textbf{Nu}clei \textbf{Seg}mentation. Specifically, DoNuSeg takes advantage of class activation maps (CAMs) to adaptively capture regions with semantics similar to annotated points. To leverage semantic diversity in the hierarchical feature levels, we design a dynamic selection module to choose the optimal one among CAMs from different encoder blocks as pseudo masks. Meanwhile, a CAM-guided contrastive module is proposed to further enhance the accuracy of pseudo masks. In addition to exploiting the semantic information provided by CAMs, we consider location priors inherent to point labels, developing a task-decoupled structure for effectively differentiating nuclei. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DoNuSeg outperforms state-of-the-art point-supervised methods. The code is available at https://github.com/shinning0821/MICCAI24-DoNuSeg.</description>

      <title>Theory on Mixture-of-Experts in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has garnered significant attention because of its ability to adapt to new tasks that arrive over time. Catastrophic forgetting (of old tasks) has been identified as a major issue in CL, as the model adapts to new tasks. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model has recently been shown to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting in CL, by employing a gating network to sparsify and distribute diverse tasks among multiple experts. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis of MoE and its impact on the learning performance in CL. This paper provides the first theoretical results to characterize the impact of MoE in CL via the lens of overparameterized linear regression tasks. We establish the benefit of MoE over a single expert by proving that the MoE model can diversify its experts to specialize in different tasks, while its router learns to select the right expert for each task and balance the loads across all experts. Our study further suggests an intriguing fact that the MoE in CL needs to terminate the update of the gating network after sufficient training rounds to attain system convergence, which is not needed in the existing MoE studies that do not consider the continual task arrival. Furthermore, we provide explicit expressions for the expected forgetting and overall generalization error to characterize the benefit of MoE in the learning performance in CL. Interestingly, adding more experts requires additional rounds before convergence, which may not enhance the learning performance. Finally, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real datasets to extend these insights from linear models to deep neural networks (DNNs), which also shed light on the practical algorithm design for MoE in CL.</description>

      <title>Learning in Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation, a Neural Mass Network Model, treats different subcortical regions of the brain as connected nodes, with connections representing various types of structural, functional, or effective neuronal connectivity between these regions. Each region comprises interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells, consistent with the standard Wilson-Cowan model. By incorporating stable attractors into such a metapopulation model's dynamics, we transform it into a learning algorithm capable of achieving high image and text classification accuracy. We test it on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, in combination with convolutional neural networks, on CIFAR-10 and TF-FLOWERS, and, in combination with a transformer architecture (BERT), on IMDB, always showing high classification accuracy. These numerical evaluations illustrate that minimal modifications to the Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation can reveal unique and previously unobserved dynamics.</description>

      <title>InterCLIP-MEP: Interactive CLIP and Memory-Enhanced Predictor for Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of sarcasm in social media, conveyed through text-image combinations, presents significant challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Current multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been proven to struggle with biases from spurious cues, leading to a superficial understanding of the complex interactions between text and image. To address these issues, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, a robust framework for multi-modal sarcasm detection. InterCLIP-MEP introduces a refined variant of CLIP, Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP), as the backbone, enhancing sample representations by embedding cross-modality information in each encoder. Furthermore, a novel training strategy is designed to adapt InterCLIP for a Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP). MEP uses dynamic dual-channel memory to store valuable historical knowledge of test samples and then leverages this memory as a non-parametric classifier to derive the final prediction. By using InterCLIP to encode text-image interactions more effectively and incorporating MEP, InterCLIP-MEP offers a more robust recognition of multi-modal sarcasm. Experiments demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMSD2.0 benchmark. Code and data are available at [https://github.com/CoderChen01/InterCLIP-MEP](https://github.com/CoderChen01/InterCLIP-MEP).</description>

      <title>Seeking Certainty In Uncertainty: Dual-Stage Unified Framework Solving Uncertainty in Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contemporary state-of-the-art of Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) technology facilitates remarkable progress by deriving emotional mappings of facial expressions from video content, underpinned by training on voluminous datasets. Yet, the DFER datasets encompass a substantial volume of noise data. Noise arises from low-quality captures that defy logical labeling, and instances that suffer from mislabeling due to annotation bias, engendering two principal types of uncertainty: the uncertainty regarding data usability and the uncertainty concerning label reliability. Addressing the two types of uncertainty, we have meticulously crafted a two-stage framework aiming at \textbf{S}eeking \textbf{C}ertain data \textbf{I}n extensive \textbf{U}ncertain data (SCIU). This initiative aims to purge the DFER datasets of these uncertainties, thereby ensuring that only clean, verified data is employed in training processes. To mitigate the issue of low-quality samples, we introduce the Coarse-Grained Pruning (CGP) stage, which assesses sample weights and prunes those deemed unusable due to their low weight. For samples with incorrect annotations, the Fine-Grained Correction (FGC) stage evaluates prediction stability to rectify mislabeled data. Moreover, SCIU is conceived as a universally compatible, plug-and-play framework, tailored to integrate seamlessly with prevailing DFER methodologies. Rigorous experiments across prevalent DFER datasets and against numerous benchmark methods substantiates SCIU's capacity to markedly elevate performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Emerging NeoHebbian Dynamics in Forward-Forward Learning: Implications for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in neural computation have predominantly relied on the gradient backpropagation algorithm (BP). However, the recent shift towards non-stationary data modeling has highlighted the limitations of this heuristic, exposing that its adaptation capabilities are far from those seen in biological brains. Unlike BP, where weight updates are computed through a reverse error propagation path, Hebbian learning dynamics provide synaptic updates using only information within the layer itself. This has spurred interest in biologically plausible learning algorithms, hypothesized to overcome BP's shortcomings. In this context, Hinton recently introduced the Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA), which employs local learning rules for each layer and has empirically proven its efficacy in multiple data modeling tasks. In this work we argue that when employing a squared Euclidean norm as a goodness function driving the local learning, the resulting FFA is equivalent to a neo-Hebbian Learning Rule. To verify this result, we compare the training behavior of FFA in analog networks with its Hebbian adaptation in spiking neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that both versions of FFA produce similar accuracy and latent distributions. The findings herein reported provide empirical evidence linking biological learning rules with currently used training algorithms, thus paving the way towards extrapolating the positive outcomes from FFA to Hebbian learning rules. Simultaneously, our results imply that analog networks trained under FFA could be directly applied to neuromorphic computing, leading to reduced energy usage and increased computational speed.</description>

      <title>Cross-domain Transfer of Valence Preferences via a Meta-optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation offers a potential avenue for alleviating data sparsity and cold-start problems. Embedding and mapping, as a classic cross-domain research genre, aims to identify a common mapping function to perform representation transformation between two domains. Nevertheless, previous coarse-grained preference representations, non-personalized mapping functions, and excessive reliance on overlapping users limit their performance, especially in scenarios where overlapping users are sparse. To address aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel cross-domain approach, namely CVPM. CVPM formalizes cross-domain interest transfer as a hybrid architecture of parametric meta-learning and self-supervised learning, which not only transfers user preferences at a finer level, but also enables signal enhancement with the knowledge of non-overlapping users. Specifically, with deep insights into user preferences and valence preference theory, we believe that there exists significant difference between users' positive preferences and negative behaviors, and thus employ differentiated encoders to learn their distributions. In particular, we further utilize the pre-trained model and item popularity to sample pseudo-interaction items to ensure the integrity of both distributions. To guarantee the personalization of preference transfer, we treat each user's mapping as two parts, the common transformation and the personalized bias, where the network used to generate the personalized bias is output by a meta-learner. Furthermore, in addition to the supervised loss for overlapping users, we design contrastive tasks for non-overlapping users from both group and individual-levels to avoid model skew and enhance the semantics of representations. Exhaustive data analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>OTCE: Hybrid SSM and Attention with Cross Domain Mixture of Experts to construct Observer-Thinker-Conceiver-Expresser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16495v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that combining Mamba with Transformer architecture, which has selective state space and quadratic self-attention mechanism, outperforms using Mamba or Transformer architecture alone in language modeling tasks. The quadratic self-attention mechanism effectively alleviates the shortcomings of selective state space in handling long-term dependencies of any element in the sequence. We propose a position information injection method that connects the selective state space model with the quadratic attention, and integrates these two architectures with hybrid experts with cross-sharing domains, so that we can enjoy the advantages of both. We design a new architecture with a more biomimetic idea: Observer-Thinker-Conceiver-Expresser (OTCE), which can compete with well-known medium-scale open-source language models on a small scale in language modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>UNICAD: A Unified Approach for Attack Detection, Noise Reduction and Novel Class Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) becomes pervasive, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks and limitations in handling unseen classes poses significant challenges. The state-of-the-art offers discrete solutions aimed to tackle individual issues covering specific adversarial attack scenarios, classification or evolving learning. However, real-world systems need to be able to detect and recover from a wide range of adversarial attacks without sacrificing classification accuracy and to flexibly act in {\bf unseen} scenarios. In this paper, UNICAD, is proposed as a novel framework that integrates a variety of techniques to provide an adaptive solution.
  For the targeted image classification, UNICAD achieves accurate image classification, detects unseen classes, and recovers from adversarial attacks using Prototype and Similarity-based DNNs with denoising autoencoders. Our experiments performed on the CIFAR-10 dataset highlight UNICAD's effectiveness in adversarial mitigation and unseen class classification, outperforming traditional models.</description>

      <title>$\text{Alpha}^2$: Discovering Logical Formulaic Alphas using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alphas are pivotal in providing signals for quantitative trading. The industry highly values the discovery of formulaic alphas for their interpretability and ease of analysis, compared with the expressive yet overfitting-prone black-box alphas. In this work, we focus on discovering formulaic alphas. Prior studies on automatically generating a collection of formulaic alphas were mostly based on genetic programming (GP), which is known to suffer from the problems of being sensitive to the initial population, converting to local optima, and slow computation speed. Recent efforts employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for alpha discovery have not fully addressed key practical considerations such as alpha correlations and validity, which are crucial for their effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel framework for alpha discovery using DRL by formulating the alpha discovery process as program construction. Our agent, $\text{Alpha}^2$, assembles an alpha program optimized for an evaluation metric. A search algorithm guided by DRL navigates through the search space based on value estimates for potential alpha outcomes. The evaluation metric encourages both the performance and the diversity of alphas for a better final trading strategy. Our formulation of searching alphas also brings the advantage of pre-calculation dimensional analysis, ensuring the logical soundness of alphas, and pruning the vast search space to a large extent. Empirical experiments on real-world stock markets demonstrates $\text{Alpha}^2$'s capability to identify a diverse set of logical and effective alphas, which significantly improves the performance of the final trading strategy. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/x35f/alpha2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positive thinking is thought to be an important component of self-motivation in various practical fields such as education and the workplace. Previous work, including sentiment transfer and positive reframing, has focused on the positive side of language. However, self-motivation that drives people to reach their goals has not yet been studied from a computational perspective. Moreover, negative feedback has not yet been explored, even though positive and negative feedback are both necessary to grow self-motivation. To facilitate self-motivation, we propose CArrot and STICk (CASTIC) dataset, consisting of 12,590 sentences with 5 different strategies for enhancing self-motivation. Our data and code are publicly available at here.</description>

      <title>NARRepair: Non-Autoregressive Code Generation Model for Automatic Program Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning techniques, the performance of Automatic Program Repair(APR) techniques has reached a new level. Previous deep learning-based APR techniques essentially modified program sentences in the Autoregressive(AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values. Due to the manner of word-by-word generation, the AR-based APR technique has a huge time delay. This negative consequence overshadows the widespread adoption of APR techniques in real-life software development.
  To address the issue, we aim to apply the Non-Autoregressive(NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code in a parallel manner to avoid huge inference delays. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper propose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR task. The NARRepair features three major novelties, including 1) using repair actions to alleviate the over-correction issue, 2) extracting dependency information from AST to alleviate the issue of lacking inter-word dependency information, 3) employing two-stage decoding to alleviate the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair on three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that our technique can significantly improve the inference speed while maintaining high repair accuracy.</description>

      <title>Token-based Decision Criteria Are Suboptimal in In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) typically utilizes classification criteria from probabilities of manually selected label tokens. However, we argue that such token-based classification criteria lead to suboptimal decision boundaries, despite delicate calibrations through translation and constrained rotation. To address this problem, we propose Hidden Calibration, which renounces token probabilities and uses the nearest centroid classifier on the LM's last hidden states. In detail, we use the nearest centroid classification on the hidden states, assigning the category of the nearest centroid previously observed from a few-shot calibration set to the test sample as the predicted label. Our experiments on 3 models and 10 classification datasets indicate that Hidden Calibration consistently outperforms current token-based calibrations by about 20%. Our further analysis demonstrates that Hidden Calibration finds better classification criteria with less inter-categories overlap, and LMs provide linearly separable intra-category clusters with the help of demonstrations, which supports Hidden Calibration and gives new insights into the conventional ICL.</description>

      <title>Character-Adapter: Prompt-Guided Region Control for High-Fidelity Character Customization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Customized image generation, which seeks to synthesize images with consistent characters, holds significant relevance for applications such as storytelling, portrait generation, and character design. However, previous approaches have encountered challenges in preserving characters with high-fidelity consistency due to inadequate feature extraction and concept confusion of reference characters. Therefore, we propose Character-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework designed to generate images that preserve the details of reference characters, ensuring high-fidelity consistency. Character-Adapter employs prompt-guided segmentation to ensure fine-grained regional features of reference characters and dynamic region-level adapters to mitigate concept confusion. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of Character-Adapter. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that Character-Adapter achieves the state-of-the-art performance of consistent character generation, with an improvement of 24.8% compared with other methods</description>

      <title>Inference of Sequential Patterns for Neural Message Passing in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modelling of temporal patterns in dynamic graphs is an important current research issue in the development of time-aware GNNs. Whether or not a specific sequence of events in a temporal graph constitutes a temporal pattern not only depends on the frequency of its occurrence. We consider whether it deviates from what is expected in a temporal graph where timestamps are randomly shuffled. While accounting for such a random baseline is important to model temporal patterns, it has mostly been ignored by current temporal graph neural networks. To address this issue we propose HYPA-DBGNN, a novel two-step approach that combines (i) the inference of anomalous sequential patterns in time series data on graphs based on a statistically principled null model, with (ii) a neural message passing approach that utilizes a higher-order De Bruijn graph whose edges capture overrepresented sequential patterns. Our method leverages hypergeometric graph ensembles to identify anomalous edges within both first- and higher-order De Bruijn graphs, which encode the temporal ordering of events. The model introduces an inductive bias that enhances model interpretability. We evaluate our approach for static node classification using benchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset that showcases its ability to incorporate the observed inductive bias regarding over- and under-represented temporal edges. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in detecting similar patterns within empirical datasets, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods in node classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce statistically informed GNNs that leverage temporal and causal sequence anomalies. HYPA-DBGNN represents a path for bridging the gap between statistical graph inference and neural graph representation learning, with potential applications to static GNNs.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Distributionally Robust Optimization Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing research interest in decision-focused learning, which embeds optimization problems as a layer in learning pipelines and demonstrates a superior performance than the prediction-focused approach. However, for distributionally robust optimization (DRO), a popular paradigm for decision-making under uncertainty, it is still unknown how to embed it as a layer, i.e., how to differentiate decisions with respect to an ambiguity set. In this paper, we develop such differentiable DRO layers for generic mixed-integer DRO problems with parameterized second-order conic ambiguity sets and discuss its extension to Wasserstein ambiguity sets. To differentiate the mixed-integer decisions, we propose a novel dual-view methodology by handling continuous and discrete parts of decisions via different principles. Specifically, we construct a differentiable energy-based surrogate to implement the dual-view methodology and use importance sampling to estimate its gradient. We further prove that such a surrogate enjoys the asymptotic convergency under regularization. As an application of the proposed differentiable DRO layers, we develop a novel decision-focused learning pipeline for contextual distributionally robust decision-making tasks and compare it with the prediction-focused approach in experiments.</description>

      <title>QuadrupedGPT: Towards a Versatile Quadruped Agent in Open-ended Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While pets offer companionship, their limited intelligence restricts advanced reasoning and autonomous interaction with humans. Considering this, we propose QuadrupedGPT, a versatile agent designed to master a broad range of complex tasks with agility comparable to that of a pet. To achieve this goal, the primary challenges include: i) effectively leveraging multimodal observations for decision-making; ii) mastering agile control of locomotion and path planning; iii) developing advanced cognition to execute long-term objectives. QuadrupedGPT processes human command and environmental contexts using a large multimodal model (LMM). Empowered by its extensive knowledge base, our agent autonomously assigns appropriate parameters for adaptive locomotion policies and guides the agent in planning a safe but efficient path towards the goal, utilizing semantic-aware terrain analysis. Moreover, QuadrupedGPT is equipped with problem-solving capabilities that enable it to decompose long-term goals into a sequence of executable subgoals through high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks confirm that QuadrupedGPT can adeptly handle multiple tasks with intricate instructions, demonstrating a significant step towards the versatile quadruped agents in open-ended worlds.

      <title>CLEAR: Can Language Models Really Understand Causal Graphs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal reasoning is a cornerstone of how humans interpret the world. To model and reason about causality, causal graphs offer a concise yet effective solution. Given the impressive advancements in language models, a crucial question arises: can they really understand causal graphs? To this end, we pioneer an investigation into language models' understanding of causal graphs. Specifically, we develop a framework to define causal graph understanding, by assessing language models' behaviors through four practical criteria derived from diverse disciplines (e.g., philosophy and psychology). We then develop CLEAR, a novel benchmark that defines three complexity levels and encompasses 20 causal graph-based tasks across these levels. Finally, based on our framework and benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on six leading language models and summarize five empirical findings. Our results indicate that while language models demonstrate a preliminary understanding of causal graphs, significant potential for improvement remains.

      <title>Evaluating the Robustness of Deep-Learning Algorithm-Selection Models by Evolving Adversarial Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly being used to perform algorithm-selection in combinatorial optimisation domains, particularly as they accommodate input representations which avoid designing and calculating features. Mounting evidence from domains that use images as input shows that deep convolutional networks are vulnerable to adversarial samples, in which a small perturbation of an instance can cause the DNN to misclassify. However, it remains unknown as to whether deep recurrent networks (DRN) which have recently been shown promise as algorithm-selectors in the bin-packing domain are equally vulnerable. We use an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to find perturbations of instances from two existing benchmarks for online bin packing that cause trained DRNs to misclassify: adversarial samples are successfully generated from up to 56% of the original instances depending on the dataset. Analysis of the new misclassified instances sheds light on the `fragility' of some training instances, i.e. instances where it is trivial to find a small perturbation that results in a misclassification and the factors that influence this. Finally, the method generates a large number of new instances misclassified with a wide variation in confidence, providing a rich new source of training data to create more robust models.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Language Models in the Medical Context Under Resource-Constrained Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the emergence of the Transformer architecture, language model development has increased, driven by their promising potential. However, releasing these models into production requires properly understanding their behavior, particularly in sensitive domains such as medicine. Despite this need, the medical literature still lacks technical assessments of pre-trained language models, which are especially valuable in resource-constrained settings in terms of computational power or limited budget. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey of language models in the medical domain. In addition, we selected a subset of these models for thorough evaluation, focusing on classification and text generation tasks. Our subset encompasses 53 models, ranging from 110 million to 13 billion parameters, spanning the three families of Transformer-based models and from diverse knowledge domains. This study employs a series of approaches for text classification together with zero-shot prompting instead of model training or fine-tuning, which closely resembles the limited resource setting in which many users of language models find themselves. Encouragingly, our findings reveal remarkable performance across various tasks and datasets, underscoring the latent potential of certain models to contain medical knowledge, even without domain specialization. Consequently, our study advocates for further exploration of model applications in medical contexts, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

      <title>ShadowLLM: Predictor-based Contextual Sparsity for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high power consumption and latency-sensitive deployments of large language models (LLMs) have motivated techniques like quantization and sparsity. Contextual sparsity, where the sparsity pattern is input-dependent, is crucial in LLMs because the permanent removal of attention heads or neurons from LLMs can significantly degrade accuracy. Prior work has attempted to model contextual sparsity using neural networks trained to predict activation magnitudes, which can be used to dynamically prune structures with low predicted activation magnitude. In this paper, we look beyond magnitude-based pruning criteria to assess attention head and neuron importance in LLMs. We developed a novel predictor called ShadowLLM, which can shadow the LLM behavior and enforce better sparsity patterns, resulting in over 15% improvement in end-to-end accuracy without increasing latency compared to previous methods. ShadowLLM achieves up to a 20\% speed-up over the state-of-the-art DejaVu framework. These enhancements are validated on models with up to 30 billion parameters. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/shadow_llm/}{ShadowLLM}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is a crucial area of research that involves understanding human movements using computer and machine vision technology. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, with models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers being employed to capture various aspects of human motion. One of the key contributions of this work is the demonstration of the effectiveness of feature fusion in improving HAR accuracy by capturing spatial and temporal features, which has important implications for the development of more accurate and robust activity recognition systems. The study uses sensory data from HuGaDB, PKU-MMD, LARa, and TUG datasets. Two model, the PO-MS-GCN and a Transformer were trained and evaluated, with PO-MS-GCN outperforming state-of-the-art models. HuGaDB and TUG achieved high accuracies and f1-scores, while LARa and PKU-MMD had lower scores. Feature fusion improved results across datasets.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Consistency Guided Multi-modal Prompt Learning for Blind AI Generated Image Quality Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, textual prompt tuning has shown inspirational performance in adapting Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models to natural image quality assessment. However, such uni-modal prompt learning method only tunes the language branch of CLIP models. This is not enough for adapting CLIP models to AI generated image quality assessment (AGIQA) since AGIs visually differ from natural images. In addition, the consistency between AGIs and user input text prompts, which correlates with the perceptual quality of AGIs, is not investigated to guide AGIQA. In this letter, we propose vision-language consistency guided multi-modal prompt learning for blind AGIQA, dubbed CLIP-AGIQA. Specifically, we introduce learnable textual and visual prompts in language and vision branches of CLIP models, respectively. Moreover, we design a text-to-image alignment quality prediction task, whose learned vision-language consistency knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the above multi-modal prompts. Experimental results on two public AGIQA datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment models. The source code is available at https://github.com/JunFu1995/CLIP-AGIQA.</description>

      <title>CAVE: Controllable Authorship Verification Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Authorship Verification (AV) (do two documents have the same author?) is essential for many sensitive real-life applications. AV is often used in proprietary domains that require a private, offline model, making SOTA online models like ChatGPT undesirable. Other SOTA systems use methods, e.g. Siamese Networks, that are uninterpretable, and hence cannot be trusted in high-stakes applications. In this work, we take the first step to address the above challenges with our model CAVE (Controllable Authorship Verification Explanations): CAVE generates free-text AV explanations that are controlled to be 1) structured (can be decomposed into sub-explanations with respect to relevant linguistic features), and 2) easily verified for explanation-label consistency (via intermediate labels in sub-explanations). In this work, we train a Llama-3-8B as CAVE; since there are no human-written corpora for AV explanations, we sample silver-standard explanations from GPT-4-TURBO and distill them into a pretrained Llama-3-8B. Results on three difficult AV datasets IMdB2, Blog-Auth, and FanFiction show that CAVE generates high quality explanations (as measured by automatic and human evaluation) as well as competitive task accuracies.</description>

      <title>Segment Any Text: A Universal Approach for Robust, Efficient and Adaptable Sentence Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segmenting text into sentences plays an early and crucial role in many NLP systems. This is commonly achieved by using rule-based or statistical methods relying on lexical features such as punctuation. Although some recent works no longer exclusively rely on punctuation, we find that no prior method achieves all of (i) robustness to missing punctuation, (ii) effective adaptability to new domains, and (iii) high efficiency. We introduce a new model - Segment any Text (SaT) - to solve this problem. To enhance robustness, we propose a new pretraining scheme that ensures less reliance on punctuation. To address adaptability, we introduce an extra stage of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, establishing state-of-the-art performance in distinct domains such as verses from lyrics and legal documents. Along the way, we introduce architectural modifications that result in a threefold gain in speed over the previous state of the art and solve spurious reliance on context far in the future. Finally, we introduce a variant of our model with fine-tuning on a diverse, multilingual mixture of sentence-segmented data, acting as a drop-in replacement and enhancement for existing segmentation tools. Overall, our contributions provide a universal approach for segmenting any text. Our method outperforms all baselines - including strong LLMs - across 8 corpora spanning diverse domains and languages, especially in practically relevant situations where text is poorly formatted. Our models and code, including documentation, are available at https://huggingface.co/segment-any-text under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction with Untrained Message Passing Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) operate on graphs by exchanging information between neigbouring nodes. MPNNs have been successfully applied to various node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in areas like molecular science, computer vision, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, most MPNNs require training on large amounts of labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming. In this work, we explore the use of various untrained message passing layers in graph neural networks, i.e. variants of popular message passing architecture where we remove all trainable parameters that are used to transform node features in the message passing step. Focusing on link prediction, we find that untrained message passing layers can lead to competitive and even superior performance compared to fully trained MPNNs, especially in the presence of high-dimensional features. We provide a theoretical analysis of untrained message passing by relating the inner products of features implicitly produced by untrained message passing layers to path-based topological node similarity measures. As such, untrained message passing architectures can be viewed as a highly efficient and interpretable approach to link prediction.</description>

      <title>Public Constitutional AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are increasingly subjected to the power of AI authorities. As AI decisions become inescapable, entering domains such as healthcare, education, and law, we must confront a vital question: how can we ensure AI systems have the legitimacy necessary for effective governance? This essay argues that to secure AI legitimacy, we need methods that engage the public in designing and constraining AI systems, ensuring these technologies reflect the community's shared values. Constitutional AI, proposed by Anthropic, represents a step towards this goal, offering a model for democratic control of AI. However, while Constitutional AI's commitment to hardcoding explicit principles into AI models enhances transparency and accountability, it falls short in two crucial aspects: addressing the opacity of individual AI decisions and fostering genuine democratic legitimacy. To overcome these limitations, this essay proposes "Public Constitutional AI." This approach envisions a participatory process where diverse stakeholders, including ordinary citizens, deliberate on the principles guiding AI development. The resulting "AI Constitution" would carry the legitimacy of popular authorship, grounding AI governance in the public will. Furthermore, the essay proposes "AI Courts" to develop "AI case law," providing concrete examples for operationalizing constitutional principles in AI training. This evolving combination of constitutional principles and case law aims to make AI governance more responsive to public values. By grounding AI governance in deliberative democratic processes, Public Constitutional AI offers a path to imbue automated authorities with genuine democratic legitimacy, addressing the unique challenges posed by increasingly powerful AI systems while ensuring their alignment with the public interest.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Subgoal Representations for Hierarchical Reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), a high-level policy specifies a subgoal for the low-level policy to reach. Effective HRL hinges on a suitable subgoal represen tation function, abstracting state space into latent subgoal space and inducing varied low-level behaviors. Existing methods adopt a subgoal representation that provides a deterministic mapping from state space to latent subgoal space. Instead, this paper utilizes Gaussian Processes (GPs) for the first probabilistic subgoal representation. Our method employs a GP prior on the latent subgoal space to learn a posterior distribution over the subgoal representation functions while exploiting the long-range correlation in the state space through learnable kernels. This enables an adaptive memory that integrates long-range subgoal information from prior planning steps allowing to cope with stochastic uncertainties. Furthermore, we propose a novel learning objective to facilitate the simultaneous learning of probabilistic subgoal representations and policies within a unified framework. In experiments, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in standard benchmarks but also in environments with stochastic elements and under diverse reward conditions. Additionally, our model shows promising capabilities in transferring low-level policies across different tasks.</description>

      <title>AutoDetect: Towards a Unified Framework for Automated Weakness Detection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful, they still exhibit significant but subtle weaknesses, such as mistakes in instruction-following or coding tasks. As these unexpected errors could lead to severe consequences in practical deployments, it is crucial to investigate the limitations within LLMs systematically. Traditional benchmarking approaches cannot thoroughly pinpoint specific model deficiencies, while manual inspections are costly and not scalable. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework, AutoDetect, to automatically expose weaknesses in LLMs across various tasks. Inspired by the educational assessment process that measures students' learning outcomes, AutoDetect consists of three LLM-powered agents: Examiner, Questioner, and Assessor. The collaboration among these three agents is designed to realize comprehensive and in-depth weakness identification. Our framework demonstrates significant success in uncovering flaws, with an identification success rate exceeding 30% in prominent models such as ChatGPT and Claude. More importantly, these identified weaknesses can guide specific model improvements, proving more effective than untargeted data augmentation methods like Self-Instruct. Our approach has led to substantial enhancements in popular LLMs, including the Llama series and Mistral-7b, boosting their performance by over 10% across several benchmarks. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/AutoDetect.</description>

      <title>Convolutional neural network for Lyman break galaxies classification and redshift regression in DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DESI is a groundbreaking international project to observe more than 40 million quasars and galaxies over a 5-year period to create a 3D map of the sky. This map will enable us to probe multiple aspects of cosmology, from dark energy to neutrino mass. We are focusing here on one type of object observed by DESI, the Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The aim is to use their spectra to determine whether they are indeed LBGs, and if so, to determine their distance from the Earth using a phenomenon called redshift. This will enable us to place these galaxies on the DESI 3D map.
  The aim is therefore to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by QuasarNET (See arXiv:1808.09955), performing simultaneously a classification (LBG type or not) and a regression task (determine the redshift of the LBGs). Initially, data augmentation techniques such as shifting the spectra in wavelengths, adding noise to the spectra, or adding synthetic spectra were used to increase the model training dataset from 3,019 data to over 66,000. In a second phase, modifications to the QuasarNET architecture, notably through transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization, boosted model performance.
  Gains of up to 26% were achieved on the Purity/Efficiency curve, which is used to evaluate model performance, particularly in areas with interesting redshifts, at low (around 2) and high (around 4) redshifts. The best model obtained an average score of 94%, compared with 75% for the initial model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new and interesting means for classifying textual data. While evaluating and remediating group fairness is a well-studied problem in classifier fairness literature, some classical approaches (e.g., regularization) do not carry over, and some new opportunities arise (e.g., prompt-based remediation). We measure fairness of LLM-based classifiers on a toxicity classification task, and empirically show that prompt-based classifiers may lead to unfair decisions. We introduce several remediation techniques and benchmark their fairness and performance trade-offs. We hope our work encourages more research on group fairness in LLM-based classifiers.</description>

Abstract: Neutron-Transformer Reflectometry and Advanced Computation Engine (N-TRACE ), a neural network model using transformer architecture, is introduced for neutron reflectometry data analysis. It offers fast, accurate initial parameter estimations and efficient refinements, improving efficiency and precision for real-time data analysis of lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction for electrochemical ammonia synthesis, with relevance to other chemical transformations and batteries. Despite limitations in generalizing across systems, it shows promises for the use of transformers as the basis for models that could replace trial-and-error approaches to modeling reflectometry data.</description>

      <title>Bandits with Preference Feedback: A Stackelberg Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandits with preference feedback present a powerful tool for optimizing unknown target functions when only pairwise comparisons are allowed instead of direct value queries. This model allows for incorporating human feedback into online inference and optimization and has been employed in systems for fine-tuning large language models. The problem is well understood in simplified settings with linear target functions or over finite small domains that limit practical interest. Taking the next step, we consider infinite domains and nonlinear (kernelized) rewards. In this setting, selecting a pair of actions is quite challenging and requires balancing exploration and exploitation at two levels: within the pair, and along the iterations of the algorithm. We propose MAXMINLCB, which emulates this trade-off as a zero-sum Stackelberg game, and chooses action pairs that are informative and yield favorable rewards. MAXMINLCB consistently outperforms existing algorithms and satisfies an anytime-valid rate-optimal regret guarantee. This is due to our novel preference-based confidence sequences for kernelized logistic estimators.</description>

      <title>The Responsible Foundation Model Development Cheatsheet: A Review of Tools &amp; Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation model development attracts a rapidly expanding body of contributors, scientists, and applications. To help shape responsible development practices, we introduce the Foundation Model Development Cheatsheet: a growing collection of 250+ tools and resources spanning text, vision, and speech modalities. We draw on a large body of prior work to survey resources (e.g. software, documentation, frameworks, guides, and practical tools) that support informed data selection, processing, and understanding, precise and limitation-aware artifact documentation, efficient model training, advance awareness of the environmental impact from training, careful model evaluation of capabilities, risks, and claims, as well as responsible model release, licensing and deployment practices. We hope this curated collection of resources helps guide more responsible development. The process of curating this list, enabled us to review the AI development ecosystem, revealing what tools are critically missing, misused, or over-used in existing practices. We find that (i) tools for data sourcing, model evaluation, and monitoring are critically under-serving ethical and real-world needs, (ii) evaluations for model safety, capabilities, and environmental impact all lack reproducibility and transparency, (iii) text and particularly English-centric analyses continue to dominate over multilingual and multi-modal analyses, and (iv) evaluation of systems, rather than just models, is needed so that capabilities and impact are assessed in context.</description>

      <title>Addressing Polarization and Unfairness in Performative Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When machine learning (ML) models are used in applications that involve humans (e.g., online recommendation, school admission, hiring, lending), the model itself may trigger changes in the distribution of targeted data it aims to predict. Performative prediction (PP) is a framework that explicitly considers such model-dependent distribution shifts when learning ML models. While significant efforts have been devoted to finding performative stable (PS) solutions in PP for system robustness, their societal implications are less explored and it is unclear whether PS solutions are aligned with social norms such as fairness. In this paper, we set out to examine the fairness property of PS solutions in performative prediction. We first show that PS solutions can incur severe polarization effects and group-wise loss disparity. Although existing fairness mechanisms commonly used in literature can help mitigate unfairness, they may fail and disrupt the stability under model-dependent distribution shifts. We thus propose novel fairness intervention mechanisms that can simultaneously achieve both stability and fairness in PP settings. Both theoretical analysis and experiments are provided to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>WARP: On the Benefits of Weight Averaged Rewarded Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns large language models (LLMs) by encouraging their generations to have high rewards, using a reward model trained on human preferences. To prevent the forgetting of pre-trained knowledge, RLHF usually incorporates a KL regularization; this forces the policy to remain close to its supervised fine-tuned initialization, though it hinders the reward optimization. To tackle the trade-off between KL and reward, in this paper we introduce a novel alignment strategy named Weight Averaged Rewarded Policies (WARP). WARP merges policies in the weight space at three distinct stages. First, it uses the exponential moving average of the policy as a dynamic anchor in the KL regularization. Second, it applies spherical interpolation to merge independently fine-tuned policies into a new enhanced one. Third, it linearly interpolates between this merged model and the initialization, to recover features from pre-training. This procedure is then applied iteratively, with each iteration's final model used as an advanced initialization for the next, progressively refining the KL-reward Pareto front, achieving superior rewards at fixed KL. Experiments with GEMMA policies validate that WARP improves their quality and alignment, outperforming other open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>OlympicArena Medal Ranks: Who Is the Most Intelligent AI So Far?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we pose the following question: Who is the most intelligent AI model to date, as measured by the OlympicArena (an Olympic-level, multi-discipline, multi-modal benchmark for superintelligent AI)? We specifically focus on the most recently released models: Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and GPT-4o. For the first time, we propose using an Olympic medal Table approach to rank AI models based on their comprehensive performance across various disciplines. Empirical results reveal: (1) Claude-3.5-Sonnet shows highly competitive overall performance over GPT-4o, even surpassing GPT-4o on a few subjects (i.e., Physics, Chemistry, and Biology). (2) Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4V are ranked consecutively just behind GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, but with a clear performance gap between them. (3) The performance of AI models from the open-source community significantly lags behind these proprietary models. (4) The performance of these models on this benchmark has been less than satisfactory, indicating that we still have a long way to go before achieving superintelligence. We remain committed to continuously tracking and evaluating the performance of the latest powerful models on this benchmark (available at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/OlympicArena).</description>

      <title>Blending LLMs into Cascaded Speech Translation: KIT's Offline Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently under exploration for various tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Machine Translation (MT), and even End-to-End Speech Translation (ST). In this paper, we present KIT's offline submission in the constrained + LLM track by incorporating recently proposed techniques that can be added to any cascaded speech translation. Specifically, we integrate Mistral-7B\footnote{mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1} into our system to enhance it in two ways. Firstly, we refine the ASR outputs by utilizing the N-best lists generated by our system and fine-tuning the LLM to predict the transcript accurately. Secondly, we refine the MT outputs at the document level by fine-tuning the LLM, leveraging both ASR and MT predictions to improve translation quality. We find that integrating the LLM into the ASR and MT systems results in an absolute improvement of $0.3\%$ in Word Error Rate and $0.65\%$ in COMET for tst2019 test set. In challenging test sets with overlapping speakers and background noise, we find that integrating LLM is not beneficial due to poor ASR performance. Here, we use ASR with chunked long-form decoding to improve context usage that may be unavailable when transcribing with Voice Activity Detection segmentation alone.</description>

Abstract: Instruction finetuning (IFT) is critical for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions. Numerous effective IFT datasets have been proposed in the recent past, but most focus on high resource languages such as English. In this work, we propose a fully synthetic, novel taxonomy (Evol) guided Multilingual, Multi-turn instruction finetuning dataset, called M2Lingual, to better align LLMs on a diverse set of languages and tasks. M2Lingual contains a total of 182K IFT pairs that are built upon diverse seeds, covering 70 languages, 17 NLP tasks and general instruction-response pairs. LLMs finetuned with M2Lingual substantially outperform the majority of existing multilingual IFT datasets. Importantly, LLMs trained with M2Lingual consistently achieve competitive results across a wide variety of evaluation benchmarks compared to existing multilingual IFT datasets. Specifically, LLMs finetuned with M2Lingual achieve strong performance on our translated multilingual, multi-turn evaluation benchmark as well as a wide variety of multilingual tasks. Thus we contribute, and the 2 step Evol taxonomy used for its creation. M2Lingual repository - https://huggingface.co/datasets/ServiceNow-AI/M2Lingual</description>

      <title>The Progression of Transformers from Language to Vision to MOT: A Literature Review on Multi-Object Tracking with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformer neural network architecture allows for autoregressive sequence-to-sequence modeling through the use of attention layers. It was originally created with the application of machine translation but has revolutionized natural language processing. Recently, transformers have also been applied across a wide variety of pattern recognition tasks, particularly in computer vision. In this literature review, we describe major advances in computer vision utilizing transformers. We then focus specifically on Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) and discuss how transformers are increasingly becoming competitive in state-of-the-art MOT works, yet still lag behind traditional deep learning methods.</description>

      <title>Adam-mini: Use Fewer Learning Rates To Gain More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16793v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Adam-mini, an optimizer that achieves on-par or better performance than AdamW with 45% to 50% less memory footprint. Adam-mini reduces memory by cutting down the number of learning rates in Adam: Instead of assigning an individual learning rate for each parameter using $1/\sqrt{v}$, Adam-mini uses the average of $v$ within a pre-defined parameter block as the learning rate for that block. Such a design is inspired by two empirical findings. First, the Hessian of Transformers exhibits a near-block diagonal structure with different sizes of dense sub-blocks. Second, for each of these dense sub-blocks, there exists a single high-quality learning rate that can outperform Adam, provided that sufficient resources are available to search it out. Adam-mini provides one cost-effective way to find these good learning rates and manage to cut down $\geq$ 90% $v$ in Adam. Empirically, we verify that Adam-mini performs on par or better than AdamW on various language models sized from 125M to 7B for pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF. The reduced memory footprint of Adam-mini also alleviates communication overheads among GPUs and CPUs, thereby increasing throughput. For instance, Adam-mini achieves 49.6% higher throughput than AdamW when pre-training Llama2-7B on 2x A800-80GB GPUs, which saves 33% wall-clock time for pre-training.</description>

      <title>Lottery Ticket Adaptation: Mitigating Destructive Interference in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16797v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for adapting large language models (LLMs) to new tasks are not suited to multi-task adaptation because they modify all the model weights -- causing destructive interference between tasks. The resulting effects, such as catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, make it challenging to obtain good performance on multiple tasks at the same time. To mitigate this, we propose Lottery Ticket Adaptation (LoTA), a sparse adaptation method that identifies and optimizes only a sparse subnetwork of the model. We evaluate LoTA on a wide range of challenging tasks such as instruction following, reasoning, math, and summarization. LoTA obtains better performance than full fine-tuning and low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and maintains good performance even after training on other tasks -- thus, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. By extracting and fine-tuning over lottery tickets (or sparse task vectors), LoTA also enables model merging over highly dissimilar tasks. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/kiddyboots216/lottery-ticket-adaptation.</description>

      <title>PISTOL: Dataset Compilation Pipeline for Structural Unlearning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, machine unlearning, which seeks to erase specific data stored in the pre-trained or fine-tuned models, has emerged as a crucial protective measure for LLMs. However, unlearning approaches for LLMs that have been considered thus far have focused on the removal of independent data points and have not taken into account that the stored facts are logically connected to one another and form an implicit knowledge graph. To facilitate the development of structural unlearning methods, which are essential for the practical application of unlearning, we propose PISTOL, a pipeline for compiling multi-scenario datasets for benchmarking structural LLM unlearning. Additionally, leveraging sample datasets synthesized using PISTOL, we conducted benchmarks with four distinct unlearning methods on both Llama2-7B and Mistral-7B models. This analysis helps to illustrate the prevailing challenges in effectively and robustly removing highly inter-connected data, batched data, or data skewed towards a specific domain. It also highlights the choice of pre-trained model can impact unlearning performance. This work not only advances our understandings on the limitation of current LLMs unlearning methods and proposes future research directions, but also provides a replicable framework for ongoing exploration and validation in the field.</description>

      <title>General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) focuses on generating valid ligands that strongly and specifically bind to a designated protein pocket. Several methods use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space, conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of atomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly consider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free energy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand and protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement. BADGER is a general guidance method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina (ADV). ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor. By using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained diffusion model. We show that our method improves the binding affinity of generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly surpassing previous machine learning methods. We also show that our guidance method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD frameworks.</description>

      <title>Ragnar\"ok: A Reusable RAG Framework and Baselines for TREC 2024 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Did you try out the new Bing Search? Or maybe you fiddled around with Google AI~Overviews? These might sound familiar because the modern-day search stack has recently evolved to include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. They allow searching and incorporating real-time data into large language models (LLMs) to provide a well-informed, attributed, concise summary in contrast to the traditional search paradigm that relies on displaying a ranked list of documents. Therefore, given these recent advancements, it is crucial to have an arena to build, test, visualize, and systematically evaluate RAG-based search systems. With this in mind, we propose the TREC 2024 RAG Track to foster innovation in evaluating RAG systems. In our work, we lay out the steps we've made towards making this track a reality -- we describe the details of our reusable framework, Ragnar\"ok, explain the curation of the new MS MARCO V2.1 collection choice, release the development topics for the track, and standardize the I/O definitions which assist the end user. Next, using Ragnar\"ok, we identify and provide key industrial baselines such as OpenAI's GPT-4o or Cohere's Command R+. Further, we introduce a web-based user interface for an interactive arena allowing benchmarking pairwise RAG systems by crowdsourcing. We open-source our Ragnar\"ok framework and baselines to achieve a unified standard for future RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Tokenization Bias in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art language models are autoregressive and operate on subword units known as tokens. Specifically, one must encode the conditioning string into a list of tokens before passing to the language models for next-token prediction. We show that, for encoding schemes such as maximum prefix matching, tokenization induces a sampling bias that cannot be mitigated with more training or data. To counter this universal problem, we propose a novel algorithm to obtain unbiased estimates from a model that was trained on tokenized data. Our method does not require finetuning the model, and its complexity, defined as the number of model runs, scales linearly with the sequence length. As a consequence, we show that one can simulate token-free behavior from a tokenized language model. We empirically verify the correctness of our method through a Markov-chain setup, where it accurately recovers the transition probabilities, as opposed to the conventional method of directly prompting tokens into the language model.</description>

      <title>USDC: A Dataset of $\underline{U}$ser $\underline{S}$tance and $\underline{D}$ogmatism in Long $\underline{C}$onversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying user's opinions and stances in long conversation threads on various topics can be extremely critical for enhanced personalization, market research, political campaigns, customer service, conflict resolution, targeted advertising, and content moderation. Hence, training language models to automate this task is critical. However, to train such models, gathering manual annotations has multiple challenges: 1) It is time-consuming and costly; 2) Conversation threads could be very long, increasing chances of noisy annotations; and 3) Interpreting instances where a user changes their opinion within a conversation is difficult because often such transitions are subtle and not expressed explicitly. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) for complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we leverage Mistral Large and GPT-4 to automate the human annotation process on the following two tasks while also providing reasoning: i) User Stance classification, which involves labeling a user's stance of a post in a conversation on a five-point scale; ii) User Dogmatism classification, which deals with labeling a user's overall opinion in the conversation on a four-point scale. The majority voting on zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot annotations from these two LLMs on 764 multi-user Reddit conversations helps us curate the USDC dataset. USDC is then used to finetune and instruction-tune multiple deployable small language models for the 5-class stance and 4-class dogmatism classification tasks. We make the code and dataset publicly available [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/USDC-0F7F].</description>

      <title>Losing Visual Needles in Image Haystacks: Vision Language Models are Easily Distracted in Short and Long Contexts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LoCoVQA, a dynamic benchmark generator for evaluating long-context extractive reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). LoCoVQA augments test examples for mathematical reasoning, VQA, and character recognition tasks with increasingly long visual contexts composed of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution distractor images.
  Across these tasks, a diverse set of VLMs rapidly lose performance as the visual context length grows, often exhibiting a striking exponential decay trend. This test assesses how well VLMs can ignore irrelevant information when answering queries -- a task that is quite easy for language models (LMs) in the text domain -- demonstrating that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack this essential capability for many long-context applications.</description>

      <title>GeoMFormer: A General Architecture for Geometric Molecular Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular modeling, a central topic in quantum mechanics, aims to accurately calculate the properties and simulate the behaviors of molecular systems. The molecular model is governed by physical laws, which impose geometric constraints such as invariance and equivariance to coordinate rotation and translation. While numerous deep learning approaches have been developed to learn molecular representations under these constraints, most of them are built upon heuristic and costly modules. We argue that there is a strong need for a general and flexible framework for learning both invariant and equivariant features. In this work, we introduce a novel Transformer-based molecular model called GeoMFormer to achieve this goal. Using the standard Transformer modules, two separate streams are developed to maintain and learn invariant and equivariant representations. Carefully designed cross-attention modules bridge the two streams, allowing information fusion and enhancing geometric modeling in each stream. As a general and flexible architecture, we show that many previous architectures can be viewed as special instantiations of GeoMFormer. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the power of GeoMFormer. All empirical results show that GeoMFormer achieves strong performance on both invariant and equivariant tasks of different types and scales. Code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/c-tl/GeoMFormer.</description>

      <title>StableNormal: Reducing Diffusion Variance for Stable and Sharp Normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of high-quality surface normal estimation from monocular colored inputs (i.e., images and videos), a field which has recently been revolutionized by repurposing diffusion priors. However, previous attempts still struggle with stochastic inference, conflicting with the deterministic nature of the Image2Normal task, and costly ensembling step, which slows down the estimation process. Our method, StableNormal, mitigates the stochasticity of the diffusion process by reducing inference variance, thus producing "Stable-and-Sharp" normal estimates without any additional ensembling process. StableNormal works robustly under challenging imaging conditions, such as extreme lighting, blurring, and low quality. It is also robust against transparent and reflective surfaces, as well as cluttered scenes with numerous objects. Specifically, StableNormal employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, which starts with a one-step normal estimator (YOSO) to derive an initial normal guess, that is relatively coarse but reliable, then followed by a semantic-guided refinement process (SG-DRN) that refines the normals to recover geometric details. The effectiveness of StableNormal is demonstrated through competitive performance in standard datasets such as DIODE-indoor, iBims, ScannetV2 and NYUv2, and also in various downstream tasks, such as surface reconstruction and normal enhancement. These results evidence that StableNormal retains both the "stability" and "sharpness" for accurate normal estimation. StableNormal represents a baby attempt to repurpose diffusion priors for deterministic estimation. To democratize this, code and models have been publicly available in hf.co/Stable-X</description>

      <title>GPTFUZZER: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Auto-Generated Jailbreak Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced tremendous popularity and are widely used from casual conversations to AI-driven programming. However, despite their considerable success, LLMs are not entirely reliable and can give detailed guidance on how to conduct harmful or illegal activities. While safety measures can reduce the risk of such outputs, adversarial jailbreak attacks can still exploit LLMs to produce harmful content. These jailbreak templates are typically manually crafted, making large-scale testing challenging.
  In this paper, we introduce GPTFuzz, a novel black-box jailbreak fuzzing framework inspired by the AFL fuzzing framework. Instead of manual engineering, GPTFuzz automates the generation of jailbreak templates for red-teaming LLMs. At its core, GPTFuzz starts with human-written templates as initial seeds, then mutates them to produce new templates. We detail three key components of GPTFuzz: a seed selection strategy for balancing efficiency and variability, mutate operators for creating semantically equivalent or similar sentences, and a judgment model to assess the success of a jailbreak attack.
  We evaluate GPTFuzz against various commercial and open-source LLMs, including ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Vicuna, under diverse attack scenarios. Our results indicate that GPTFuzz consistently produces jailbreak templates with a high success rate, surpassing human-crafted templates. Remarkably, GPTFuzz achieves over 90% attack success rates against ChatGPT and Llama-2 models, even with suboptimal initial seed templates. We anticipate that GPTFuzz will be instrumental for researchers and practitioners in examining LLM robustness and will encourage further exploration into enhancing LLM safety.</description>

      <title>Open Models, Closed Minds? On Agents Capabilities in Mimicking Human Personalities through Open Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of unveiling human-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a closer connection between NLP and human psychology. Scholars have been studying the inherent personalities exhibited by LLMs and attempting to incorporate human traits and behaviors into them. However, these efforts have primarily focused on commercially-licensed LLMs, neglecting the widespread use and notable advancements seen in Open LLMs. This work aims to address this gap by employing a set of 12 LLM Agents based on the most representative Open models and subject them to a series of assessments concerning the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) test. Our approach involves evaluating the intrinsic personality traits of Open LLM agents and determining the extent to which these agents can mimic human personalities when conditioned by specific personalities and roles. Our findings unveil that $(i)$ each Open LLM agent showcases distinct human personalities; $(ii)$ personality-conditioned prompting produces varying effects on the agents, with only few successfully mirroring the imposed personality, while most of them being ``closed-minded'' (i.e., they retain their intrinsic traits); and $(iii)$ combining role and personality conditioning can enhance the agents' ability to mimic human personalities. Our work represents a step up in understanding the dense relationship between NLP and human psychology through the lens of Open LLMs.</description>

      <title>Prompting with Divide-and-Conquer Program Makes Large Language Models Discerning to Hallucination and Deception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05359v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models, such as Large language Models (LLMs), have attracted significant amount of interest due to their large number of applications. However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, simple instructional prompts suffer from inaccurate responses. Existing works show that more complicated prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. Recent researches reveal that simple divide-and-conquer prompting strategy, i.e. simply dividing the input sequence to multiple sub-inputs, can also substantially improve LLM's performance in some specific tasks such as misinformation detection. In this paper, we aim at examining the utility of divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee. We then present two cases (large integer arithmetic and fact verification) where experimental results aligns with our theoretic analysis.</description>

      <title>Generation of Asset Administration Shell with Large Language Model Agents: Toward Semantic Interoperability in Digital Twins in the Context of Industry 4.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17209v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach for achieving semantic interoperability in digital twins and assisting the creation of Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as digital twin model within the context of Industry 4.0. The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on semantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked, and we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information can be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a "semantic node" data structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process the "semantic node" and generate standardized digital twin models from raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be translated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the generative capability of large language models. This result has a direct application in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is implemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in creating AAS model. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting technical concepts and translating data. Our findings emphasize LLMs' capability to automate AAS instance creation and contribute to the broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial applications. The prototype implementation and evaluation results are presented on our GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YuchenXia/AASbyLLM.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Safety: A Descendant of Generative AI and Control Systems Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is interacting with people at an unprecedented scale, offering new avenues for immense positive impact, but also raising widespread concerns around the potential for individual and societal harm. Today, the predominant paradigm for human--AI safety focuses on fine-tuning the generative model's outputs to better agree with human-provided examples or feedback. In reality, however, the consequences of an AI model's outputs cannot be determined in isolation: they are tightly entangled with the responses and behavior of human users over time. In this paper, we distill key complementary lessons from AI safety and control systems safety, highlighting open challenges as well as key synergies between both fields. We then argue that meaningful safety assurances for advanced AI technologies require reasoning about how the feedback loop formed by AI outputs and human behavior may drive the interaction towards different outcomes. To this end, we introduce a unifying formalism to capture dynamic, safety-critical human--AI interactions and propose a concrete technical roadmap towards next-generation human-centered AI safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation model-enabled generative artificial intelligence facilitates the development and implementation of agents, which can leverage distinguished reasoning and language processing capabilities to takes a proactive, autonomous role to pursue users' goals. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners in designing the agents considering challenges of goal-seeking (including generating instrumental goals and plans), such as hallucinations inherent in foundation models, explainability of reasoning process, complex accountability, etc. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art foundation model-based agents and the broader ecosystem. In this paper, we present a pattern catalogue consisting of 17 architectural patterns with analyses of the context, forces, and trade-offs as the outcomes from the previous literature review. The proposed catalogue can provide holistic guidance for the effective use of patterns, and support the architecture design of foundation model-based agents by facilitating goal-seeking and plan generation.</description>

      <title>On Creativity and Open-Endedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Life (ALife) as an interdisciplinary field draws inspiration and influence from a variety of perspectives. Scientific progress crucially depends, then, on concerted efforts to invite cross-disciplinary dialogue. The goal of this paper is to revitalize discussions of potential connections between the fields of Computational Creativity (CC) and ALife, focusing specifically on the concept of Open-Endedness (OE); the primary goal of CC is to endow artificial systems with creativity, and ALife has dedicated much research effort into studying and synthesizing OE and artificial innovation. However, despite the close proximity of these concepts, their use so far remains confined to their respective communities, and their relationship is largely unclear. We provide historical context for research in both domains, and review the limited work connecting research on creativity and OE explicitly. We then highlight specific questions to be considered, with the eventual goals of (i) decreasing conceptual ambiguity by highlighting similarities and differences between the concepts of OE and creativity, (ii) identifying synergy effects of a research agenda that encompasses both concepts, and (iii) establishing a dialogue between ALife and CC research.</description>

      <title>Flow of Reasoning: Efficient Training of LLM Policy with Divergent Thinking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Divergent thinking, the cognitive process of generating diverse solutions, is a hallmark of human creativity and problem-solving. For machines, sampling diverse solution trajectories in complex reasoning problems is crucial for robust outcomes, data augmentation, and enhanced model generalization. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with generating high-quality, diverse reasoning. While supervised fine-tuning helps with quality, it requires extensive supervision data to capture the full diversity of solutions. Alternatively, reinforcement learning methods like PPO aim to find limited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity, akin to convergent thinking. To address these limitations, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR) -- an efficient LLM training approach enabling diverse reasoning with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow from an initial state to terminal states. The formulation allows to adapt principled GFlowNet approaches to train the LLM as a policy, which is able to sample multiple reasoning paths with probabilities proportional to the unnormalized reward. Empirical results show that, with limited training data (e.g., 15 examples), FoR can discover diverse high-quality solutions that excel greatly beyond current state-of-the-art methods across three tasks, including embodied reasoning (BlocksWorld), math puzzle solving (Game24), and logical reasoning (PrOntoQA).

      <title>WeatherQA: Can Multimodal Language Models Reason about Severe Weather?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Severe convective weather events, such as hail, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, often occur quickly yet cause significant damage, costing billions of dollars every year. This highlights the importance of forecasting severe weather threats hours in advance to better prepare meteorologists and residents in at-risk areas. Can modern large foundation models perform such forecasting? Existing weather benchmarks typically focus only on predicting time-series changes in certain weather parameters (e.g., temperature, moisture) with text-only features. In this work, we introduce WeatherQA, the first multimodal dataset designed for machines to reason about complex combinations of weather parameters (a.k.a., ingredients) and predict severe weather in real-world scenarios. The dataset includes over 8,000 (multi-images, text) pairs for diverse severe weather events. Each pair contains rich information crucial for forecasting -- the images describe the ingredients capturing environmental instability, surface observations, and radar reflectivity, and the text contains forecast analyses written by human experts. With WeatherQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision language models, including GPT4, Claude3.5, Gemini-1.5, and a fine-tuned Llama3-based VLM, by designing two challenging tasks: (1) multi-choice QA for predicting affected area and (2) classification of the development potential of severe convection. These tasks require deep understanding of domain knowledge (e.g., atmospheric dynamics) and complex reasoning over multimodal data (e.g., interactions between weather parameters). We show a substantial gap between the strongest VLM, GPT4o, and human reasoning. Our comprehensive case study with meteorologists further reveals the weaknesses of the models, suggesting that better training and data integration are necessary to bridge this gap.

      <title>Interpretable Catastrophic Forgetting of Large Language Model Fine-tuning via Instruction Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can cause them to lose their general capabilities. However, the intrinsic mechanisms behind such forgetting remain unexplored. In this paper, we begin by examining this phenomenon by focusing on knowledge understanding and instruction following, with the latter identified as the main contributor to forgetting during fine-tuning. Consequently, we propose the Instruction Vector (IV) framework to capture model representations highly related to specific instruction-following capabilities, thereby making it possible to understand model-intrinsic forgetting. Through the analysis of IV dynamics pre and post-training, we suggest that fine-tuning mostly adds specialized reasoning patterns instead of erasing previous skills, which may appear as forgetting. Building on this insight, we develop IV-guided training, which aims to preserve original computation graph, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Empirical tests on three benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this new approach, supporting the relationship between IVs and forgetting. Our code will be made available soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Travel choice analysis is crucial for understanding individual travel behavior to develop appropriate transport policies and recommendation systems in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Despite extensive research, this domain faces two critical challenges: a) modeling with limited survey data, and b) simultaneously achieving high model explainability and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel prompt-learning-based Large Language Model(LLM) framework that significantly improves prediction accuracy and provides explicit explanations for individual predictions. This framework involves three main steps: transforming input variables into textual form; building of demonstrations similar to the object, and applying these to a well-trained LLM. We tested the framework's efficacy using two widely used choice datasets: London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC) and Optima-Mode collected in Switzerland. The results indicate that the LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods and discrete choice models in predicting people's choices. Additionally, we present a case of explanation illustrating how the LLM framework generates understandable and explicit explanations at the individual level.</description>

      <title>Q*: Improving Multi-step Reasoning for LLMs with Deliberative Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in many natural language tasks. However, the auto-regressive generation process makes LLMs prone to produce errors, hallucinations and inconsistent statements when performing multi-step reasoning. In this paper, by casting multi-step reasoning of LLMs as a heuristic search problem, we aim to alleviate the pathology by introducing Q*, a general, versatile and agile framework for guiding LLMs decoding process with deliberative planning. By learning a plug-and-play Q-value model as heuristic function for estimating expected future rewards, our Q* can effectively guide LLMs to select the most promising next reasoning step without fine-tuning LLMs for the current task, which avoids the significant computational overhead and potential risk of performance degeneration on other tasks. Extensive experiments on GSM8K, MATH and MBPP demonstrate the superiority of our method, contributing to improving the reasoning performance of existing open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>iWISDM: Assessing instruction following in multimodal models at scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to perform complex tasks from detailed instructions is a key to many remarkable achievements of our species. As humans, we are not only capable of performing a wide variety of tasks but also very complex ones that may entail hundreds or thousands of steps to complete. Large language models and their more recent multimodal counterparts that integrate textual and visual inputs have achieved unprecedented success in performing complex tasks. Yet, most existing benchmarks are largely confined to single-modality inputs (either text or vision), narrowing the scope of multimodal assessments, particularly for instruction-following in multimodal contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce the instructed-Virtual VISual Decision Making (iWISDM) environment engineered to generate a limitless array of vision-language tasks of varying complexity. Using iWISDM, we compiled three distinct benchmarks of instruction following visual tasks across varying complexity levels and evaluated several newly developed multimodal models on these benchmarks. Our findings establish iWISDM as a robust benchmark for assessing the instructional adherence of both existing and emergent multimodal models and highlight a large gap between these models' ability to precisely follow instructions with that of humans.The code of iWISDM is available on GitHub at https://github.com/BashivanLab/iWISDM.</description>

      <title>GIEBench: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Group Identity-based Empathy for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to develop and gain widespread application, the ability of LLMs to exhibit empathy towards diverse group identities and understand their perspectives is increasingly recognized as critical. Most existing benchmarks for empathy evaluation of LLMs focus primarily on universal human emotions, such as sadness and pain, often overlooking the context of individuals' group identities. To address this gap, we introduce GIEBench, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 11 identity dimensions, covering 97 group identities with a total of 999 single-choice questions related to specific group identities. GIEBench is designed to evaluate the empathy of LLMs when presented with specific group identities such as gender, age, occupation, and race, emphasizing their ability to respond from the standpoint of the identified group. This supports the ongoing development of empathetic LLM applications tailored to users with different identities. Our evaluation of 23 LLMs revealed that while these LLMs understand different identity standpoints, they fail to consistently exhibit equal empathy across these identities without explicit instructions to adopt those perspectives. This highlights the need for improved alignment of LLMs with diverse values to better accommodate the multifaceted nature of human identities. Our datasets are available at https://github.com/GIEBench/GIEBench.</description>

      <title>Investigating the impact of 2D gesture representation on co-speech gesture generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Co-speech gestures play a crucial role in the interactions between humans and embodied conversational agents (ECA). Recent deep learning methods enable the generation of realistic, natural co-speech gestures synchronized with speech, but such approaches require large amounts of training data. "In-the-wild" datasets, which compile videos from sources such as YouTube through human pose detection models, offer a solution by providing 2D skeleton sequences that are paired with speech. Concurrently, innovative lifting models have emerged, capable of transforming these 2D pose sequences into their 3D counterparts, leading to large and diverse datasets of 3D gestures. However, the derived 3D pose estimation is essentially a pseudo-ground truth, with the actual ground truth being the 2D motion data. This distinction raises questions about the impact of gesture representation dimensionality on the quality of generated motions, a topic that, to our knowledge, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the dimensionality of the training data, 2D or 3D joint coordinates, on the performance of a multimodal speech-to-gesture deep generative model. We use a lifting model to convert 2D-generated sequences of body pose to 3D. Then, we compare the sequence of gestures generated directly in 3D to the gestures generated in 2D and lifted to 3D as post-processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretability is a key requirement for the use of machine learning models in high-stakes applications, including medical diagnosis. Explaining black-box models mostly relies on post-hoc methods that do not faithfully reflect the model's behavior. As a remedy, prototype-based networks have been proposed, but their interpretability is limited as they have been shown to provide coarse, unreliable, and imprecise explanations. In this work, we introduce Proto-BagNets, an interpretable-by-design prototype-based model that combines the advantages of bag-of-local feature models and prototype learning to provide meaningful, coherent, and relevant prototypical parts needed for accurate and interpretable image classification tasks. We evaluated the Proto-BagNet for drusen detection on publicly available retinal OCT data. The Proto-BagNet performed comparably to the state-of-the-art interpretable and non-interpretable models while providing faithful, accurate, and clinically meaningful local and global explanations. The code is available at https://github.com/kdjoumessi/Proto-BagNets.</description>

      <title>Expert Q-learning: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Coarse State Values from Offline Expert Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.14642v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel algorithm for deep reinforcement learning named Expert Q-learning. Expert Q-learning is inspired by Dueling Q-learning and aims at incorporating semi-supervised learning into reinforcement learning through splitting Q-values into state values and action advantages. We require that an offline expert assesses the value of a state in a coarse manner using three discrete values. An expert network is designed in addition to the Q-network, which updates each time following the regular offline minibatch update whenever the expert example buffer is not empty. Using the board game Othello, we compare our algorithm with the baseline Q-learning algorithm, which is a combination of Double Q-learning and Dueling Q-learning. Our results show that Expert Q-learning is indeed useful and more resistant to the overestimation bias. The baseline Q-learning algorithm exhibits unstable and suboptimal behavior in non-deterministic settings, whereas Expert Q-learning demonstrates more robust performance with higher scores, illustrating that our algorithm is indeed suitable to integrate state values from expert examples into Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Improving the Diversity of Bootstrapped DQN by Replacing Priors With Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01004</link>

Abstract: Q-learning is one of the most well-known Reinforcement Learning algorithms. There have been tremendous efforts to develop this algorithm using neural networks. Bootstrapped Deep Q-Learning Network is amongst them. It utilizes multiple neural network heads to introduce diversity into Q-learning. Diversity can sometimes be viewed as the amount of reasonable moves an agent can take at a given state, analogous to the definition of the exploration ratio in RL. Thus, the performance of Bootstrapped Deep Q-Learning Network is deeply connected with the level of diversity within the algorithm. In the original research, it was pointed out that a random prior could improve the performance of the model. In this article, we further explore the possibility of replacing priors with noise and sample the noise from a Gaussian distribution to introduce more diversity into this algorithm. We conduct our experiment on the Atari benchmark and compare our algorithm to both the original and other related algorithms. The results show that our modification of the Bootstrapped Deep Q-Learning algorithm achieves significantly higher evaluation scores across different types of Atari games. Thus, we conclude that replacing priors with noise can improve Bootstrapped Deep Q-Learning's performance by ensuring the integrity of diversities.</description>

      <title>A Non-autoregressive Multi-Horizon Flight Trajectory Prediction Framework with Gray Code Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01658</link>

Abstract: Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC), which can assist air traffic controllers in managing airspace more safely and efficiently. Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Low-Resource Multi-Granularity Academic Function Recognition Based on Multiple Prompt Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs), e.g., SciBERT, generally requires large numbers of annotated data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of NLP tasks in the scientific domain. However, obtaining the fine-tune data for scientific NLP task is still challenging and expensive. Inspired by recent advancement in prompt learning, in this paper, we propose the Mix Prompt Tuning (MPT), which is a semi-supervised method to alleviate the dependence on annotated data and improve the performance of multi-granularity academic function recognition tasks with a small number of labeled examples. Specifically, the proposed method provides multi-perspective representations by combining manual prompt templates with automatically learned continuous prompt templates to help the given academic function recognition task take full advantage of knowledge in PLMs. Based on these prompt templates and the fine-tuned PLM, a large number of pseudo labels are assigned to the unlabeled examples. Finally, we fine-tune the PLM using the pseudo training set. We evaluate our method on three academic function recognition tasks of different granularity including the citation function, the abstract sentence function, and the keyword function, with datasets from computer science domain and biomedical domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and statistically significant improvements against strong baselines. In particular, it achieves an average increase of 5% in Macro-F1 score compared with fine-tuning, and 6% in Macro-F1 score compared with other semi-supervised method under low-resource settings. In addition, MPT is a general method that can be easily applied to other low-resource scientific classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) involves identifying the relations between entities from underlying content. RE serves as the foundation for many natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval applications, such as knowledge graph completion and question answering. In recent years, deep neural networks have dominated the field of RE and made noticeable progress. Subsequently, the large pre-trained language models have taken the state-of-the-art RE to a new level. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing deep learning techniques for RE. First, we introduce RE resources, including datasets and evaluation metrics. Second, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize existing works from three perspectives, i.e., text representation, context encoding, and triplet prediction. Third, we discuss several important challenges faced by RE and summarize potential techniques to tackle these challenges. Finally, we outline some promising future directions and prospects in this field. This survey is expected to facilitate researchers' collaborative efforts to address the challenges of real-world RE systems.</description>

      <title>On the Need of a Modeling Language for Distribution Shifts: Illustrations on Tabular Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different distribution shifts require different interventions, and algorithms must be grounded in the specific shifts they address. However, methodological development for ''robust'' methods typically relies on structural assumptions that lack empirical validation. Advocating for an empirically grounded inductive approach to research, we build an empirical testbed comprising natural shifts across 5 tabular datasets and 60,000 method configurations encompassing imbalanced learning methods and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) methods. We find $Y|X$-shifts are most prevalent on our testbed, in stark contrast to the heavy focus on $X$ (covariate)-shifts in the ML literature. The performance of ''robust'' methods varies significantly over shift types, and is no better than that of vanilla methods. To understand why, we conduct an in-depth empirical analysis of DRO methods and find that although often neglected by researchers, implementation details -- such as the choice of underlying model class (e.g., XGBoost) and hyperparameter selection -- have a bigger impact on performance than the ambiguity set or its radius. To further bridge that gap between methodological research and practice, we design case studies that illustrate how such a refined, inductive understanding of distribution shifts can enhance both data-centric and algorithmic interventions.</description>

      <title>EasyEdit: An Easy-to-use Knowledge Editing Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) usually suffer from knowledge cutoff or fallacy issues, which means they are unaware of unseen events or generate text with incorrect facts owing to outdated/noisy data. To this end, many knowledge editing approaches for LLMs have emerged -- aiming to subtly inject/edit updated knowledge or adjust undesired behavior while minimizing the impact on unrelated inputs. Nevertheless, due to significant differences among various knowledge editing methods and the variations in task setups, there is no standard implementation framework available for the community, which hinders practitioners from applying knowledge editing to applications. To address these issues, we propose EasyEdit, an easy-to-use knowledge editing framework for LLMs. It supports various cutting-edge knowledge editing approaches and can be readily applied to many well-known LLMs such as T5, GPT-J, LlaMA, etc. Empirically, we report the knowledge editing results on LlaMA-2 with EasyEdit, demonstrating that knowledge editing surpasses traditional fine-tuning in terms of reliability and generalization. We have released the source code on GitHub, along with Google Colab tutorials and comprehensive documentation for beginners to get started. Besides, we present an online system for real-time knowledge editing, and a demo video.</description>

      <title>ReLLa: Retrieval-enhanced Large Language Models for Lifelong Sequential Behavior Comprehension in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11131v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval-enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension. To be highlighted, with only less than 10% training samples, few-shot ReLLa can outperform traditional CTR models that are trained on the entire training set (e.g., DCNv2, DIN, SIM). The code is available \url{https://github.com/LaVieEnRose365/ReLLa}.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic space is becoming a popular choice for representing data due to the hierarchical structure - whether implicit or explicit - of many real-world datasets. Along with it comes a need for algorithms capable of solving fundamental tasks, such as classification, in hyperbolic space. Recently, multiple papers have investigated hyperbolic alternatives to hyperplane-based classifiers, such as logistic regression and SVMs. While effective, these approaches struggle with more complex hierarchical data. We, therefore, propose to generalize the well-known random forests to hyperbolic space. We do this by redefining the notion of a split using horospheres. Since finding the globally optimal split is computationally intractable, we find candidate horospheres through a large-margin classifier. To make hyperbolic random forests work on multi-class data and imbalanced experiments, we furthermore outline a new method for combining classes based on their lowest common ancestor and a class-balanced version of the large-margin loss. Experiments on standard and new benchmarks show that our approach outperforms both conventional random forest algorithms and recent hyperbolic classifiers.</description>

      <title>Unified and Dynamic Graph for Temporal Character Grouping in Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video temporal character grouping locates appearing moments of major characters within a video according to their identities. To this end, recent works have evolved from unsupervised clustering to graph-based supervised clustering. However, graph methods are built upon the premise of fixed affinity graphs, bringing many inexact connections. Besides, they extract multi-modal features with kinds of models, which are unfriendly to deployment. In this paper, we present a unified and dynamic graph (UniDG) framework for temporal character grouping. This is accomplished firstly by a unified representation network that learns representations of multiple modalities within the same space and still preserves the modality's uniqueness simultaneously. Secondly, we present a dynamic graph clustering where the neighbors of different quantities are dynamically constructed for each node via a cyclic matching strategy, leading to a more reliable affinity graph. Thirdly, a progressive association method is introduced to exploit spatial and temporal contexts among different modalities, allowing multi-modal clustering results to be well fused. As current datasets only provide pre-extracted features, we evaluate our UniDG method on a collected dataset named MTCG, which contains each character's appearing clips of face and body and speaking voice tracks. We also evaluate our key components on existing clustering and retrieval datasets to verify the generalization ability. Experimental results manifest that our method can achieve promising results and outperform several state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>LMDX: Language Model-based Document Information Extraction and Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), improving state-of-the-art and exhibiting emergent capabilities across various tasks. However, their application in extracting information from visually rich documents, which is at the core of many document processing workflows and involving the extraction of key entities from semi-structured documents, has not yet been successful. The main obstacles to adopting LLMs for this task include the absence of layout encoding within LLMs, which is critical for high quality extraction, and the lack of a grounding mechanism to localize the predicted entities within the document. In this paper, we introduce Language Model-based Document Information Extraction and Localization (LMDX), a methodology to reframe the document information extraction task for a LLM. LMDX enables extraction of singular, repeated, and hierarchical entities, both with and without training data, while providing grounding guarantees and localizing the entities within the document. Finally, we apply LMDX to the PaLM 2-S and Gemini Pro LLMs and evaluate it on VRDU and CORD benchmarks, setting a new state-of-the-art and showing how LMDX enables the creation of high quality, data-efficient parsers.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Few-Shot Learning in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lack of annotated medical images limits the performance of deep learning models, which usually need large-scale labelled datasets. Few-shot learning techniques can reduce data scarcity issues and enhance medical image analysis, especially with meta-learning. This systematic review gives a comprehensive overview of few-shot learning in medical imaging. We searched the literature systematically and selected 80 relevant articles published from 2018 to 2023. We clustered the articles based on medical outcomes, such as tumour segmentation, disease classification, and image registration; anatomical structure investigated (i.e. heart, lung, etc.); and the meta-learning method used. For each cluster, we examined the papers' distributions and the results provided by the state-of-the-art. In addition, we identified a generic pipeline shared among all the studies. The review shows that few-shot learning can overcome data scarcity in most outcomes and that meta-learning is a popular choice to perform few-shot learning because it can adapt to new tasks with few labelled samples. In addition, following meta-learning, supervised learning and semi-supervised learning stand out as the predominant techniques employed to tackle few-shot learning challenges in medical imaging and also best performing. Lastly, we observed that the primary application areas predominantly encompass cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal domains. This systematic review aims to inspire further research to improve medical image analysis and patient care.</description>

      <title>ReConcile: Round-Table Conference Improves Reasoning via Consensus among Diverse LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with natural language reasoning tasks. Motivated by the society of minds (Minsky, 1988), we propose ReConcile, a multi-model multi-agent framework designed as a round table conference among diverse LLM agents. ReConcile enhances collaborative reasoning between LLM agents via multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism that leads to a better consensus. In each round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a 'discussion prompt' that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent in the previous round, (b) their confidence scores, and (c) demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly improves LLMs' reasoning -- both individually and as a team -- surpassing prior single-agent and multi-agent baselines by up to 11.4% and even outperforming GPT-4 on three datasets. ReConcile also flexibly incorporates different combinations of agents, including API-based, open-source, and domain-specific models, leading to an 8% improvement on MATH. Finally, we analyze the individual components of ReConcile, demonstrating that the diversity originating from different models is critical to its superior performance.

      <description>arXiv:2309.13160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become a cornerstone in generative modeling and representation learning within machine learning. This paper explores a nuanced aspect of VAEs, focusing on interpreting the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence, a critical component within the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) that governs the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and regularization. Meanwhile, the KL Divergence enforces alignment between latent variable distributions and a prior imposing a structure on the overall latent space but leaves individual variable distributions unconstrained. The proposed method redefines the ELBO with a mixture of Gaussians for the posterior probability, introduces a regularization term to prevent variance collapse, and employs a PatchGAN discriminator to enhance texture realism. Implementation details involve ResNetV2 architectures for both the Encoder and Decoder. The experiments demonstrate the ability to generate realistic faces, offering a promising solution for enhancing VAE-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Use Your INSTINCT: INSTruction optimization for LLMs usIng Neural bandits Coupled with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable instruction-following capabilities and achieved impressive performances in various applications. However, the performances of LLMs depend heavily on the instructions given to them, which are typically manually tuned with substantial human efforts. Recent work has used the query-efficient Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to automatically optimize the instructions given to black-box LLMs. However, BO usually falls short when optimizing highly sophisticated (e.g., high-dimensional) objective functions, such as the functions mapping an instruction to the performance of an LLM. This is mainly due to the limited expressive power of the Gaussian process (GP) which is used by BO as a surrogate to model the objective function. Meanwhile, it has been repeatedly shown that neural networks (NNs), especially pre-trained transformers, possess strong expressive power and can model highly complex functions. So, we adopt a neural bandit algorithm which replaces the GP in BO by an NN surrogate to optimize instructions for black-box LLMs. More importantly, the neural bandit algorithm allows us to naturally couple the NN surrogate with the hidden representation learned by a pre-trained transformer (i.e., an open-source LLM), which significantly boosts its performance. These motivate us to propose our INSTruction optimization usIng Neural bandits Coupled with Transformers (INSTINCT) algorithm. We perform instruction optimization for ChatGPT and use extensive experiments to show that INSTINCT consistently outperforms baselines in different tasks, e.g., various instruction induction tasks and the task of improving zero-shot chain-of-thought instructions.

      <title>Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Reward Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently emerged at the forefront of image generation, powered by very large-scale unsupervised or weakly supervised text-to-image training datasets. Due to their unsupervised training, controlling their behavior in downstream tasks, such as maximizing human-perceived image quality, image-text alignment, or ethical image generation, is difficult. Recent works finetune diffusion models to downstream reward functions using vanilla reinforcement learning, notorious for the high variance of the gradient estimators. In this paper, we propose AlignProp, a method that aligns diffusion models to downstream reward functions using end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient through the denoising process. While naive implementation of such backpropagation would require prohibitive memory resources for storing the partial derivatives of modern text-to-image models, AlignProp finetunes low-rank adapter weight modules and uses gradient checkpointing, to render its memory usage viable. We test AlignProp in finetuning diffusion models to various objectives, such as image-text semantic alignment, aesthetics, compressibility and controllability of the number of objects present, as well as their combinations. We show AlignProp achieves higher rewards in fewer training steps than alternatives, while being conceptually simpler, making it a straightforward choice for optimizing diffusion models for differentiable reward functions of interest.

      <title>Faithful Knowledge Graph Explanations for Commonsense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04910v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fusion of language models (LMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) is widely used in commonsense question answering, but generating faithful explanations remains challenging. Current methods often overlook path decoding faithfulness, leading to divergence between graph encoder outputs and model predictions. We identify confounding effects and LM-KG misalignment as key factors causing spurious explanations. To address this, we introduce the LM-KG Fidelity metric to assess KG representation reliability and propose the LM-KG Distribution-aware Alignment (\textit{LKDA}) algorithm to improve explanation faithfulness. Without ground truth, we evaluate KG explanations using the proposed Fidelity-Sparsity Trade-off Curve. Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA show that LKDA significantly enhances explanation fidelity and model performance, highlighting the need to address distributional misalignment for reliable commonsense reasoning.</description>

      <title>ClickPrompt: CTR Models are Strong Prompt Generators for Adapting Language Models to CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09234v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction has become increasingly indispensable for various Internet applications. Traditional CTR models convert the multi-field categorical data into ID features via one-hot encoding, and extract the collaborative signals among features. Such a paradigm suffers from the problem of semantic information loss. Another line of research explores the potential of pretrained language models (PLMs) for CTR prediction by converting input data into textual sentences through hard prompt templates. Although semantic signals are preserved, they generally fail to capture the collaborative information (e.g., feature interactions, pure ID features), not to mention the unacceptable inference overhead brought by the huge model size. In this paper, we aim to model both the semantic knowledge and collaborative knowledge for accurate CTR estimation, and meanwhile address the inference inefficiency issue. To benefit from both worlds and close their gaps, we propose a novel model-agnostic framework (i.e., ClickPrompt), where we incorporate CTR models to generate interaction-aware soft prompts for PLMs. We design a prompt-augmented masked language modeling (PA-MLM) pretraining task, where PLM has to recover the masked tokens based on the language context, as well as the soft prompts generated by CTR model. The collaborative and semantic knowledge from ID and textual features would be explicitly aligned and interacted via the prompt interface. Then, we can either tune the CTR model with PLM for superior performance, or solely tune the CTR model without PLM for inference efficiency. Experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of ClickPrompt compared with existing baselines.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning with Iterative Demonstration Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning ability via in-context learning (ICL). However, the performance of ICL has been shown to be highly sensitive to the selection of few-shot demonstrations. Selecting the most suitable examples as context remains an ongoing challenge and an open problem. Existing literature has highlighted the importance of selecting examples that are diverse or semantically similar to the test sample while ignoring the fact that the optimal selection dimension, i.e., diversity or similarity, is task-specific. Based on how the test sample is answered, we propose Iterative Demonstration Selection (IDS) to leverage the merits of both dimensions. Using zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT), IDS iteratively selects examples that are diverse but still strongly correlated with the test sample as ICL demonstrations. Specifically, IDS applies Zero-shot-CoT to the test sample before demonstration selection. The output reasoning path is then used to choose demonstrations that are prepended to the test sample for inference. The generated answer is followed by its corresponding reasoning path for extracting a new set of demonstrations in the next iteration. After several iterations, IDS adopts majority voting to obtain the final result. Through extensive experiments on tasks including reasoning, question answering, and topic classification, we demonstrate that IDS can consistently outperform existing ICL demonstration selection methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applications of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the field of Autonomous Driving (AD) have attracted widespread attention due to their outstanding performance and the ability to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating language data, driving systems can gain a better understanding of real-world environments, thereby enhancing driving safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic survey of the advances in vision language models in this domain, encompassing perception and understanding, navigation and planning, decision-making and control, end-to-end autonomous driving, and data generation. We introduce the mainstream VLM tasks in AD and the commonly utilized metrics. Additionally, we review current studies and applications in various areas and summarize the existing language-enhanced autonomous driving datasets thoroughly. Lastly, we discuss the benefits and challenges of VLMs in AD and provide researchers with the current research gaps and future trends.</description>

      <title>Functional Overlap Reranking for Neural Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) have ushered in a new era in code generation advancements. However, selecting the best code solutions from all possible CodeLLM outputs remains a challenge. Previous methods often overlooked the intricate functional similarities and interactions between solution clusters. We introduce SRank, a novel reranking strategy for selecting the best solutions from code generation, focusing on modeling the relationships between clusters of solutions. By quantifying the functional overlap between solution clusters, our approach provides a better ranking strategy for code solutions. Empirical results show that our method achieves remarkable results on the pass@1 score. For instance, on the Human-Eval benchmark, we achieve 69.66% in pass@1 with Codex002, 75.31% with WizardCoder, 53.99% with StarCoder, and 60.55% with CodeGen, surpassing state-of-the-art code generation reranking methods such as CodeT and Coder-Reviewer on the same CodeLLM by a significant margin (approximately 6.1% improvement on average). Even in scenarios with a limited number of sampled solutions and test cases, our approach demonstrates robustness and superiority, marking a new benchmark in code generation reranking. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/FSoft-AI4Code/SRank-CodeRanker.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Weak &amp; Strong Experts on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic graphs contain both (1) rich self-features of nodes and (2) informative structures of neighborhoods, jointly handled by a Graph Neural Network (GNN) in the typical setup. We propose to decouple the two modalities by Mixture of weak and strong experts (Mowst), where the weak expert is a light-weight Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and the strong expert is an off-the-shelf GNN. To adapt the experts' collaboration to different target nodes, we propose a "confidence" mechanism based on the dispersion of the weak expert's prediction logits. The strong expert is conditionally activated in the low-confidence region when either the node's classification relies on neighborhood information, or the weak expert has low model quality. We reveal interesting training dynamics by analyzing the influence of the confidence function on loss: our training algorithm encourages the specialization of each expert by effectively generating soft splitting of the graph. In addition, our "confidence" design imposes a desirable bias toward the strong expert to benefit from GNN's better generalization capability. Mowst is easy to optimize and achieves strong expressive power, with a computation cost comparable to a single GNN. Empirically, Mowst on 4 backbone GNN architectures show significant accuracy improvement on 6 standard node classification benchmarks, including both homophilous and heterophilous graphs (https://github.com/facebookresearch/mowst-gnn).</description>

Abstract: Online gender based violence has grown concomitantly with adoption of the internet and social media. Its effects are worse in the Global majority where many users use social media in languages other than English. The scale and volume of conversations on the internet has necessitated the need for automated detection of hate speech, and more specifically gendered abuse. There is, however, a lack of language specific and contextual data to build such automated tools. In this paper we present a dataset on gendered abuse in three languages- Hindi, Tamil and Indian English. The dataset comprises of tweets annotated along three questions pertaining to the experience of gender abuse, by experts who identify as women or a member of the LGBTQIA community in South Asia. Through this dataset we demonstrate a participatory approach to creating datasets that drive AI systems.</description>

      <title>Graph Elicitation for Guiding Multi-Step Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting along with sub-question generation and answering has enhanced multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prompting the LLMs to directly generate sub-questions is suboptimal since they sometimes generate redundant or irrelevant questions. To deal with them, we propose a GE-Reasoning method, which directs LLMs to generate proper sub-questions and corresponding answers. Concretely, given an input question, we first prompt the LLM to generate knowledge triplets, forming a graph representation of the question. Unlike conventional knowledge triplets, our approach allows variables as head or tail entities, effectively representing a question as knowledge triplets. Second, for each triplet, the LLM generates a corresponding sub-question and answer along with using knowledge retrieval. If the prediction confidence exceeds a threshold, the sub-question and prediction are incorporated into the prompt for subsequent processing. This approach encourages that sub-questions are grounded in the extracted knowledge triplets, reducing redundancy and irrelevance. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous CoT prompting methods and their variants on multi-hop question answering benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>RecExplainer: Aligning Large Language Models for Explaining Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are widely used in online services, with embedding-based models being particularly popular due to their expressiveness in representing complex signals. However, these models often function as a black box, making them less transparent and reliable for both users and developers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable intelligence in understanding, reasoning, and instruction following. This paper presents the initial exploration of using LLMs as surrogate models to explaining black-box recommender models. The primary concept involves training LLMs to comprehend and emulate the behavior of target recommender models. By leveraging LLMs' own extensive world knowledge and multi-step reasoning abilities, these aligned LLMs can serve as advanced surrogates, capable of reasoning about observations. Moreover, employing natural language as an interface allows for the creation of customizable explanations that can be adapted to individual user preferences. To facilitate an effective alignment, we introduce three methods: behavior alignment, intention alignment, and hybrid alignment. Behavior alignment operates in the language space, representing user preferences and item information as text to mimic the target model's behavior; intention alignment works in the latent space of the recommendation model, using user and item representations to understand the model's behavior; hybrid alignment combines both language and latent spaces. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our approach yields promising results in understanding and mimicking target models, producing high-quality, high-fidelity, and distinct explanations.

Abstract: As a communication channel, body movements have been widely explored in behavioral studies and kinesics. Performing and visual arts share the same interests but focus on documenting and representing human body movements, such as for dance notation and visual work creation. This paper investigates body movements in oriental calligraphy and how to apply calligraphy principles to stimulate and archive body movements. Through an artwork (Wushu), the authors experiment with an interactive and generative approach to engage the audience's bodily participation and archive the body movements as a compendium of generated calligraphy. The audience assumes the role of both writers and readers; creating ("writing") and appreciating ("reading") the generated calligraphy becomes a cyclical process within this infinite "Book," which can motivate further attention and discussions concerning Chinese characters and calligraphy.</description>

      <title>Potential Societal Biases of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose:Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, such as ChatGPT, may inherit or amplify societal biases due to their training on extensive datasets. With the increasing usage of GAI by students, faculty, and staff in higher education institutions (HEIs), it is urgent to examine the ethical issues and potential biases associated with these technologies. Design/Approach/Methods:This scoping review aims to elucidate how biases related to GAI in HEIs have been researched and discussed in recent academic publications. We categorized the potential societal biases that GAI might cause in the field of higher education. Our review includes articles written in English, Chinese, and Japanese across four main databases, focusing on GAI usage in higher education and bias. Findings:Our findings reveal that while there is meaningful scholarly discussion around bias and discrimination concerning LLMs in the AI field, most articles addressing higher education approach the issue superficially. Few articles identify specific types of bias under different circumstances, and there is a notable lack of empirical research. Most papers in our review focus primarily on educational and research fields related to medicine and engineering, with some addressing English education. However, there is almost no discussion regarding the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, a significant portion of the current discourse is in English and primarily addresses English-speaking contexts. Originality/Value:To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to summarize the potential societal biases in higher education. This review highlights the need for more in-depth studies and empirical work to understand the specific biases that GAI might introduce or amplify in educational settings, guiding the development of more ethical AI applications in higher education.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft sensors are crucial in bridging autonomous systems' physical and digital realms, enhancing sensor fusion and perception. Instead of deploying soft sensors on the Cloud, this study shift towards employing on-device soft sensors, promising heightened efficiency and bolstering data security. Our approach substantially improves energy efficiency by deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly on devices within a wireless sensor network. Furthermore, the synergistic integration of the Microcontroller Unit and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) leverages the rapid AI inference capabilities of the latter. Empirical evidence from our real-world use case demonstrates that FPGA-based soft sensors achieve inference times ranging remarkably from 1.04 to 12.04 microseconds. These compelling results highlight the considerable potential of our innovative approach for executing real-time inference tasks efficiently, thereby presenting a feasible alternative that effectively addresses the latency challenges intrinsic to Cloud-based deployments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models excel at creating images that closely mimic real scenes, suggesting they inherently encode scene representations. We introduce Intrinsic LoRA (I-LoRA), a general approach that uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to discover scene intrinsics such as normals, depth, albedo, and shading from a wide array of generative models. I-LoRA is lightweight, adding minimally to the model's parameters and requiring very small datasets for this knowledge discovery. Our approach, applicable to Diffusion models, GANs, and Autoregressive models alike, generates intrinsics using the same output head as the original images. Through control experiments, we establish a correlation between the generative model's quality and the extracted intrinsics' accuracy. Finally, scene intrinsics obtained by our method with just hundreds to thousands of labeled images, perform on par with those from supervised methods trained on millions of labeled examples.</description>

      <title>Advancing Surgical VQA with Scene Graph Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern operating room is becoming increasingly complex, requiring innovative intra-operative support systems. While the focus of surgical data science has largely been on video analysis, integrating surgical computer vision with language capabilities is emerging as a necessity. Our work aims to advance Visual Question Answering (VQA) in the surgical context with scene graph knowledge, addressing two main challenges in the current surgical VQA systems: removing question-condition bias in the surgical VQA dataset and incorporating scene-aware reasoning in the surgical VQA model design. First, we propose a Surgical Scene Graph-based dataset, SSG-QA, generated by employing segmentation and detection models on publicly available datasets. We build surgical scene graphs using spatial and action information of instruments and anatomies. These graphs are fed into a question engine, generating diverse QA pairs. Our SSG-QA dataset provides a more complex, diverse, geometrically grounded, unbiased, and surgical action-oriented dataset compared to existing surgical VQA datasets. We then propose SSG-QA-Net, a novel surgical VQA model incorporating a lightweight Scene-embedded Interaction Module (SIM), which integrates geometric scene knowledge in the VQA model design by employing cross-attention between the textual and the scene features. Our comprehensive analysis of the SSG-QA dataset shows that SSG-QA-Net outperforms existing methods across different question types and complexities. We highlight that the primary limitation in the current surgical VQA systems is the lack of scene knowledge to answer complex queries. We present a novel surgical VQA dataset and model and show that results can be significantly improved by incorporating geometric scene features in the VQA model design. The source code and the dataset will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/CAMMA-public/SSG-QA</description>

      <title>Visual Explanations of Image-Text Representations via Multi-Modal Information Bottleneck Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language pretrained models have seen remarkable success, but their application to safety-critical settings is limited by their lack of interpretability. To improve the interpretability of vision-language models such as CLIP, we propose a multi-modal information bottleneck (M2IB) approach that learns latent representations that compress irrelevant information while preserving relevant visual and textual features. We demonstrate how M2IB can be applied to attribution analysis of vision-language pretrained models, increasing attribution accuracy and improving the interpretability of such models when applied to safety-critical domains such as healthcare. Crucially, unlike commonly used unimodal attribution methods, M2IB does not require ground truth labels, making it possible to audit representations of vision-language pretrained models when multiple modalities but no ground-truth data is available. Using CLIP as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of M2IB attribution and show that it outperforms gradient-based, perturbation-based, and attention-based attribution methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Bringing Back the Context: Camera Trap Species Identification as Link Prediction on Multimodal Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00608v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Camera traps are valuable tools in animal ecology for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. However, challenges like poor generalization to deployment at new unseen locations limit their practical application. Images are naturally associated with heterogeneous forms of context possibly in different modalities. In this work, we leverage the structured context associated with the camera trap images to improve out-of-distribution generalization for the task of species identification in camera traps. For example, a photo of a wild animal may be associated with information about where and when it was taken, as well as structured biology knowledge about the animal species. While typically overlooked by existing work, bringing back such context offers several potential benefits for better image understanding, such as addressing data scarcity and enhancing generalization. However, effectively integrating such heterogeneous context into the visual domain is a challenging problem. To address this, we propose a novel framework that reformulates species classification as link prediction in a multimodal knowledge graph (KG). This framework seamlessly integrates various forms of multimodal context for visual recognition. We apply this framework for out-of-distribution species classification on the iWildCam2020-WILDS and Snapshot Mountain Zebra datasets and achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, our framework successfully incorporates biological taxonomy for improved generalization and enhances sample efficiency for recognizing under-represented species.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models, Image Super-Resolution And Everything: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have disrupted the image Super-Resolution (SR) field and further closed the gap between image quality and human perceptual preferences. They are easy to train and can produce very high-quality samples that exceed the realism of those produced by previous generative methods. Despite their promising results, they also come with new challenges that need further research: high computational demands, comparability, lack of explainability, color shifts, and more. Unfortunately, entry into this field is overwhelming because of the abundance of publications. To address this, we provide a unified recount of the theoretical foundations underlying DMs applied to image SR and offer a detailed analysis that underscores the unique characteristics and methodologies within this domain, distinct from broader existing reviews in the field. This survey articulates a cohesive understanding of DM principles and explores current research avenues, including alternative input domains, conditioning techniques, guidance mechanisms, corruption spaces, and zero-shot learning approaches. By offering a detailed examination of the evolution and current trends in image SR through the lens of DMs, this survey sheds light on the existing challenges and charts potential future directions, aiming to inspire further innovation in this rapidly advancing area.</description>

      <title>Graph2Tac: Online Representation Learning of Formal Math Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In proof assistants, the physical proximity between two formal mathematical concepts is a strong predictor of their mutual relevance. Furthermore, lemmas with close proximity regularly exhibit similar proof structures. We show that this locality property can be exploited through online learning techniques to obtain solving agents that far surpass offline learners when asked to prove theorems in an unseen mathematical setting. We extensively benchmark two such online solvers implemented in the Tactician platform for the Coq proof assistant: First, Tactician's online $k$-nearest neighbor solver, which can learn from recent proofs, shows a $1.72\times$ improvement in theorems proved over an offline equivalent. Second, we introduce a graph neural network, Graph2Tac, with a novel approach to build hierarchical representations for new definitions. Graph2Tac's online definition task realizes a $1.5\times$ improvement in theorems solved over an offline baseline. The $k$-NN and Graph2Tac solvers rely on orthogonal online data, making them highly complementary. Their combination improves $1.27\times$ over their individual performances. Both solvers outperform all other general-purpose provers for Coq, including CoqHammer, Proverbot9001, and a transformer baseline by at least $1.48\times$ and are available for practical use by end-users.</description>

      <title>Efficient Test Data Generation for MC/DC with OCL and Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: System-level testing of avionics software systems requires compliance with different international safety standards such as DO-178C. An important consideration of the avionics industry is automated test data generation according to the criteria suggested by safety standards. One of the recommended criteria by DO-178C is the modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) criterion. The current model-based test data generation approaches use constraints written in Object Constraint Language (OCL), and apply search techniques to generate test data. These approaches either do not support MC/DC criterion or suffer from performance issues while generating test data for large-scale avionics systems. In this paper, we propose an effective way to automate MC/DC test data generation during model-based testing. We develop a strategy that utilizes case-based reasoning (CBR) and range reduction heuristics designed to solve MC/DC-tailored OCL constraints. We performed an empirical study to compare our proposed strategy for MC/DC test data generation using CBR, range reduction, both CBR and range reduction, with an original search algorithm, and random search. We also empirically compared our strategy with existing constraint-solving approaches. The results show that both CBR and range reduction for MC/DC test data generation outperform the baseline approach. Moreover, the combination of both CBR and range reduction for MC/DC test data generation is an effective approach compared to existing constraint solvers.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Reasoning Step Length on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04925v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings. First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences.

      <title>Efficient LLM inference solution on Intel GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer based Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in many fields, and the efficiency of LLM inference becomes hot topic in real applications. However, LLMs are usually complicatedly designed in model structure with massive operations and perform inference in the auto-regressive mode, making it a challenging task to design a system with high efficiency.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient LLM inference solution with low latency and high throughput. Firstly, we simplify the LLM decoder layer by fusing data movement and element-wise operations to reduce the memory access frequency and lower system latency. We also propose a segment KV cache policy to keep key/value of the request and response tokens in separate physical memory for effective device memory management, helping enlarge the runtime batch size and improve system throughput. A customized Scaled-Dot-Product-Attention kernel is designed to match our fusion policy based on the segment KV cache solution. We implement our LLM inference solution on Intel GPU and publish it publicly. Compared with the standard HuggingFace implementation, the proposed solution achieves up to 7x lower token latency and 27x higher throughput for some popular LLMs on Intel GPU.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Silhouette Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silhouette coefficient is an established internal clustering evaluation measure that produces a score per data point, assessing the quality of its clustering assignment. To assess the quality of the clustering of the whole dataset, the scores of all the points in the dataset are typically (micro) averaged into a single value. An alternative path, however, that is rarely employed, is to average first at the cluster level and then (macro) average across clusters. As we illustrate in this work with a synthetic example, the typical micro-averaging strategy is sensitive to cluster imbalance while the overlooked macro-averaging strategy is far more robust. By investigating macro-Silhouette further, we find that uniform sub-sampling, the only available strategy in existing libraries, harms the measure's robustness against imbalance. We address this issue by proposing a per-cluster sampling method. An experimental study on eight real-world datasets is then used to analyse both coefficients in two clustering tasks.</description>

Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), which integrates Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for optimization, has demonstrated remarkable performance advancements. By fusing both approaches, ERL has emerged as a promising research direction. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the diverse research branches in ERL. Specifically, we systematically summarize recent advancements in related algorithms and identify three primary research directions: EA-assisted Optimization of RL, RL-assisted Optimization of EA, and synergistic optimization of EA and RL. Following that, we conduct an in-depth analysis of each research direction, organizing multiple research branches. We elucidate the problems that each branch aims to tackle and how the integration of EAs and RL addresses these challenges. In conclusion, we discuss potential challenges and prospective future research directions across various research directions. To facilitate researchers in delving into ERL, we organize the algorithms and codes involved on https://github.com/yeshenpy/Awesome-Evolutionary-Reinforcement-Learning.</description>

      <title>RomanSetu: Efficiently unlocking multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models via Romanization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to non-English languages that use non-Roman scripts. We propose an approach that utilizes the romanized form of text as an interface for LLMs, hypothesizing that its frequent informal use and shared tokens with English enhance cross-lingual alignment. Our approach involves the continual pretraining of an English LLM like Llama 2 on romanized text of non-English, non-Roman script languages, followed by instruction tuning on romanized data. The results indicate that romanized text not only reduces token fertility by 2x-4x but also matches or outperforms native script representation across various NLU, NLG, and MT tasks. Moreover, the embeddings computed on romanized text exhibit closer alignment with their English translations than those from the native script. Our approach presents a promising direction for leveraging the power of English LLMs in languages traditionally underrepresented in NLP. Our code is available on https://github.com/AI4Bharat/romansetu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topic models have been prevalent for decades to discover latent topics and infer topic proportions of documents in an unsupervised fashion. They have been widely used in various applications like text analysis and context recommendation. Recently, the rise of neural networks has facilitated the emergence of a new research field -- Neural Topic Models (NTMs). Different from conventional topic models, NTMs directly optimize parameters without requiring model-specific derivations. This endows NTMs with better scalability and flexibility, resulting in significant research attention and plentiful new methods and applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on neural topic models concerning methods, applications, and challenges. Specifically, we systematically organize current NTM methods according to their network structures and introduce the NTMs for various scenarios like short texts and bilingual documents. We also discuss a wide range of popular applications built on NTMs. Finally, we highlight the challenges confronted by NTMs to inspire future research. We accompany this survey with a repository for easier access to the mentioned paper resources: https://github.com/bobxwu/Paper-Neural-Topic-Models.</description>

      <title>A practical existence theorem for reduced order models based on convolutional autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has gained increasing popularity in the fields of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Reduced Order Modeling (ROM), providing domain practitioners with new powerful data-driven techniques such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural Operators, Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) and Deep-Learning based ROMs (DL-ROMs). In this context, deep autoencoders based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven extremely effective, outperforming established techniques, such as the reduced basis method, when dealing with complex nonlinear problems. However, despite the empirical success of CNN-based autoencoders, there are only a few theoretical results supporting these architectures, usually stated in the form of universal approximation theorems. In particular, although the existing literature provides users with guidelines for designing convolutional autoencoders, the subsequent challenge of learning the latent features has been barely investigated. Furthermore, many practical questions remain unanswered, e.g., the number of snapshots needed for convergence or the neural network training strategy. In this work, using recent techniques from sparse high-dimensional function approximation, we fill some of these gaps by providing a new practical existence theorem for CNN-based autoencoders when the parameter-to-solution map is holomorphic. This regularity assumption arises in many relevant classes of parametric PDEs, such as the parametric diffusion equation, for which we discuss an explicit application of our general theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03049v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, instruction tuning has gained increasing attention and emerged as a crucial technique to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To construct high-quality instruction datasets, many instruction processing approaches have been proposed, aiming to achieve a delicate balance between data quantity and data quality. Nevertheless, due to inconsistencies that persist among various instruction processing methods, there is no standard open-source instruction processing implementation framework available for the community, which hinders practitioners from further developing and advancing. To facilitate instruction processing research and development, we present EasyInstruct, an easy-to-use instruction processing framework for LLMs, which modularizes instruction generation, selection, and prompting, while also considering their combination and interaction. EasyInstruct is publicly released and actively maintained at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyInstruct, along with an online demo app and a demo video for quick-start, calling for broader research centered on instruction data and synthetic data.</description>

      <title>FaithLM: Towards Faithful Explanations for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become proficient in addressing complex tasks by leveraging their extensive internal knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, the black-box nature of these models complicates the task of explaining their decision-making processes. While recent advancements demonstrate the potential of leveraging LLMs to self-explain their predictions through natural language (NL) explanations, their explanations may not accurately reflect the LLMs' decision-making process due to a lack of fidelity optimization on the derived explanations. Measuring the fidelity of NL explanations is a challenging issue, as it is difficult to manipulate the input context to mask the semantics of these explanations. To this end, we introduce FaithLM to explain the decision of LLMs with NL explanations. Specifically, FaithLM designs a method for evaluating the fidelity of NL explanations by incorporating the contrary explanations to the query process. Moreover, FaithLM conducts an iterative process to improve the fidelity of derived explanations. Experiment results on three datasets from multiple domains demonstrate that FaithLM can significantly improve the fidelity of derived explanations, which also provides a better alignment with the ground-truth explanations.</description>

      <title>Source-Free Domain Adaptation with Diffusion-Guided Source Data Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to leverage the generalizability of Diffusion Models for Source-Free Domain Adaptation (DM-SFDA). Our proposed DMSFDA method involves fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to generate source domain images using features from the target images to guide the diffusion process. Specifically, the pre-trained diffusion model is fine-tuned to generate source samples that minimize entropy and maximize confidence for the pre-trained source model. We then use a diffusion model-based image mixup strategy to bridge the domain gap between the source and target domains. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments across a range of datasets, including Office-31 [39], Office-Home [48], and VisDA [35]. The results demonstrate significant improvements in SFDA performance, highlighting the potential of diffusion models in generating contextually relevant, domain-specific images.</description>

      <title>Feature learning as alignment: a structural property of gradient descent in non-linear neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms through which neural networks extract statistics from input-label pairs through feature learning is one of the most important unsolved problems in supervised learning. Prior works demonstrated that the gram matrices of the weights (the neural feature matrices, NFM) and the average gradient outer products (AGOP) become correlated during training, in a statement known as the neural feature ansatz (NFA). Through the NFA, the authors introduce mapping with the AGOP as a general mechanism for neural feature learning. However, these works do not provide a theoretical explanation for this correlation or its origins. In this work, we further clarify the nature of this correlation, and explain its emergence. We show that this correlation is equivalent to alignment between the left singular structure of the weight matrices and the newly defined pre-activation tangent features at each layer. We further establish that the alignment is driven by the interaction of weight changes induced by SGD with the pre-activation features, and analyze the resulting dynamics analytically at early times in terms of simple statistics of the inputs and labels. Finally, motivated by the observation that the NFA is driven by this centered correlation, we introduce a simple optimization rule that dramatically increases the NFA correlations at any given layer and improves the quality of features learned.</description>

      <title>Who Plays First? Optimizing the Order of Play in Stackelberg Games with Many Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the multi-agent spatial navigation problem of computing the socially optimal order of play, i.e., the sequence in which the agents commit to their decisions, and its associated equilibrium in an N-player Stackelberg trajectory game. We model this problem as a mixed-integer optimization problem over the space of all possible Stackelberg games associated with the order of play's permutations. To solve the problem, we introduce Branch and Play (B&amp;P), an efficient and exact algorithm that provably converges to a socially optimal order of play and its Stackelberg equilibrium. As a subroutine for B&amp;P, we employ and extend sequential trajectory planning, i.e., a popular multi-agent control approach, to scalably compute valid local Stackelberg equilibria for any given order of play. We demonstrate the practical utility of B&amp;P to coordinate air traffic control, swarm formation, and delivery vehicle fleets. We find that B&amp;P consistently outperforms various baselines, and computes the socially optimal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Towards Theoretical Understandings of Self-Consuming Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the emerging challenge of training generative models within a self-consuming loop, wherein successive generations of models are recursively trained on mixtures of real and synthetic data from previous generations. We construct a theoretical framework to rigorously evaluate how this training procedure impacts the data distributions learned by future models, including parametric and non-parametric models. Specifically, we derive bounds on the total variation (TV) distance between the synthetic data distributions produced by future models and the original real data distribution under various mixed training scenarios for diffusion models with a one-hidden-layer neural network score function. Our analysis demonstrates that this distance can be effectively controlled under the condition that mixed training dataset sizes or proportions of real data are large enough. Interestingly, we further unveil a phase transition induced by expanding synthetic data amounts, proving theoretically that while the TV distance exhibits an initial ascent, it declines beyond a threshold point. Finally, we present results for kernel density estimation, delivering nuanced insights such as the impact of mixed data training on error propagation.</description>

      <title>PromptKD: Distilling Student-Friendly Knowledge for Generative Language Models via Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about inference costs, increasing the need for research into model compression. While knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent method for this, research on KD for generative language models like LLMs is relatively sparse, and the approach of distilling student-friendly knowledge, which has shown promising performance in KD for classification models, remains unexplored in generative language models. To explore this approach, we propose PromptKD, a simple yet effective method that utilizes prompt tuning - for the first time in KD - to enable generative language models to transfer student-friendly knowledge. Unlike previous works in classification that require fine-tuning the entire teacher model for extracting student-friendly knowledge, PromptKD achieves similar effects by adding a small number of prompt tokens and tuning only the prompt with student guidance. Extensive experiments on instruction-following datasets show that PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance while adding only 0.0007% of the teacher's parameters as prompts. Further analysis suggests that distilling student-friendly knowledge alleviates exposure bias effectively throughout the entire training process, leading to performance enhancements.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Content Conditional Debiasing for Fair Text Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating biases in machine learning models has become an increasing concern in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in developing fair text embeddings, which are crucial yet challenging for real-world applications like search engines. In response, this paper proposes a novel method for learning fair text embeddings. First, we define a novel content-conditional equal distance (CCED) fairness for text embeddings, ensuring content-conditional independence between sensitive attributes and text embeddings. Building on CCED, we introduce a content-conditional debiasing (CCD) loss to ensure that embeddings of texts with different sensitive attributes but identical content maintain the same distance from the embedding of their corresponding neutral text. Additionally, we tackle the issue of insufficient training data by using Large Language Models (LLMs) with instructions to fairly augment texts into different sensitive groups. Our extensive evaluations show that our approach effectively enhances fairness while maintaining the utility of embeddings. Furthermore, our augmented dataset, combined with the CCED metric, serves as an new benchmark for evaluating fairness.</description>

      <title>Mirror: A Multiple-perspective Self-Reflection Method for Knowledge-rich Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large language models (LLMs) have the capability to iteratively reflect on their own outputs, recent studies have observed their struggles with knowledge-rich problems without access to external resources. In addition to the inefficiency of LLMs in self-assessment, we also observe that LLMs struggle to revisit their predictions despite receiving explicit negative feedback. Therefore, We propose Mirror, a Multiple-perspective self-reflection method for knowledge-rich reasoning, to avoid getting stuck at a particular reflection iteration. Mirror enables LLMs to reflect from multiple-perspective clues, achieved through a heuristic interaction between a Navigator and a Reasoner. It guides agents toward diverse yet plausibly reliable reasoning trajectory without access to ground truth by encouraging (1) diversity of directions generated by Navigator and (2) agreement among strategically induced perturbations in responses generated by the Reasoner. The experiments on five reasoning datasets demonstrate that Mirror's superiority over several contemporary self-reflection approaches. Additionally, the ablation study studies clearly indicate that our strategies alleviate the aforementioned challenges.</description>

      <title>Why Transformers Need Adam: A Hessian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SGD performs worse than Adam by a significant margin on Transformers, but the reason remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of Hessian: (i) Transformers are "heterogeneous": the Hessian spectrum across parameter blocks vary dramatically, a phenomenon we call "block heterogeneity"; (ii) Heterogeneity hampers SGD: SGD performs worse than Adam on problems with block heterogeneity. To validate (i) and (ii), we check various Transformers, CNNs, MLPs, and quadratic problems, and find that SGD can perform on par with Adam on problems without block heterogeneity, but performs worse than Adam when the heterogeneity exists. Our initial theoretical analysis indicates that SGD performs worse because it applies one single learning rate to all blocks, which cannot handle the heterogeneity among blocks. This limitation could be ameliorated if we use coordinate-wise learning rates, as designed in Adam.</description>

      <title>Pandora's White-Box: Precise Training Data Detection and Extraction in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop state-of-the-art privacy attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), where an adversary with some access to the model tries to learn something about the underlying training data. Our headline results are new membership inference attacks (MIAs) against pretrained LLMs that perform hundreds of times better than baseline attacks, and a pipeline showing that over 50% (!) of the fine-tuning dataset can be extracted from a fine-tuned LLM in natural settings. We consider varying degrees of access to the underlying model, pretraining and fine-tuning data, and both MIAs and training data extraction. For pretraining data, we propose two new MIAs: a supervised neural network classifier that predicts training data membership on the basis of (dimensionality-reduced) model gradients, as well as a variant of this attack that only requires logit access to the model by leveraging recent model-stealing work on LLMs. To our knowledge this is the first MIA that explicitly incorporates model-stealing information. Both attacks outperform existing black-box baselines, and our supervised attack closes the gap between MIA attack success against LLMs and the strongest known attacks for other machine learning models. In fine-tuning, we find that a simple attack based on the ratio of the loss between the base and fine-tuned models is able to achieve near-perfect MIA performance; we then leverage our MIA to extract a large fraction of the fine-tuning dataset from fine-tuned Pythia and Llama models. Our code is available at github.com/safr-ai-lab/pandora-llm.</description>

      <title>Watermark Stealing in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM watermarking has attracted attention as a promising way to detect AI-generated content, with some works suggesting that current schemes may already be fit for deployment. In this work we dispute this claim, identifying watermark stealing (WS) as a fundamental vulnerability of these schemes. We show that querying the API of the watermarked LLM to approximately reverse-engineer a watermark enables practical spoofing attacks, as hypothesized in prior work, but also greatly boosts scrubbing attacks, which was previously unnoticed. We are the first to propose an automated WS algorithm and use it in the first comprehensive study of spoofing and scrubbing in realistic settings. We show that for under $50 an attacker can both spoof and scrub state-of-the-art schemes previously considered safe, with average success rate of over 80%. Our findings challenge common beliefs about LLM watermarking, stressing the need for more robust schemes. We make all our code and additional examples available at https://watermark-stealing.org.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of LLMs on Syntax-Aware Code Fill-in-the-Middle Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Syntax-Aware Fill-In-the-Middle (SAFIM), a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on the code Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) task. This benchmark focuses on syntax-aware completions of program structures such as code blocks and conditional expressions, and includes 17,720 examples from multiple programming languages, sourced from recent code submissions after April 2022 to minimize data contamination. SAFIM provides a robust framework with various prompt designs and novel syntax-aware post-processing techniques, facilitating accurate and fair comparisons across LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs shows that FIM pretraining not only enhances FIM proficiency but also improves Left-to-Right (L2R) inference using LLMs. Our findings challenge conventional beliefs and suggest that pretraining methods and data quality have more impact than model size. SAFIM thus serves as a foundational platform for future research in effective pretraining strategies for code LLMs. The evaluation toolkit and dataset are available at https://github.com/gonglinyuan/safim, and the leaderboard is available at https://safimbenchmark.com.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Tokenization: Evaluating Text Compression and its Correlation with Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite it being the cornerstone of BPE, the most common tokenization algorithm, the importance of compression in the tokenization process is still unclear. In this paper, we argue for the theoretical importance of compression, that can be viewed as 0-gram language modeling where equal probability is assigned to all tokens. We also demonstrate the empirical importance of compression for downstream success of pre-trained language models. We control the compression ability of several BPE tokenizers by varying the amount of documents available during their training: from 1 million documents to a character-based tokenizer equivalent to no training data at all. We then pre-train English language models based on those tokenizers and fine-tune them over several tasks. We show that there is a correlation between tokenizers' compression and models' downstream performance, suggesting that compression is a reliable intrinsic indicator of tokenization quality. These correlations are more pronounced for generation tasks (over classification) or for smaller models (over large ones). We replicated a representative part of our experiments on Turkish and found similar results, confirming that our results hold for languages with typological characteristics dissimilar to English. We conclude that building better compressing tokenizers is a fruitful avenue for further research and for improving overall model performance.</description>

      <title>Complex Reasoning over Logical Queries on Commonsense Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event commonsense reasoning requires the ability to reason about the relationship between events, as well as infer implicit context underlying that relationship. However, data scarcity makes it challenging for language models to learn to generate commonsense inferences for contexts and questions involving interactions between complex events. To address this demand, we present COM2 (COMplex COMmonsense), a new dataset created by sampling multi-hop logical queries (e.g., the joint effect or cause of both event A and B, or the effect of the effect of event C) from an existing commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG), and verbalizing them using handcrafted rules and large language models into multiple-choice and text generation questions. Our experiments show that language models trained on COM2 exhibit significant improvements in complex reasoning ability, resulting in enhanced zero-shot performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks for question answering and generative commonsense reasoning, without expensive human annotations. Code and data are available at https://github.com/tqfang/complex-commonsense-reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey provides an in-depth analysis of knowledge conflicts for large language models (LLMs), highlighting the complex challenges they encounter when blending contextual and parametric knowledge. Our focus is on three categories of knowledge conflicts: context-memory, inter-context, and intra-memory conflict. These conflicts can significantly impact the trustworthiness and performance of LLMs, especially in real-world applications where noise and misinformation are common. By categorizing these conflicts, exploring the causes, examining the behaviors of LLMs under such conflicts, and reviewing available solutions, this survey aims to shed light on strategies for improving the robustness of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Code Intelligence -- leveraging deep learning to understand, generate, and optimize code -- holds immense potential for transformative impacts on the whole society. Bridging the gap between Natural Language and Programming Language, this domain has drawn significant attention from researchers in both research communities over the past few years. This survey presents a systematic and chronological review of the advancements in code intelligence, encompassing over 50 representative models and their variants, more than 20 categories of tasks, and an extensive coverage of over 680 related works. We follow the historical progression to trace the paradigm shifts across different research phases (e.g., from modeling code with recurrent neural networks to the era of Large Language Models). Concurrently, we highlight the major technical transitions in models, tasks, and evaluations spanning through different stages. For applications, we also observe a co-evolving shift. It spans from initial endeavors to tackling specific scenarios, through exploring a diverse array of tasks during its rapid expansion, to currently focusing on tackling increasingly complex and varied real-world challenges. Building on our examination of the developmental trajectories, we further investigate the emerging synergies between code intelligence and broader machine intelligence, uncovering new cross-domain opportunities and illustrating the substantial influence of code intelligence across various domains. Finally, we delve into both the opportunities and challenges associated with this field, alongside elucidating our insights on the most promising research directions. An ongoing, dynamically updated project and resources associated with this survey have been released at https://github.com/QiushiSun/NCISurvey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in advancing natural language processing but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to inefficient attention distributions. In this paper, we explore the effect of increased computed tokens on LLM performance and introduce a novel method for extending computed tokens in the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process, utilizing attention mechanism optimization. By fine-tuning an LLM on a domain-specific, highly structured dataset, we analyze attention patterns across layers, identifying inefficiencies caused by non-semantic tokens with outlier high attention scores. To address this, we propose an algorithm that emulates early layer attention patterns across downstream layers to re-balance skewed attention distributions and enhance knowledge abstraction. Our findings demonstrate that our approach not only facilitates a deeper understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs but also significantly improves their reasoning capabilities, particularly in non-STEM domains. Our study lays the groundwork for further innovations in LLM design, aiming to create more powerful, versatile, and responsible models capable of tackling a broad range of real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Language Models in Dialogue: Conversational Maxims for Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern language models, while sophisticated, exhibit some inherent shortcomings, particularly in conversational settings. We claim that many of the observed shortcomings can be attributed to violation of one or more conversational principles. By drawing upon extensive research from both the social science and AI communities, we propose a set of maxims -- quantity, quality, relevance, manner, benevolence, and transparency -- for describing effective human-AI conversation. We first justify the applicability of the first four maxims (from Grice) in the context of human-AI interactions. We then argue that two new maxims, benevolence (concerning the generation of, and engagement with, harmful content) and transparency (concerning recognition of one's knowledge boundaries, operational constraints, and intents), are necessary for addressing behavior unique to modern human-AI interactions. We evaluate the degree to which various language models are able to understand these maxims and find that models possess an internal prioritization of principles that can significantly impact their ability to interpret the maxims accurately.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Reassessment of Large-Scale Evaluation Outcomes in LLMs: A Multifaceted Statistical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amidst the rapid evolution of LLMs, the significance of evaluation in comprehending and propelling these models forward is increasingly paramount. Evaluations have revealed that factors such as scaling, training types, architectures and other factors profoundly impact the performance of LLMs. However, the extent and nature of these impacts continue to be subjects of debate because most assessments have been restricted to a limited number of models and data points. Clarifying the effects of these factors on performance scores can be more effectively achieved through a statistical lens. Our study embarks on a thorough re-examination of these LLMs, targeting the inadequacies in current evaluation methods. With the advent of a uniform evaluation framework, our research leverages an expansive dataset of evaluation results, introducing a comprehensive statistical methodology. This includes the application of ANOVA, Tukey HSD tests, GAMM, and clustering technique, offering a robust and transparent approach to deciphering LLM performance data. Contrary to prevailing findings, our results challenge assumptions about emergent abilities and the influence of given training types and architectures in LLMs. These findings furnish new perspectives on the characteristics, intrinsic nature, and developmental trajectories of LLMs. By providing straightforward and reliable methods to scrutinize and reassess LLM performance data, this study contributes a nuanced perspective on LLM efficiency and potentials.</description>

      <title>Qibo: A Large Language Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant progress in a number of professional fields, including medicine, law, and finance. However, in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), there are challenges such as the essential differences between theory and modern medicine, the lack of specialized corpus resources, and the fact that relying only on supervised fine-tuning may lead to overconfident predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training approach that combines continuous pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. A notable contribution of our study is the processing of a 2GB corpus dedicated to TCM, constructing pre-training and instruction fine-tuning datasets for TCM, respectively. In addition, we have developed Qibo-Benchmark, a tool that evaluates the performance of LLM in the TCM on multiple dimensions, including subjective, objective, and three TCM NLP tasks. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, named $\textbf{Qibo}$, exhibits significant performance boosts. Compared to the baselines, the average subjective win rate is 63%, the average objective accuracy improved by 23% to 58%, and the Rouge-L scores for the three TCM NLP tasks are 0.72, 0.61, and 0.55. Finally, we propose a pipline to apply Qibo to TCM consultation and demonstrate the model performance through the case study.</description>

      <title>Learning Action-based Representations Using Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning agents using high-dimensional observations must be able to identify relevant state features amidst many exogeneous distractors. A representation that captures controllability identifies these state elements by determining what affects agent control. While methods such as inverse dynamics and mutual information capture controllability for a limited number of timesteps, capturing long-horizon elements remains a challenging problem. Myopic controllability can capture the moment right before an agent crashes into a wall, but not the control-relevance of the wall while the agent is still some distance away. To address this we introduce action-bisimulation encoding, a method inspired by the bisimulation invariance pseudometric, that extends single-step controllability with a recursive invariance constraint. By doing this, action-bisimulation learns a multi-step controllability metric that smoothly discounts distant state features that are relevant for control. We demonstrate that action-bisimulation pretraining on reward-free, uniformly random data improves sample efficiency in several environments, including a photorealistic 3D simulation domain, Habitat. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis and qualitative results demonstrating the information captured by action-bisimulation.</description>

      <title>LLMs Are Few-Shot In-Context Low-Resource Language Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16512v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) empowers large language models (LLMs) to perform diverse tasks in underrepresented languages using only short in-context information, offering a crucial avenue for narrowing the gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. Nonetheless, there is only a handful of works explored ICL for low-resource languages with most of them focusing on relatively high-resource languages, such as French and Spanish. In this work, we extensively study ICL and its cross-lingual variation (X-ICL) on 25 low-resource and 7 relatively higher-resource languages. Our study not only assesses the effectiveness of ICL with LLMs in low-resource languages but also identifies the shortcomings of in-context label alignment, and introduces a more effective alternative: query alignment. Moreover, we provide valuable insights into various facets of ICL for low-resource languages. Our study concludes the significance of few-shot in-context information on enhancing the low-resource understanding quality of LLMs through semantically relevant information by closing the language gap in the target language and aligning the semantics between the targeted low-resource and the high-resource language that the model is proficient in. Our work highlights the importance of advancing ICL research, particularly for low-resource languages.

      <title>Human-compatible driving partners through data-regularized self-play reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge for autonomous vehicles is coordinating with humans. Therefore, incorporating realistic human agents is essential for scalable training and evaluation of autonomous driving systems in simulation. Simulation agents are typically developed by imitating large-scale, high-quality datasets of human driving. However, pure imitation learning agents empirically have high collision rates when executed in a multi-agent closed-loop setting. To build agents that are realistic and effective in closed-loop settings, we propose Human-Regularized PPO (HR-PPO), a multi-agent algorithm where agents are trained through self-play with a small penalty for deviating from a human reference policy. In contrast to prior work, our approach is RL-first and only uses 30 minutes of imperfect human demonstrations. We evaluate agents in a large set of multi-agent traffic scenes. Results show our HR-PPO agents are highly effective in achieving goals, with a success rate of 93%, an off-road rate of 3.5%, and a collision rate of 3%. At the same time, the agents drive in a human-like manner, as measured by their similarity to existing human driving logs. We also find that HR-PPO agents show considerable improvements on proxy measures for coordination with human driving, particularly in highly interactive scenarios. We open-source our code and trained agents at https://github.com/Emerge-Lab/nocturne_lab and provide demonstrations of agent behaviors at https://sites.google.com/view/driving-partners.</description>

      <title>Regularized Best-of-N Sampling to Mitigate Reward Hacking for Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Best-of-N (BoN) sampling with a reward model has been shown to be an effective strategy for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences at the time of decoding. BoN sampling is susceptible to a problem known as reward hacking. Because the reward model is an imperfect proxy for the true objective, over-optimizing its value can compromise its performance on the true objective. A common solution to prevent reward hacking in preference learning techniques is to optimize a reward using proximity regularization (e.g., KL regularization), which ensures that the language model remains close to the reference model. In this research, we propose Regularized Best-of-N (RBoN), a variant of BoN that aims to mitigate reward hacking by incorporating a proximity term in response selection, similar to preference learning techniques. We evaluate RBoN on the AlpacaFarm and Anthropic's hh-rlhf datasets and find that it outperforms BoN. As an application of RBoN, we use RBoN to generate a pairwise preference learning dataset. Experimental results show that a DPO model trained on a dataset generated with RBoN outperforms a DPO model generated with vanilla BoN.

      <title>LLMs in the Loop: Leveraging Large Language Model Annotations for Active Learning in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-resource languages face significant barriers in AI development due to limited linguistic resources and expertise for data labeling, rendering them rare and costly. The scarcity of data and the absence of preexisting tools exacerbate these challenges, especially since these languages may not be adequately represented in various NLP datasets. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the potential of LLMs in the active learning loop for data annotation. Initially, we conduct evaluations to assess inter-annotator agreement and consistency, facilitating the selection of a suitable LLM annotator. The chosen annotator is then integrated into a training loop for a classifier using an active learning paradigm, minimizing the amount of queried data required. Empirical evaluations, notably employing GPT-4-Turbo, demonstrate near-state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced data requirements, as indicated by estimated potential cost savings of at least 42.45 times compared to human annotation. Our proposed solution shows promising potential to substantially reduce both the monetary and computational costs associated with automation in low-resource settings. By bridging the gap between low-resource languages and AI, this approach fosters broader inclusion and shows the potential to enable automation across diverse linguistic landscapes.</description>

      <title>RL for Consistency Models: Faster Reward Guided Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved guided image generation with diffusion models by directly optimizing rewards that capture image quality, aesthetics, and instruction following capabilities. However, the resulting generative policies inherit the same iterative sampling process of diffusion models that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, consistency models proposed learning a new class of generative models that directly map noise to data, resulting in a model that can generate an image in as few as one sampling iteration. In this work, to optimize text-to-image generative models for task specific rewards and enable fast training and inference, we propose a framework for fine-tuning consistency models via RL. Our framework, called Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Model (RLCM), frames the iterative inference process of a consistency model as an RL procedure. Comparing to RL finetuned diffusion models, RLCM trains significantly faster, improves the quality of the generation measured under the reward objectives, and speeds up the inference procedure by generating high quality images with as few as two inference steps. Experimentally, we show that RLCM can adapt text-to-image consistency models to objectives that are challenging to express with prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality.

      <title>CLUE: A Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs aim to address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. Assessing the models' suitability for this sensitive application area is of the utmost importance. However, evaluation has primarily been limited to non-clinical tasks, which do not reflect the complexity of practical clinical applications. To fill this gap, we present the Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE), a benchmark tailored to evaluate LLMs on clinical tasks. CLUE includes six tasks to test the practical applicability of LLMs in complex healthcare settings. Our evaluation includes a total of $25$ LLMs. In contrast to previous evaluations, CLUE shows a decrease in performance for nine out of twelve biomedical models. Our benchmark represents a step towards a standardized approach to evaluating and developing LLMs in healthcare to align future model development with the real-world needs of clinical application. We open-source all evaluation scripts and datasets for future research at https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CLUE.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Speech Anonymization on Pathology and Its Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integration of speech into healthcare has intensified privacy concerns due to its potential as a non-invasive biomarker containing individual biometric information. In response, speaker anonymization aims to conceal personally identifiable information while retaining crucial linguistic content. However, the application of anonymization techniques to pathological speech, a critical area where privacy is especially vital, has not been extensively examined. This study investigates anonymization's impact on pathological speech across over 2,700 speakers from multiple German institutions, focusing on privacy, pathological utility, and demographic fairness. We explore both deep-learning-based and signal processing-based anonymization methods, and document substantial privacy improvements across disorders-evidenced by equal error rate increases up to 1933%, with minimal overall impact on utility. Specific disorders such as Dysarthria, Dysphonia, and Cleft Lip and Palate experienced minimal utility changes, while Dysglossia showed slight improvements. Our findings underscore that the impact of anonymization varies substantially across different disorders. This necessitates disorder-specific anonymization strategies to optimally balance privacy with diagnostic utility. Additionally, our fairness analysis revealed consistent anonymization effects across most of the demographics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of anonymization in pathological speech for enhancing privacy, while also highlighting the importance of customized and disorder-specific approaches to account for inversion attacks.</description>

      <title>Using Game Engines and Machine Learning to Create Synthetic Satellite Imagery for a Tabletop Verification Exercise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite imagery is regarded as a great opportunity for citizen-based monitoring of activities of interest. Relevant imagery may however not be available at sufficiently high resolution, quality, or cadence -- let alone be uniformly accessible to open-source analysts. This limits an assessment of the true long-term potential of citizen-based monitoring of nuclear activities using publicly available satellite imagery. In this article, we demonstrate how modern game engines combined with advanced machine-learning techniques can be used to generate synthetic imagery of sites of interest with the ability to choose relevant parameters upon request; these include time of day, cloud cover, season, or level of activity onsite. At the same time, resolution and off-nadir angle can be adjusted to simulate different characteristics of the satellite. While there are several possible use-cases for synthetic imagery, here we focus on its usefulness to support tabletop exercises in which simple monitoring scenarios can be examined to better understand verification capabilities enabled by new satellite constellations and very short revisit times.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Potential of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for Fairness Along the AI Lifecycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems across various domains is increasingly highlighting issues related to algorithmic fairness, especially in high-stakes scenarios. Thus, critical considerations of how fairness in AI systems might be improved, and what measures are available to aid this process, are overdue. Many researchers and policymakers see explainable AI (XAI) as a promising way to increase fairness in AI systems. However, there is a wide variety of XAI methods and fairness conceptions expressing different desiderata, and the precise connections between XAI and fairness remain largely nebulous. Besides, different measures to increase algorithmic fairness might be applicable at different points throughout an AI system's lifecycle. Yet, there currently is no coherent mapping of fairness desiderata along the AI lifecycle. In this paper, we set out to bridge both these gaps: We distill eight fairness desiderata, map them along the AI lifecycle, and discuss how XAI could help address each of them. We hope to provide orientation for practical applications and to inspire XAI research specifically focused on these fairness desiderata.</description>

      <title>Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion: Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment and Spatially-variant Deformation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) has been extensively studied and great progress has been made, there are still key challenges that hinder their broad real-world applications: 1) the inherent motion/rotation ambiguity requires either explicit camera motion recovery with extra constraint or complex Procrustean Alignment; 2) existing low-rank modeling of the global shape can over-penalize drastic deformations in the 3D shape sequence. This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second, we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods, and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

Abstract: Graphs are an essential data structure utilized to represent relationships in real-world scenarios. Prior research has established that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) deliver impressive outcomes in graph-centric tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite these advancements, challenges like data sparsity and limited generalization capabilities continue to persist. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention in natural language processing. They excel in language comprehension and summarization. Integrating LLMs with graph learning techniques has attracted interest as a way to enhance performance in graph learning tasks. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth review of the latest state-of-the-art LLMs applied in graph learning and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize existing methods based on their framework design. We detail four unique designs: i) GNNs as Prefix, ii) LLMs as Prefix, iii) LLMs-Graphs Integration, and iv) LLMs-Only, highlighting key methodologies within each category. We explore the strengths and limitations of each framework, and emphasize potential avenues for future research, including overcoming current integration challenges between LLMs and graph learning techniques, and venturing into new application areas. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners eager to leverage large language models in graph learning, and to inspire continued progress in this dynamic field.

      <title>An Embarrassingly Simple Approach to Enhance Transformer Performance in Genomic Selection for Crop Breeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genomic selection (GS), as a critical crop breeding strategy, plays a key role in enhancing food production and addressing the global hunger crisis. The predominant approaches in GS currently revolve around employing statistical methods for prediction. However, statistical methods often come with two main limitations: strong statistical priors and linear assumptions. A recent trend is to capture the non-linear relationships between markers by deep learning. However, as crop datasets are commonly long sequences with limited samples, the robustness of deep learning models, especially Transformers, remains a challenge. In this work, to unleash the unexplored potential of attention mechanism for the task of interest, we propose a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework that enables end-to-end training of the whole sequence. Via experiments on rice3k and wheat3k datasets, we show that, with simple tricks such as k-mer tokenization and random masking, Transformer can achieve overall superior performance against seminal methods on GS tasks of interest.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Robotic Language Grounding: Tradeoffs between Symbols and Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With large language models, robots can understand language more flexibly and more capable than ever before. This survey reviews and situates recent literature into a spectrum with two poles: 1) mapping between language and some manually defined formal representation of meaning, and 2) mapping between language and high-dimensional vector spaces that translate directly to low-level robot policy. Using a formal representation allows the meaning of the language to be precisely represented, limits the size of the learning problem, and leads to a framework for interpretability and formal safety guarantees. Methods that embed language and perceptual data into high-dimensional spaces avoid this manually specified symbolic structure and thus have the potential to be more general when fed enough data but require more data and computing to train. We discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of each approach and finish by providing directions for future work that achieves the best of both worlds.</description>

      <title>MCDFN: Supply Chain Demand Forecasting via an Explainable Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing supply chain management. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our rigorous benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738%), RMSE (4.8553%), MAE (3.9991%), and MAPE (20.1575%). Additionally, MCDFN's predictions were statistically indistinguishable from actual values, confirmed by a paired t-test with a 5% p-value and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.</description>

      <title>Long and Short Guidance in Score identity Distillation for One-Step Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trained on extensive text-image pairs have shown the capacity to generate photorealistic images consistent with textual descriptions. However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. In this paper, we enhance Score identity Distillation (SiD) by developing long and short classifier-free guidance (LSG) to efficiently distill pretrained Stable Diffusion models without using real training data. SiD aims to optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss, utilizing a score-identity-based approximation alongside the proposed LSG for practical computation. By training exclusively with fake images synthesized with its one-step generator, SiD equipped with LSG rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Specifically, its data-free distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves a record low FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation set, with a CLIP score of 0.304 at an LSG scale of 1.5, and a FID of 9.56 with a CLIP score of 0.313 at an LSG scale of 2. Our SiD-LSG code and distilled one-step text-to-image generators are available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG</description>

      <title>FightLadder: A Benchmark for Competitive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) heavily rely on a variety of well-designed benchmarks, which provide environmental platforms and consistent criteria to evaluate existing and novel algorithms. Specifically, in multi-agent RL (MARL), a plethora of benchmarks based on cooperative games have spurred the development of algorithms that improve the scalability of cooperative multi-agent systems. However, for the competitive setting, a lightweight and open-sourced benchmark with challenging gaming dynamics and visual inputs has not yet been established. In this work, we present FightLadder, a real-time fighting game platform, to empower competitive MARL research. Along with the platform, we provide implementations of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms for competitive games, as well as a set of evaluation metrics to characterize the performance and exploitability of agents. We demonstrate the feasibility of this platform by training a general agent that consistently defeats 12 built-in characters in single-player mode, and expose the difficulty of training a non-exploitable agent without human knowledge and demonstrations in two-player mode. FightLadder provides meticulously designed environments to address critical challenges in competitive MARL research, aiming to catalyze a new era of discovery and advancement in the field.

      <title>Evaluating the World Model Implicit in a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models may implicitly learn world models. How should we assess this possibility? We formalize this question for the case where the underlying reality is governed by a deterministic finite automaton. This includes problems as diverse as simple logical reasoning, geographic navigation, game-playing, and chemistry. We propose new evaluation metrics for world model recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem from language theory. We illustrate their utility in three domains: game playing, logic puzzles, and navigation. In all domains, the generative models we consider do well on existing diagnostics for assessing world models, but our evaluation metrics reveal their world models to be far less coherent than they appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using a generative model to solve related but subtly different tasks can lead it to fail badly. Building generative models that meaningfully capture the underlying logic of the domains they model would be immensely valuable; our results suggest new ways to assess how close a given model is to that goal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of various online and mobile payment systems, credit card fraud has emerged as a significant threat to financial security. This study focuses on innovative applications of the latest Transformer models for more robust and precise fraud detection. To ensure the reliability of the data, we meticulously processed the data sources, balancing the dataset to address the issue of data sparsity significantly. We also selected highly correlated vectors to strengthen the training process.To guarantee the reliability and practicality of the new Transformer model, we conducted performance comparisons with several widely adopted models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. We rigorously compared these models using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Through these detailed analyses and comparisons, we present to the readers a highly efficient and powerful anti-fraud mechanism with promising prospects. The results demonstrate that the Transformer model not only excels in traditional applications but also shows great potential in niche areas like fraud detection, offering a substantial advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>FairytaleQA Translated: Enabling Educational Question and Answer Generation in Less-Resourced Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Question Answering (QA) datasets are crucial in assessing reading comprehension skills for both machines and humans. While numerous datasets have been developed in English for this purpose, a noticeable void exists in less-resourced languages. To alleviate this gap, our paper introduces machine-translated versions of FairytaleQA, a renowned QA dataset designed to assess and enhance narrative comprehension skills in young children. By employing fine-tuned, modest-scale models, we establish benchmarks for both Question Generation (QG) and QA tasks within the translated datasets. In addition, we present a case study proposing a model for generating question-answer pairs, with an evaluation incorporating quality metrics such as question well-formedness, answerability, relevance, and children suitability. Our evaluation prioritizes quantifying and describing error cases, along with providing directions for future work. This paper contributes to the advancement of QA and QG research in less-resourced languages, promoting accessibility and inclusivity in the development of these models for reading comprehension.

      <title>I2EDL: Interactive Instruction Error Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) task, the human user guides an autonomous agent to reach a target goal via a series of low-level actions following a textual instruction in natural language. However, most existing methods do not address the likely case where users may make mistakes when providing such instruction (e.g. "turn left" instead of "turn right"). In this work, we address a novel task of Interactive VLN in Continuous Environments (IVLN-CE), which allows the agent to interact with the user during the VLN-CE navigation to verify any doubts regarding the instruction errors. We propose an Interactive Instruction Error Detector and Localizer (I2EDL) that triggers the user-agent interaction upon the detection of instruction errors during the navigation. We leverage a pre-trained module to detect instruction errors and pinpoint them in the instruction by cross-referencing the textual input and past observations. In such way, the agent is able to query the user for a timely correction, without demanding the user's cognitive load, as we locate the probable errors to a precise part of the instruction. We evaluate the proposed I2EDL on a dataset of instructions containing errors, and further devise a novel metric, the Success weighted by Interaction Number (SIN), to reflect both the navigation performance and the interaction effectiveness. We show how the proposed method can ask focused requests for corrections to the user, which in turn increases the navigation success, while minimizing the interactions.</description>

      <title>CaLM: Contrasting Large and Small Language Models to Verify Grounded Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounded generation aims to equip language models (LMs) with the ability to produce more credible and accountable responses by accurately citing verifiable sources. However, existing methods, by either feeding LMs with raw or preprocessed materials, remain prone to errors. To address this, we introduce CaLM, a novel verification framework. CaLM leverages the insight that a robust grounded response should be consistent with information derived solely from its cited sources. Our framework empowers smaller LMs, which rely less on parametric memory and excel at processing relevant information given a query, to validate the output of larger LMs. Larger LM responses that closely align with the smaller LMs' output, which relies exclusively on cited documents, are verified. Responses showing discrepancies are iteratively refined through a feedback loop. Experiments on three open-domain question-answering datasets demonstrate significant performance gains of 1.5% to 7% absolute average without any required model fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recommendation systems, high-quality user embeddings can capture subtle preferences, enable precise similarity calculations, and adapt to changing preferences over time to maintain relevance. The effectiveness of recommendation systems depends on the quality of user embedding. We propose to asynchronously learn high fidelity user embeddings for billions of users each day from sequence based multimodal user activities through a Transformer-like large scale feature learning module. The async learned user representations embeddings (ALURE) are further converted to user similarity graphs through graph learning and then combined with user realtime activities to retrieval highly related ads candidates for the ads delivery system. Our method shows significant gains in both offline and online experiments.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Graph Generation for Enhanced Domain Adaptive Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of Domain Adaptive in the field of Object Detection involves the transfer of object detection models from labeled source domains to unannotated target domains. Recent advancements in this field aim to address domain discrepancies by aligning pixel-pairs across domains within a non-Euclidean graphical space, thereby minimizing semantic distribution variance. Despite their remarkable achievements, these methods often use coarse semantic representations to model graphs, mainly due to ignoring non-informative elements and failing to focus on precise semantic alignment. Additionally, the generation of coarse graphs inherently introduces abnormal nodes, posing challenges and potentially biasing domain adaptation outcomes. Consequently, we propose a framework, which utilizes the Graph Generation to enhance the quality of DAOD (\method{}). Specifically, we introduce a Node Refinement module that utilizes a memory bank to reconstruct noisy sampled nodes while applying contrastive regularization to noisy features. To enhance semantic alignment, we propose separating domain-specific styles from category invariance encoded within graph covariances, which allows us to selectively remove domain-specific styles while preserving category-invariant information, thus facilitating more accurate semantic alignment across different domains. Furthermore, we propose a Graph Optimization adaptor, leveraging variational inference to mitigate the impact of abnormal nodes. Extensive experimentation across three adaptation benchmarks validates that \method{} achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task of unsupervised domain adaptation.</description>

      <title>VulDetectBench: Evaluating the Deep Capability of Vulnerability Detection with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have training corpora containing large amounts of program code, greatly improving the model's code comprehension and generation capabilities. However, sound comprehensive research on detecting program vulnerabilities, a more specific task related to code, and evaluating the performance of LLMs in this more specialized scenario is still lacking. To address common challenges in vulnerability analysis, our study introduces a new benchmark, VulDetectBench, specifically designed to assess the vulnerability detection capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates LLM's ability to identify, classify, and locate vulnerabilities through five tasks of increasing difficulty. We evaluate the performance of 17 models (both open- and closed-source) and find that while existing models can achieve over 80% accuracy on tasks related to vulnerability identification and classification, they still fall short on specific, more detailed vulnerability analysis tasks, with less than 30% accuracy, making it difficult to provide valuable auxiliary information for professional vulnerability mining. Our benchmark effectively evaluates the capabilities of various LLMs at different levels in the specific task of vulnerability detection, providing a foundation for future research and improvements in this critical area of code security. VulDetectBench is publicly available at https://github.com/Sweetaroo/VulDetectBench.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is crucial in today's cybersecurity landscape, providing essential insights to understand and mitigate the ever-evolving cyber threats. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in this domain, but concerns about their reliability, accuracy, and hallucinations persist. While existing benchmarks provide general evaluations of LLMs, there are no benchmarks that address the practical and applied aspects of CTI-specific tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce CTIBench, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs' performance in CTI applications. CTIBench includes multiple datasets focused on evaluating knowledge acquired by LLMs in the cyber-threat landscape. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art models on these tasks provides insights into their strengths and weaknesses in CTI contexts, contributing to a better understanding of LLM capabilities in CTI.</description>

      <title>Progress Towards Decoding Visual Imagery via fNIRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the possibility of reconstructing images from fNIRS brain activity and start building a prototype to match the required specs. By training an image reconstruction model on downsampled fMRI data, we discovered that cm-scale spatial resolution is sufficient for image generation. We obtained 71% retrieval accuracy with 1-cm resolution, compared to 93% on the full-resolution fMRI, and 20% with 2-cm resolution. With simulations and high-density tomography, we found that time-domain fNIRS can achieve 1-cm resolution, compared to 2-cm resolution for continuous-wave fNIRS. Lastly, we share designs for a prototype time-domain fNIRS device, consisting of a laser driver, a single photon detector, and a time-to-digital converter system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) have simultaneously opened new avenues for enhancing human learning and increased the prevalence of poor-quality information in student response - termed Botpoop. This study introduces Professor Leodar, a custom-built, Singlish-speaking Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to enhance educational while reducing Botpoop. Deployed at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Professor Leodar offers a glimpse into the future of AI-assisted learning, offering personalized guidance, 24/7 availability, and contextually relevant information. Through a mixed-methods approach, we examine the impact of Professor Leodar on learning, engagement, and exam preparedness, with 97.1% of participants reporting positive experiences. These findings help define possible roles of AI in education and highlight the potential of custom GenAI chatbots. Our combination of chatbot development, in-class deployment and outcomes study offers a benchmark for GenAI educational tools and is a stepping stone for redefining the interplay between AI and human learning.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Domain Adaptation to Understand Physico-Chemical Processes from Fluorescence Spectroscopy Small Datasets: Application to Ageing of Olive Oil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in life sciences and chemistry, widely used for applications such as environmental monitoring, food quality control, and biomedical diagnostics. However, analysis of spectroscopic data with deep learning, in particular of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), presents significant challenges due to the typically small and sparse datasets available. Furthermore, the analysis of EEMs is difficult due to their high dimensionality and overlapping spectral features. This study proposes a new approach that exploits domain adaptation with pretrained vision models, alongside a novel interpretability algorithm to address these challenges. Thanks to specialised feature engineering of the neural networks described in this work, we are now able to provide deeper insights into the physico-chemical processes underlying the data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through the analysis of the oxidation process in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) during ageing, showing its effectiveness in predicting quality indicators and identifying the spectral bands, and thus the molecules involved in the process. This work describes a significantly innovative approach in the use of deep learning for spectroscopy, transforming it from a black box into a tool for understanding complex biological and chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Localizing Events in Videos with Multimodal Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video understanding is a pivotal task in the digital era, yet the dynamic and multievent nature of videos makes them labor-intensive and computationally demanding to process. Thus, localizing a specific event given a semantic query has gained importance in both user-oriented applications like video search and academic research into video foundation models. A significant limitation in current research is that semantic queries are typically in natural language that depicts the semantics of the target event. This setting overlooks the potential for multimodal semantic queries composed of images and texts. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, ICQ, for localizing events in videos with multimodal queries, along with a new evaluation dataset ICQ-Highlight. Our new benchmark aims to evaluate how well models can localize an event given a multimodal semantic query that consists of a reference image, which depicts the event, and a refinement text to adjust the images' semantics. To systematically benchmark model performance, we include 4 styles of reference images and 5 types of refinement texts, allowing us to explore model performance across different domains. We propose 3 adaptation methods that tailor existing models to our new setting and evaluate 10 SOTA models, ranging from specialized to large-scale foundation models. We believe this benchmark is an initial step toward investigating multimodal queries in video event localization.</description>

Abstract: Minigolf, a game with countless court layouts, and complex ball motion, constitutes a compelling real-world testbed for the study of embodied intelligence. As it not only challenges spatial and kinodynamic reasoning but also requires reflective and corrective capacities to address erroneously designed courses. We introduce RoboGolf, a framework that perceives dual-camera visual inputs with nested VLM-empowered closed-loop control and reflective equilibrium loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboGolf on challenging minigolf courts including those that are impossible to finish.</description>

      <title>CoLoR-Filter: Conditional Loss Reduction Filtering for Targeted Language Model Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting high-quality data for pre-training is crucial in shaping the downstream task performance of language models. A major challenge lies in identifying this optimal subset, a problem generally considered intractable, thus necessitating scalable and effective heuristics. In this work, we propose a data selection method, CoLoR-Filter (Conditional Loss Reduction Filtering), which leverages an empirical Bayes-inspired approach to derive a simple and computationally efficient selection criterion based on the relative loss values of two auxiliary models.
  In addition to the modeling rationale, we evaluate CoLoR-Filter empirically on two language modeling tasks: (1) selecting data from C4 for domain adaptation to evaluation on Books and (2) selecting data from C4 for a suite of downstream multiple-choice question answering tasks. We demonstrate favorable scaling both as we subselect more aggressively and using small auxiliary models to select data for large target models. As one headline result, CoLoR-Filter data selected using a pair of 150m parameter auxiliary models can train a 1.2b parameter target model to match a 1.2b parameter model trained on 25b randomly selected tokens with 25x less data for Books and 11x less data for the downstream tasks.

      <title>Connecting the Dots: Evaluating Abstract Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs Using the New York Times Connections Word Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The New York Times Connections game has emerged as a popular and challenging pursuit for word puzzle enthusiasts. We collect 200 Connections games to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) against expert and novice human players. Our results show that even the best-performing LLM, GPT-4o, which has otherwise shown impressive reasoning abilities on a wide variety of benchmarks, can only fully solve 8% of the games. Compared to GPT-4o, novice and expert players perform better, with expert human players significantly outperforming GPT-4o. To deepen our understanding we create a taxonomy of the knowledge types required to successfully categorize words in the Connections game, revealing that LLMs struggle with associative, encyclopedic, and linguistic knowledge. Our findings establish the New York Times Connections game as a challenging benchmark for evaluating abstract reasoning capabilities in humans and AI systems.</description>

      <title>AIC MLLM: Autonomous Interactive Correction MLLM for Robust Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to reflect on and correct failures is crucial for robotic systems to interact stably with real-life objects.Observing the generalization and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), previous approaches have aimed to utilize these models to enhance robotic systems accordingly.However, these methods typically focus on high-level planning corrections using an additional MLLM, with limited utilization of failed samples to correct low-level contact poses. To address this gap, we propose an Autonomous Interactive Correction (AIC) MLLM, which makes use of previous low-level interaction experiences to correct SE(3) pose predictions. Specifically, AIC MLLM is initially fine-tuned to acquire both pose prediction and feedback prompt comprehension abilities.We carefully design two types of prompt instructions through interactions with objects: 1) visual masks to highlight unmovable parts for position correction, and 2)textual descriptions to indicate potential directions for rotation correction.During inference, a Feedback Information Extraction module is introduced to recognize the failure cause, allowing AIC MLLM to adaptively correct the pose prediction using the corresponding prompts. To further enhance manipulation stability, we devise a Test Time Adaptation strategy that enables AIC MLLM to better adapt to the current scene configuration.Finally, extensive experiments are conducted in both simulated and real-world environments to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our AIC MLLM can efficiently correct failure samples by leveraging interaction experience prompts.Real-world demonstration can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/aic-mllm</description>

      <title>Transcendence: Generative Models Can Outperform The Experts That Train Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models are trained with the simple objective of imitating the conditional probability distribution induced by the data they are trained on. Therefore, when trained on data generated by humans, we may not expect the artificial model to outperform the humans on their original objectives. In this work, we study the phenomenon of transcendence: when a generative model achieves capabilities that surpass the abilities of the experts generating its data. We demonstrate transcendence by training an autoregressive transformer to play chess from game transcripts, and show that the trained model can sometimes achieve better performance than all players in the dataset. We theoretically prove that transcendence can be enabled by low-temperature sampling, and rigorously assess this claim experimentally. Finally, we discuss other sources of transcendence, laying the groundwork for future investigation of this phenomenon in a broader setting.</description>

      <title>DASSF: Dynamic-Attention Scale-Sequence Fusion for Aerial Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of small objects in aerial images is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision. Moving objects in aerial photography have problems such as different shapes and sizes, dense overlap, occlusion by the background, and object blur, however, the original YOLO algorithm has low overall detection accuracy due to its weak ability to perceive targets of different scales. In order to improve the detection accuracy of densely overlapping small targets and fuzzy targets, this paper proposes a dynamic-attention scale-sequence fusion algorithm (DASSF) for small target detection in aerial images. First, we propose a dynamic scale sequence feature fusion (DSSFF) module that improves the up-sampling mechanism and reduces computational load. Secondly, a x-small object detection head is specially added to enhance the detection capability of small targets. Finally, in order to improve the expressive ability of targets of different types and sizes, we use the dynamic head (DyHead). The model we proposed solves the problem of small target detection in aerial images and can be applied to multiple different versions of the YOLO algorithm, which is universal. Experimental results show that when the DASSF method is applied to YOLOv8, compared to YOLOv8n, on the VisDrone-2019 and DIOR datasets, the model shows an increase of 9.2% and 2.4% in the mean average precision (mAP), respectively, and outperforms the current mainstream methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide range of machine learning algorithms iteratively add data to the training sample. Examples include semi-supervised learning, active learning, multi-armed bandits, and Bayesian optimization. We embed this kind of data addition into decision theory by framing data selection as a decision problem. This paves the way for finding Bayes-optimal selections of data. For the illustrative case of self-training in semi-supervised learning, we derive the respective Bayes criterion. We further show that deploying this criterion mitigates the issue of confirmation bias by empirically assessing our method for generalized linear models, semi-parametric generalized additive models, and Bayesian neural networks on simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Conditional score-based diffusion models for solving inverse problems in mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to perform Bayesian inference using conditional score-based diffusion models to solve a class of inverse problems in mechanics involving the inference of a specimen's spatially varying material properties from noisy measurements of its mechanical response to loading. Conditional score-based diffusion models are generative models that learn to approximate the score function of a conditional distribution using samples from the joint distribution. More specifically, the score functions corresponding to multiple realizations of the measurement are approximated using a single neural network, the so-called score network, which is subsequently used to sample the posterior distribution using an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme based on Langevin dynamics. Training the score network only requires simulating the forward model. Hence, the proposed approach can accommodate black-box forward models and complex measurement noise. Moreover, once the score network has been trained, it can be re-used to solve the inverse problem for different realizations of the measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a suite of high-dimensional inverse problems in mechanics that involve inferring heterogeneous material properties from noisy measurements. Some examples we consider involve synthetic data, while others include data collected from actual elastography experiments. Further, our applications demonstrate that the proposed approach can handle different measurement modalities, complex patterns in the inferred quantities, non-Gaussian and non-additive noise models, and nonlinear black-box forward models. The results show that the proposed framework can solve large-scale physics-based inverse problems efficiently.</description>

      <title>Surgical Triplet Recognition via Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition is an essential building block to enable next-generation context-aware operating rooms. The goal is to identify the combinations of instruments, verbs, and targets presented in surgical video frames. In this paper, we propose DiffTriplet, a new generative framework for surgical triplet recognition employing the diffusion model, which predicts surgical triplets via iterative denoising. To handle the challenge of triplet association, two unique designs are proposed in our diffusion framework, i.e., association learning and association guidance. During training, we optimize the model in the joint space of triplets and individual components to capture the dependencies among them. At inference, we integrate association constraints into each update of the iterative denoising process, which refines the triplet prediction using the information of individual components. Experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets show the superiority of the proposed method in achieving a new state-of-the-art performance for surgical triplet recognition. Our codes will be released.</description>

      <title>GenAI-Bench: Evaluating and Improving Compositional Text-to-Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While text-to-visual models now produce photo-realistic images and videos, they struggle with compositional text prompts involving attributes, relationships, and higher-order reasoning such as logic and comparison. In this work, we conduct an extensive human study on GenAI-Bench to evaluate the performance of leading image and video generation models in various aspects of compositional text-to-visual generation. We also compare automated evaluation metrics against our collected human ratings and find that VQAScore -- a metric measuring the likelihood that a VQA model views an image as accurately depicting the prompt -- significantly outperforms previous metrics such as CLIPScore. In addition, VQAScore can improve generation in a black-box manner (without finetuning) via simply ranking a few (3 to 9) candidate images. Ranking by VQAScore is 2x to 3x more effective than other scoring methods like PickScore, HPSv2, and ImageReward at improving human alignment ratings for DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, especially on compositional prompts that require advanced visio-linguistic reasoning. We will release a new GenAI-Rank benchmark with over 40,000 human ratings to evaluate scoring metrics on ranking images generated from the same prompt. Lastly, we discuss promising areas for improvement in VQAScore, such as addressing fine-grained visual details. We will release all human ratings (over 80,000) to facilitate scientific benchmarking of both generative models and automated metrics.</description>

      <title>Deep Optimal Experimental Design for Parameter Estimation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal experimental design is a well studied field in applied science and engineering. Techniques for estimating such a design are commonly used within the framework of parameter estimation. Nonetheless, in recent years parameter estimation techniques are changing rapidly with the introduction of deep learning techniques to replace traditional estimation methods. This in turn requires the adaptation of optimal experimental design that is associated with these new techniques. In this paper we investigate a new experimental design methodology that uses deep learning. We show that the training of a network as a Likelihood Free Estimator can be used to significantly simplify the design process and circumvent the need for the computationally expensive bi-level optimization problem that is inherent in optimal experimental design for non-linear systems. Furthermore, deep design improves the quality of the recovery process for parameter estimation problems. As proof of concept we apply our methodology to two different systems of Ordinary Differential Equations.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Movement and Naive Predictions for Point Forecasting in Univariate Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for point forecasting in univariate random walks often fail to surpass naive benchmarks due to data unpredictability. This study introduces a novel forecasting method that fuses movement prediction (binary classification) with naive forecasts for accurate one-step-ahead point forecasting. The method's efficacy is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, simulations, and real-world data experiments. It reliably exceeds naive forecasts with movement prediction accuracies as low as 0.55, outperforming baseline models like ARIMA, linear regression, MLP, and LSTM networks in forecasting the S\&amp;P 500 index and Bitcoin prices. This method is particularly advantageous when accurate point predictions are challenging but accurate movement predictions are attainable, translating movement predictions into point forecasts in random walk contexts.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Approach for Tissue Classification using Acoustic Waves during Ablation with an Er:YAG Laser (Updated)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's mechanical tools for bone cutting (osteotomy) cause mechanical trauma that prolongs the healing process. Medical device manufacturers aim to minimize this trauma, with minimally invasive surgery using laser cutting as one innovation. This method ablates tissue using laser light instead of mechanical tools, reducing post-surgery healing time. A reliable feedback system is crucial during laser surgery to prevent damage to surrounding tissues. We propose a tissue classification method analyzing acoustic waves generated during laser ablation, demonstrating its applicability in an ex-vivo experiment. The ablation process with a microsecond pulsed Er:YAG laser produces acoustic waves, acquired with an air-coupled transducer. These waves were used to classify five porcine tissue types: hard bone, soft bone, muscle, fat, and skin. For automated tissue classification, we compared five Neural Network (NN) approaches: a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with time-dependent input, a Fully-connected Neural Network (FcNN) with either the frequency spectrum or principal components of the frequency spectrum as input, and a combination of a CNN and an FcNN with time-dependent data and its frequency spectrum as input. Consecutive acoustic waves were used to improve classification accuracy. Grad-Cam identified the activation map of the frequencies, showing low frequencies as the most important for this task. Our results indicated that combining time-dependent data with its frequency spectrum achieved the highest classification accuracy (65.5%-75.5%). We also found that using the frequency spectrum alone was sufficient, with no additional benefit from applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA).</description>

      <title>Relation Extraction with Fine-Tuned Large Language Models in Retrieval Augmented Generation Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information Extraction (IE) is crucial for converting unstructured data into structured formats like Knowledge Graphs (KGs). A key task within IE is Relation Extraction (RE), which identifies relationships between entities in text. Various RE methods exist, including supervised, unsupervised, weakly supervised, and rule-based approaches. Recent studies leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown significant success in this area. In the current era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning these models can overcome limitations associated with zero-shot LLM prompting-based RE methods, especially regarding domain adaptation challenges and identifying implicit relations between entities in sentences. These implicit relations, which cannot be easily extracted from a sentence's dependency tree, require logical inference for accurate identification. This work explores the performance of fine-tuned LLMs and their integration into the Retrieval Augmented-based (RAG) RE approach to address the challenges of identifying implicit relations at the sentence level, particularly when LLMs act as generators within the RAG framework. Empirical evaluations on the TACRED, TACRED-Revisited (TACREV), Re-TACRED, and SemEVAL datasets show significant performance improvements with fine-tuned LLMs, including Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and T5 (Large). Notably, our approach achieves substantial gains on SemEVAL, where implicit relations are common, surpassing previous results on this dataset. Additionally, our method outperforms previous works on TACRED, TACREV, and Re-TACRED, demonstrating exceptional performance across diverse evaluation scenarios.</description>

      <title>VideoScore: Building Automatic Metrics to Simulate Fine-grained Human Feedback for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent years have witnessed great advances in video generation. However, the development of automatic video metrics is lagging significantly behind. None of the existing metric is able to provide reliable scores over generated videos. The main barrier is the lack of large-scale human-annotated dataset. In this paper, we release VideoFeedback, the first large-scale dataset containing human-provided multi-aspect score over 37.6K synthesized videos from 11 existing video generative models. We train VideoScore (initialized from Mantis) based on VideoFeedback to enable automatic video quality assessment. Experiments show that the Spearman correlation between VideoScore and humans can reach 77.1 on VideoFeedback-test, beating the prior best metrics by about 50 points. Further result on other held-out EvalCrafter, GenAI-Bench, and VBench show that VideoScore has consistently much higher correlation with human judges than other metrics. Due to these results, we believe VideoScore can serve as a great proxy for human raters to (1) rate different video models to track progress (2) simulate fine-grained human feedback in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve current video generation models.</description>
