      <title>The Dynamical History of the Kepler-221 Planet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kepler-221 is a G-type star hosting four planets. In this system, planets b, c, and e are in (or near) a 6:3:1 three-body resonance even though the planets' period ratios show significant departures from exact two-body commensurability. Importantly, the intermediate planet d is not part of the resonance chain. To reach this resonance configuration, we propose a scenario in which there were originally five planets in the system in a chain of first-order resonances. After disk dispersal, the resonance chain became unstable and two planets quickly merged to become the current planet d. In addition, the b/c/e three-body resonance was re-established. We run N-body simulations using REBOUND to investigate the parameter space under which this scenario can operate. We find that our envisioned scenario is possible when certain conditions are met. First, the reformation of the three-body resonance after planet merging requires convergent migration between planets b and c. Second, as has previously pointed out, an efficient damping mechanism must operate to power the expansion of the b/c/e system. We find that planet d plays a crucial role during the orbital expansion phase due to destabilizing encounters of a three-body resonance between c, d, and e. A successful orbital expansion phase puts constraints on the planet properties in the Kepler-221 system including the planet mass ratios and the tidal quality factors for the planets. Our model can also be applied to other planet systems in resonance, such as Kepler-402 and K2-138.</description>

      <title>JWST sighting of decameter main-belt asteroids and view on meteorite sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroid discoveries are essential for planetary-defense efforts aiming to prevent impacts with Earth, including the more frequent megaton explosions from decameter impactors. While large asteroids ($\geq$100 km) have remained in the main belt since their formation, small asteroids are commonly transported to the near-Earth object (NEO) population. However, due to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size-frequency distribution--which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth--varies significantly among models. Here, we report 138 detections of the smallest asteroids ($\gtrapprox $10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST's infrared capabilities covering the asteroids' emission peaks and synthetic tracking techniques. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the objects' distances and phase angles using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their size-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ${\sim}100$ m (debiased cumulative slopes of $q = -2.66\pm0.60$ and $-0.97\pm0.14$ for diameters smaller and larger than $\sim $100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple asteroid families--most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia--according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families and the source regions of meteorites "in-situ".</description>

      <title>Resolving the Super-Earth/Gas Giant Connection in Stellar Mass and Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed correlation between inner super-Earths and outer gas giants places strong constraints on formation theories. Building on previous work, Bryan $\&amp;$ Lee 2024 showed that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between super-Earths and outer gas giants around metal-rich FGK stars, and that this correlation disappears for metal-poor hosts. Here we consider how this connection evolves across stellar mass. Starting with our sample of 85 M-dwarfs ($&lt;$0.6 M$_{\odot}$) hosting inner super-Earths, we calculate P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$&gt;$0) = 9.4 (+10.2 -3.1)$\%$ and P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$\leq$0)$&lt;$3.1$\%$. Compared to the field gas giant frequency calculated from the Rosenthal et al 2021 sample, we find P(GG|[Fe/H]$&gt;$0) = 10.3 (+6.9 -3.1)$\%$, and P(GG|[Fe/H]$\leq$0)$&lt;$2.6$\%$ for M-dwarfs. While we see a higher gas giant frequency around metal-rich M-dwarfs for both samples, we find no significant correlations between super-Earths and gas giants. Combining our 85 M-dwarf sample with our FGK sample from Bryan $\&amp;$ Lee 2024, we resolve the SE/GG correlation in stellar mass (0.3--1.5 M$_{\odot}$) and metallicity. We show the positive correlation emerges in metal-rich K-dwarfs and strengthens with increasing stellar mass. Gas giant properties also impact the correlation -- for metal rich stars, the positive correlation is strengthened by: 1) dynamically hot gas giants for all stellar masses; 2) distant gas giants only for higher mass stars; and 3) single gas giants for K-dwarfs and multiple gas giants around more massive stars. We discuss how the stellar mass dependence of the inner-outer planet correlation can be understood from the increasing disk mass budget for higher mass stars.</description>

      <title>Polydisperse Formation of Planetesimals: The dust size distribution in clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streaming instability is an efficient method for overcoming the barriers to planet formation in protoplanetary discs. The streaming instability has been extensively modelled by hydrodynamic simulations of gas and a single dust size. However, more recent studies considering a more realistic case of a particle size distribution show that this will significantly decrease the growth rate of the instability. We follow up on these studies by evaluating the polydisperse streaming instability, looking at the non-linear phase of the instability at the highest density regions, and investigating the dust size distribution in the densest dust structures. We employ 2D hydrodynamic simulations in an unstratified shearing box with multiple dust species representing an underlying continuous dust size spectrum using FARGO3D. To calculate the drag force on the gas due to a continuous dust size distribution, we apply the Gauss-Legendre quadrature method in dust size space. This method converges faster with the number of dust species than the usual uniform sampling method. The polydisperse streaming instability is less efficient than its monodisperse counterpart in generating dense clumps that could collapse into planetesimals. In the densest dust structure, the larger dust sizes are more abundant because they are less coupled to the gas and, therefore, can clump together more than the smaller dust grains. This trend is broken at the largest dust size due to size-dependent spatial segregation of the highest-density regions, where particles with the largest Stokes numbers are located just outside the densest areas of the combined dust species. This is observed as a peak in the size distribution at the densest regions, which could relate to the size distribution that ends up in the planetesimal after collapse and can mimic the size distribution of dust growth.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Chemical Evolution of Hydrocarbons Through Carbon Grain Supply in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas present in planet-forming disks typically exhibits strong emission features of abundant carbon and oxygen molecular carriers. In some instances, protoplanetary disks show an elevated C/O ratio above interstellar values, which leads to a rich hydrocarbon chemistry evidenced in the mid-infrared spectra. The origin of this strengthened C/O ratio may stem from the release of less complex hydrocarbons from the chemical processing of carbonaceous grains. We have explored a set of 42 single-cell models in which we match the physical conditions to the inner regions of planet-forming disks, while varying the C/O ratio by exploring different levels of CH$_4$, C, H$_2$O, and CO to the gas-phase chemistry, which we evaluate in both the cosmic/X-ray and UV-driven limit. We find that the carbon-bearing species in our models exhibit high dependencies on the driver of the chemistry, where both CO and long chain hydrocarbons act as carbon sinks in the cosmic/X-ray-driven chemistry limit, while the vast majority ends up in atomic carbon and CO in the UV-driven limit. We also find moderate dependencies upon the C/O ratio, where this and the ionization rate/UV field determines the point of peak production of a species as well as its equilibrium abundance. We also find that the production of several hydrocarbons, specifically C$_2$H$_2$, is strongly dependent up to an order of magnitude on the initial water abundance. We lastly find that in the X-ray-driven limit, both CH$_4$ and C serve as highly transient donor species to the carbon chemistry.</description>

      <title>Amplifying Resonant Repulsion with Inflated Young Planets, Overlooked Inner Planets, and Non-zero Initial $\Delta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most multi-planet systems around mature ($\sim 5$-Gyr-old) host stars are non-resonant. Even the near-resonant planet pairs still display 1-2\% positive deviation from perfect period commensurabilities ($\Delta$) near first-order mean motion resonances (MMR). Resonant repulsion due to eccentricity tides was one of the first mechanisms proposed to explain the observed positive $\Delta$. However, the inferred rates of tidal dissipation are often implausibly rapid (with a reduced tidal quality factor $Q_p^\prime \lesssim 10$). In this work, we attempt to amplify eccentricity tides with three previously ignored effects. 1) Planets tend to be inflated when they were younger. 2) Kepler-like Planets likely form as resonant chains parked at the disk inner edge, overlooked inner planets could have contributed to tidal dissipation of the whole system. 3) Disk migration captures planets into first-order MMR with non-zero initial deviation $\Delta$, thereby lowering the amount of dissipation needed. We show that even after accounting for all three effects, $Q_p^\prime$ can only be amplified by about one order of magnitude, and still falls short of $Q_p^\prime$ values of Solar System planets. Therefore, eccentricity tides alone cannot fully explain the observed $\Delta$ distribution. Other effects such as obliquity tides, planetesimal scattering, expanding disk inner edge, disk turbulence, divergent encounters, and dynamical instabilities must have contributed to dislodging planets from first-order MMR.</description>

      <title>From Streaming Instability to the Onset of Pebble Accretion I. Investigating the Growth Modes in Planetesimal Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The localized formation of planetesimals can be triggered with the help of streaming instability when the local pebble density is high. This can happen at various locations in the disk leading to the formation of local planetesimal rings. The planetesimals in these rings subsequently grow from mutual collisions and by pebble accretion. Aims. We investigate the early growth of protoplanetary embryos from a ring of planetesimals created from streaming instability to see if they reach sizes where they accrete pebbles efficiently. Methods. We simulate the early stages of planet formation for rings of planetesimals that we assume were created by streaming instability at various separations from the star and for various stellar masses using a semi-analytic model. Results. The rings in the inner disk are able to produce protoplanetary embryos in a short time whereas at large separations there is little to no growth. The growth of the largest bodies is significantly slower around lower-mass stars. Conclusions. The formation of planetary embryos from filaments during the disk lifetime is possible but strongly dependent on the separation from the star and the mass of the host star. It remains difficult to form the seeds of pebble accretion early in the outer disk \sim 50AU, especially for low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Dust supply to slose binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Binary systems can be born surrounded by circumbinary discs. The gaseous discs surrounding either of the two stellar companions can have their life extended by the supply of mass arriving from the circumbinary disc. Aims. The objective of this study is to investigate the gravitational interactions exerted by a compact and eccentric binary system on the circumbinary and circumprimary discs, and the resulting transport of gas and solids between the disc components. Methods. We assume that the gas in the system behaves as a fluid and model its evolution by means of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations. Dust grains are modeled as Lagrangian particles that interact with the gas and the stars. Results. Models indicate that significant fluxes of gas and dust proceed from the circumbinary disc toward the circumprimary disc. For the applied system parameters, grains of certain sizes are segregated outside the tidal gap generated by the stars. Consequently, the size distribution of the transported dust is not continuous but it presents a gap in the mm size range. In close binaries, the lifetime of an isolated circumprimary disc is found to be short, approximately 10 5 years, because of its small mass. However, because of the influx of gas from beyond the tidal gap, the disc around the primary star can survive much longer, about 10 6 years, as long as gas accretion from the circumbinary disc continues. The supply of solids and the extended lifetime of a circumbinary disc also aids in the possible formation of giant planets. Compared to close binary systems without a circumbinary disc, we expect a higher frequency of single- or multiple- planet systems. Additionally, a planetesimal or debris belt can form in proximity of the truncation radius of the circumprimary disc and/or around the location of the exterior edge of the tidal gap.</description>

      <title>The structure of $\kappa$ Cygnid and August Draconid meteoroid streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteoroid streams can be complex structures shaped by the processes of their formation and subsequent orbital evolution. The first step of their understanding is mapping their current stage. We used precise data from the European Fireball Network to disentangle the situation with meteor showers active in August and having radiants in the Cygnus-Draco area. In total, 179 fireballs observed between 2016-2024 were analyzed. We confirmed that two showers, $\kappa$ Cygnids and August Draconids, are present. The meteoroid swarm producing $\kappa$ Cygnids is locked in the 5:3 main-motion resonance with Jupiter with orbital period 7.12 years and has a limited extent of $\leq$ 90 degrees in mean anomaly. The shower is therefore markedly active only once or twice during each seven-year period. The orbits have wide range of inclinations, 28-44 degrees. There is a correlation between inclination, perihelion distance, and argument of perihelion due to observational selection effects. The radiant area is almost 30 degrees long in declination. August Draconids have even more extended radiant and can be divided into three branches depending on the position of the perihelion relative to the ecliptic plane. Neither of the showers can be described by a single set of orbital elements. We provide sets of representative orbits and identifications with showers previously reported in the literature. Physical properties of meteoroids and possible parent bodies are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Modelling a Transiting Circumbinary Disc in the HD98800 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present synthetic optical light curves of the hierarchical HD98800 quadruple system over a decade-long period when the circumbinary disc encircling the system's B binary is expected to eclipse the light from the A binary. We produce and compare light curves of this transit event using hydrodynamical models with different values of the disc's gas mass, dust mass, and $\alpha$-viscosity to determine the observable effect of each parameter. These comparisons provide insight that could aid in the analysis of observational data from the system when the real transit occurs and provide recommendations for how such observations should be made. We find that a higher dust mass or higher value of $\alpha$ correspond to a longer transit, with the gas mass having a more minor effect on the overall shape and duration of the transit. A higher $\alpha$ has an observable effect on the viscous spreading at the outer edge of the disc, though is countered through truncation by the outer binary. It is also shown that long-term interactions between the outer binary and disc can excite spiral arms in the disc, which introduce observable asymmetries to the light curve. Our models suggest that the transit should have begun at the time of writing, but no dimming has yet been observed. It is likely that the disc has a smaller radial extent than our models, due to a lower viscosity than can be simulated with SPH. The transit is expected to last 8-11 years, ending in late 2034 at the latest.</description>

      <title>Titan's Fluvial and Lacustrine Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter we begin with a review of Titan's fluvial and lacustrine landscapes as observed with Cassini remote sensing data, and what the many discoveries have revealed about Titan's surface materials and climate. Yet Cassini remote sensing data are coarse, topographic data are largely lacking, and the absence of in situ field measurements means we have little understanding of what the surface is composed of. At present, our knowledge of Titan's hydrology is comparable to that of Mars in the 1970's during the Viking era. Fortunately, the coming decades promise many new and exciting discoveries that can be achieved through Earth-based experiments, numerical modeling, and a continued commitment to the exploration of Titan by future missions, including both Dragonfly and orbiting assets. We therefore close the chapter with a discussion about what can be done with the current Cassini data and how new data, from both Dragonfly and a potential future orbiter, would allow us to leverage Titan to help solve some of the largest problems both here on Earth and on hydrologic planets and exoplanets more generally.</description>

      <title>MAISTEP -- a new grid-based machine learning tool for inferring stellar parameters I. Ages of giant-planet host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of exoplanet demographics partly depends on their corresponding host star parameters. With the majority of exoplanet-host stars having only atmospheric constraints available, robust inference of their parameters is susceptible to the approach used. The goal of this work is to develop a grid-based machine learning tool capable of determining the stellar radius, mass, and age using only atmospheric constraints and to analyse the age distribution of stars hosting giant planets. Our machine learning approach involves combining four tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost) trained on a grid of stellar models to infer stellar radius, mass, and age using Teff, [Fe/H], and luminosities. We perform a detailed statistical analysis to compare the inferences of our tool with those based on seismic data from the APOKASC and LEGACY samples. Finally, we apply our tool to determine the ages of stars hosting giant planets. Comparing the stellar parameter inferences from our machine learning tool with those from the APOKASC and LEGACY, we find a bias (and a scatter) of -0.5\% (5\%) and -0.2\% (2\%) in radius, 6\% (5\%) per cent and -2\% (3\%) in mass, and -9\% (16\%) and 7\% (23\%) in age, respectively. Therefore, our machine learning predictions are commensurate with seismic inferences. When applying our model to a sample of stars hosting Jupiter-mass planets, we find the average age estimates for the hosts of Hot Jupiters, Warm Jupiters, and Cold Jupiters to be 1.98, 2.98, and 3.51 Gyr, respectively. These statistical ages of the host stars confirm previous predictions - based on stellar model ages for a relatively small number of hosts, as well as on the average age-velocity dispersion relation - that stars hosting Hot Jupiters are statistically younger than those hosting Warm and Cold Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Short-Period Small Planets with High Mutual Inclinations are more Common around Metal-Rich Stars</title>

Abstract: We present a correlation between the stellar metallicities and the mutual inclinations of multi-planet systems hosting short-period small planets (a/Rs&lt;12, Rp&lt;4Re). We analyzed 89 multi-planet systems discovered by Kepler, K2, and TESS, where the innermost planets have periods shorter than 10 days. We found that the mutual inclinations of the innermost two planets are higher and more diverse around metal-rich stars. The mutual inclinations are calculated as the absolute differences between the best-fit inclinations of the innermost two planets from transit modeling, which represent the lower limits of the true mutual inclinations. The mean and variance of the mutual inclination distribution of the metal-rich systems are 3.1+-0.5 and 3.1+-0.4 degrees, while for the metal-poor systems they are 1.3+-0.2 and 1.0+-0.2 degrees. This finding suggests that inner planetary systems around metal-rich stars are dynamically hotter. We summarized the theories that could plausibly explain this correlation, including the influence of giant planets, higher solid densities in protoplanetary disks around metal-rich stars, or secular chaos coupled with an excess of angular momentum deficits. Planet formation and population synthesis models tracking the mutual inclination evolution would be essential to fully understand this correlation.</description>

      <title>The SAP-1 Payload: A Technology Demonstration for Space-Based Microbiology Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SSPACE Astrobiology Payload (SAP) series, starting with the SAP-1 project is designed to conduct in-situ microbiology experiments in low earth orbit. This payload series aims to understand the behaviour of microbial organisms in space, particularly those critical for human health, and the corresponding effects due to microgravity and solar/galactic radiation. SAP-1 focuses on studying Bacillus clausii and Bacillus coagulans, bacteria beneficial to humans. It aims to provide a space laboratory for astrobiology experiments under microgravity conditions. The hardware developed for these experiments is indigenous and tailored to meet the unique requirements of autonomous microbiology experiments by controlling pressure, temperature, and nutrition flow to bacteria. A rotating platform, which forms the core design, is innovatively utilised to regulate the flow and mixing of nutrients with dormant bacteria. The technology demonstration models developed at SSPACE have yielded promising results, with ongoing efforts to refine, adapt for space conditions, and prepare for integration with nanosatellites or space modules. The anticipated payload will be compact, approximately 1U in size (10cm x 10cm x 10cm), consume less than 5W power, and offer flexibility for various microbiological studies.</description>
