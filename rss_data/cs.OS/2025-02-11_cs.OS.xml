      <title>XPUTimer: Anomaly Diagnostics for Divergent LLM Training in GPU Clusters of Thousand-Plus Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models has driven the need for efficient GPU training clusters. However, ensuring high-performance training in these clusters is challenging due to the complexity of software-hardware interactions and the frequent occurrence of training anomalies. Since existing diagnostic tools are narrowly tailored to specific issues, there are gaps in their ability to address anomalies spanning the entire training stack. In response, we introduce XPUTimer, a real-time diagnostic framework designed for distributed LLM training at scale. XPUTimer first integrates a lightweight tracing daemon to monitor key code segments with minimal overhead. Additionally, it features a diagnostic engine that employs novel intra-kernel tracing and holistic aggregated metrics to efficiently identify and resolve anomalies. Deployment of XPUTimer across 6,000 GPUs over eight months demonstrated significant improvements across the training stack, validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Automatic ISA analysis for Secure Context Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction set architectures are complex, with hundreds of registers and instructions that can modify dozens of them during execution, variably on each instance. Prose-style ISA specifications struggle to capture these intricacies of the ISAs, where often the important details about a single register are spread out across hundreds of pages of documentation. Ensuring that all ISA-state is swapped in context switch implementations of privileged software requires meticulous examination of these pages. This manual process is tedious and error-prone.
  We propose a tool called Sailor that leverages machine-readable ISA specifications written in Sail to automate this task. Sailor determines the ISA-state necessary to swap during the context switch using the data collected from Sail and a novel algorithm to classify ISA-state as security-sensitive. Using Sailor's output, we identify three different classes of mishandled ISA-state across four open-source confidential computing systems. We further reveal five distinct security vulnerabilities that can be exploited using the mishandled ISA-state. This research exposes an often overlooked attack surface that stems from mishandled ISA-state, enabling unprivileged adversaries to exploit system vulnerabilities.</description>
