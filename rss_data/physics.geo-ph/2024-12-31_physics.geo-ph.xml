      <title>A Theory for Wind Work on Oceanic Mesoscales and Submesoscales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies focused primarily on wind stress being proportional to wind velocity relative to the ocean velocity, which induces a curl in wind stress with polarity opposite to the ocean mesoscale vorticity, resulting in net negative wind work. However, there remains a fundamental gap in understanding how wind work on the ocean is related to the ocean's vortical and straining motions. While it is possible to derive budgets for ocean vorticity and strain, these do not provide the energy channeled into vortical and straining motions by wind stress. An occasional misconception is that a Helmholtz decomposition can separate vorticity from strain, with the latter mistakenly regarded as being solely due to the potential flow accounting for divergent motions. In fact, strain is also an essential constituent of divergence-free (or solenoidal) flows, including the oceanic mesoscales in geostrophic balance where strain-dominated regions account for approximately half the KE. There is no existing fluid dynamics framework that relates the injection of kinetic energy by a force to how this energy is deposited into vortical and straining motions. Here, we show that winds, on average, are just as effective at damping straining motions as they are at damping vortical motions. This happens because oceanic strain induces a straining wind stress gradient (WSG), which is analogous to ocean vorticity inducing a curl in wind stress. Ocean-induced WSGs alone, whether straining or vortical, always damp ocean currents. However, our theory also reveals that a significant contribution to wind work comes from inherent wind gradients, a main component of which is due to prevailing winds of the general atmospheric circulation. We find that inherent WSGs lead to asymmetric energization of ocean weather based on the polarity of vortical and straining ocean flows.</description>

      <title>Changes in seismicity in a volcanically active region of the Izu Peninsula, Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eastern side of the Izu Peninsula in Japan is volcanically and seismically active. In this region, earthquake swarms of ordinary earthquakes frequently occur at shallow depths, and this is considered to be associated with magma intrusion. Beneath ordinary earthquakes, low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) are infrequently observed. To better understand the characteristics of LFEs, we produced an LFE catalog for 2005-2020, using the matched-filter method. We then conducted a timeseries analysis based on the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence model, showing relative quiescence (change in occurrence rate, which became quiet). For comparison, the same analysis was conducted by using the Japan Meteorological Agency catalog of ordinary earthquakes, showing a similar result. The change points for both types of earthquakes fell sometime between late 2009 and mid-2013, during which two out of three swarms of ordinary earthquakes occurred. We associated the quiescence with a decrease in background rate, where background rate, by removing the triggering effect of aftershocks, is known to be caused directly by the magma source, which can vary with time. We further discussed surface displacement data obtained from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, showing that the uplift due to magma intrusion was significant during the 1970s-1990s, although it was in abatement or unobservable during the study period (2005-2020). We interpreted the quiescence with no significant uplift as an indication that magma source, which caused magma intrusion into the study region, is in a transition phase, becoming less active, compared with the magma source during the 1970s-1990s.</description>

      <title>Physically Guided Deep Unsupervised Inversion for 1D Magnetotelluric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global demand for unconventional energy sources such as geothermal energy and white hydrogen requires new exploration techniques for precise subsurface structure characterization and potential reservoir identification. The Magnetotelluric (MT) method is crucial for these tasks, providing critical information on the distribution of subsurface electrical resistivity at depths ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters. However, traditional iterative algorithm-based inversion methods require the adjustment of multiple parameters, demanding time-consuming and exhaustive tuning processes to achieve proper cost function minimization. Although recent advances have incorporated deep learning algorithms for MT inversion, primarily based on supervised learning, \paul{and} needs large labeled datasets for training. This work utilizes TensorFlow operations to create a differentiable forward MT operator, leveraging its automatic differentiation capability. Moreover, instead of solving for the subsurface model directly, as classical algorithms perform, this paper presents a new deep unsupervised inversion algorithm guided by physics to estimate 1D MT models. Instead of using datasets with the observed data and their respective model as labels during training, our method employs a differentiable modeling operator that physically guides the cost function minimization, making the proposed method solely dependent on observed data. Therefore, the optimization \paul{algorithm} updates the network weights to minimize the data misfit. We test the proposed method with field and synthetic data at different acquisition frequencies, demonstrating that the resistivity models obtained are more accurate than those calculated using other techniques.</description>

      <title>A Point-cloud Clustering &amp; Tracking Algorithm for Radar Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In data mining, density-based clustering, which entails classifying datapoints according to their distributions in some space, is an essential method to extract information from large datasets. With the advent of software-based radio, ionospheric radars are capable of producing unprecedentedly large datasets of plasma turbulence backscatter observations, and new automatic techniques are needed to sift through them. We present an algorithm to automatically identify and track clusters of radar echoes through time, using \texttt{dbscan}, a celebrated density-based clustering method for noisy point-clouds. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficiency by tracking turbulent structures in the E-region ionosphere, the so-called radar aurora. Through conjugate auroral imagery, as well as \emph{in-situ} satellite observations, we demonstrate that the observed turbulent structures generally track the motion of auroras. What is more, the radar aurora bulk motions exhibit key qualities of auroral electric field enhancements that has previously been observed with various instruments. We present preliminary statistical results using our new method, and briefly discuss the method's limitations and potential future adaptations.</description>
