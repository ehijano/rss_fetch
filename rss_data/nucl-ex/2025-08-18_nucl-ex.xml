      <title>Isomeric yield ratios and mass spectrometry of Y and Nb isotopes in the neutron-rich N=60 region: the unusual case of $^{98}$Y</title>

Abstract: The isomeric yield ratio (IYR) of fission products is an observable that carries relevant information about the fragments emerging from the scission of a fissioning nucleus. We report on IYR of $^{96,98,100}$Y and $^{100,102}$Nb, together with the previously reported values for $^{97}$Y and $^{99}$Nb, produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-induced fission of $^{232}$Th at the Ion Guide Isotope Separation On-Line (IGISOL) facility of the University of Jyv{\"a}skyl{\"a}. We measured the IYR using two different techniques, the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance (PI-ICR) and the multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MR-TOF-MS) methods. Moreover, we measured the masses of the long-lived isomeric states in $^{98,100}$Y and $^{100,102}$Nb populated via in-trap $\beta$-decay of their precursors. Since the $\beta$-decay selectively populates states with a favourable spin-parity, we could identify the measured state and show that in all cases except $^{102}$Nb the ground state is the low-spin state. This measurement confirms the spin-parity assignments of all the nuclei as they are reported on the ENSDF evaluations, disagreeing with the assignment for $^{100}$Y reported on the NUBASE2020 evaluation.
  Making also use of previously reported data, we observe an anomalously low IYR for the $N=59$ isotope $^{98}$Y as compared to other yttrium or neighboring niobium isotopes. This behavior is very rare across the nuclear chart and is posited to be connected to the characteristic shape coexistence of $^{98}$Y and to the change in the charge radii of the ground and excited states in the $N=58-60$ region.</description>

      <title>Particle identification in the GlueX detector with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In particle physics experiments, identifying the types of particles registered in a detector is essential for the accurate reconstruction of particle collisions. At Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), the GlueX experiment performs particle identification (PID) by setting specific thresholds, known as cuts, on the kinematic properties of tracks and showers obtained from detector hits. Our research aims to enhance this cut-based method by employing machine-learning algorithms based on multi-layer perceptrons and boosted decision trees. Similar approaches have been applied in other particle physics experiments and offer an opportunity to increase PID accuracies using reconstructed kinematic data. Our study illustrates that both MLPs and BDTs can identify charged and neutral particles in Monte Carlo (MC) simulated GlueX data with significantly improved accuracy over the current cuts-based PID method.</description>
