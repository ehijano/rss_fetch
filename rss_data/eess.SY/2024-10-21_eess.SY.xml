      <title>A Physics-Based Context-Aware Approach for Anomaly Detection in Teleoperated Driving Operations Under False Data Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperated driving (ToD) systems are a special type of cyber-physical system (CPS) where the operator remotely controls the steering, acceleration, and braking actions of the vehicle. Malicious actors may inject false data into communication channels to manipulate the teleoperator's driving commands to cause harm. Hence, protection of this communication is necessary for a safe operation of the target vehicle. However, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, protection is not enough, and detecting an attack is necessary. Moreover, UN R155 mandates that vehicle fleets detect and log security incidents. Thus, the cyber-physical threats of ToD are modeled using the attack-centric approach in this paper. Then, an attack model with false data injection (FDI) on the steering control command is created from real vehicle data. A risk of this attack model is assessed for a last-mile delivery (LMD) application. Finally, a physics-based context-aware anomaly detection system (PCADS) is proposed to detect such false injection attacks, and preliminary experimental results are presented to validate the model.</description>

      <title>Resilience-Oriented DG Siting and Sizing Considering Energy Equity Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather events can cause widespread power outages and huge economic losses. Low-income customers are more vulnerable to power outages because they live in areas with poorly equipped distribution systems. However, existing approaches to improve grid resilience focus on the overall condition of the system and ignore the outage experiences of low-income customers, which leads to significant energy inequities in resilience. Therefore, this paper explores a new resilience-oriented planning method for distributed generator (DG) siting and sizing, by embedding an additional energy equity constraint (EEC). First, the expected load shedding index (ELSI) is defined as the ratio of the load shedding to the original load, which quantifies the resilience-oriented energy equity. Then, the DG siting and sizing problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming with the EEC. The first stage determines the optimal sites and sizes of DG units under investment constraints and EECs, while the second stage optimizes expected costs of unserved load. A subsidiary variable is introduced to ensure the model's solvability. Finally, numerical studies are performed on the IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DG planning model in achieving energy equity. Three observations are presented as future guidelines for resilience-oriented DG planning.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume method and observability analysis for core-shell enhanced single particle model for lithium iron phosphate batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries in Electric Vehicles is driven by their affordability, abundant material supply, and safety advantages. However, challenges arise in controlling/estimating unmeasurable LFP states such as state of charge (SOC), due to its flat open circuit voltage, hysteresis, and path dependence dynamics during intercalation and de-intercalation processes. The Core Shell Average Enhanced Single Particle Model (CSa-ESPM) effectively captures the electrochemical dynamics and phase transition behavior of LFP batteries by means of Partial Differential-Algebraic Equations (PDAEs). These governing PDAEs, including a moving boundary Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), require a fine-grained spatial grid for accurate and stable solutions when employing the Finite Difference Method (FDM). This, in turn, leads to a computationally expensive system intractable for the design of real-time battery management system algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that the Finite Volume Method (FVM) effectively discretizes the CSa-ESPM and provides accurate solutions with fewer than 4 control volumes while ensuring mass conservation across multi ple operational cycles. The resulting control-oriented reduced order FVM-based CSa-ESPM is experimentally validated using various C-rate load profiles and its observability is assessed through nonlinear observability analysis. Our results reveal that different current inputs and discrete equation numbers influence model observability, with non-observable regions identified where solid-phase concentration gradients are negligible.</description>

      <title>Inverter Output Impedance Estimation in Power Networks: A Variable Direction Forgetting Recursive-Least-Square Algorithm Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As inverter-based loads and energy sources become increasingly prevalent, accurate line impedance estimation between inverters and the grid is essential for optimizing performance and enhancing control strategies. This paper presents a non-invasive estimation algorithm that avoids signal injection, based on the Variable Direction Forgetting Recursive Least Squares (VDF-RLS) method. The method uses measurement data that is local to the inverter. It proposes a specific method for determining rotational frequency for direct-quadrature (dq) coordinate frame in which data is collected, which ensures a simpler and more accurate estimation. This method is enabled by a secondary Phase Locked Loop (PLL) which appropriately attenuates the effects of variations in grid-voltage measurements. By isolating the variation-sensitive q-axis and relying solely on the less sensitive d-axis, the method further minimizes the impact of variations. The estimation method achieves rapid adaptation while ensuring stability in the absence of persistent excitation by selectively discarding outdated data during updates. Results demonstrate significant improvement (as large as 7 times) in estimation of line parameters, when compared to existing approaches such as constant forgetting RLS.</description>

      <title>Robustness to Model Approximation, Learning, and Sample Complexity in Wasserstein Regular MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the robustness property of discrete-time stochastic optimal control for Wasserstein model approximation under various performance criteria. Specifically, we study the performance loss when applying an optimal policy designed for an approximate model to the true dynamics compared with the optimal cost for the true model under the sup-norm-induced metric, and relate this to the Wasserstein-1 distance between the approximate and true transition kernel, under both discounted cost and average cost criteria. A primary motivation of this analysis is on empirical model estimation, where Wasserstein convergence holds under mild conditions but stronger convergence criterion, such as total variation, may not. We will discuss the application of the results to the disturbance estimation problem, where sample complexity bounds on mismatch loss are given. A further application regarding the continuity of invariant probability measures with respect to transition kernels is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Elements of disinformation theory: cyber engagement via increasing adversary information consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the case where an adversary is conducting a surveillance campaign against a networked control system (NCS), and take the perspective of a defender/control system operator who has successfully isolated the cyber intruder. To better understand the adversary's intentions and to drive up their operating costs, the defender directs the adversary towards a ``honeypot" that emulates a real control system and without actual connections to a physical plant. We propose a strategy for adversary engagement within the ``honey" control system to increase the adversary's costs of information processing. We assume that, based on an understanding of the adversary's control theoretic goals, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) provides the defender knowledge of the adversary's preferences for information acquisition. We use this knowledge to spoof sensor readings to maximize the amount of information the adversary consumes while making it (information theoretically) difficult for the adversary to detect that they are being spoofed. We discuss the case of imperfect versus perfect threat intelligence and perform a numerical comparison.</description>

      <title>Parametric Digital Twins for Preserving Historic Buildings: A Case Study at L\"ofstad Castle in \"Osterg\"otland, Sweden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study showcases the digitalization of L\"ofstad Castle in Sweden to contribute to preserving its heritage values. The castle and its collections are deteriorating due to an inappropriate indoor climate. To address this, thirteen cloud-connected sensor boxes, equipped with 84 sensors, were installed throughout the main building, from the basement to the attic, to continuously monitor various indoor environmental parameters. The collected extensive multi-parametric data form the basis for creating a parametric digital twin of the building. The digital twin and detailed data analytics offer a deeper understanding of indoor climate and guide the adoption of appropriate heating and ventilation strategies. The results revealed the need to address high humidity problems in the basement and on the ground floor, such as installing vapor barriers. Opportunities for adopting energy-efficient heating and ventilation strategies on the upper floors were also highlighted. The digitalization solution and findings are not only applicable to L\"ofstad Castle but also provide valuable guidance for the conservation of other historic buildings facing similar challenges.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptive Safety Filters via Deep Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based approaches for constructing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are increasingly being explored for safety-critical control systems. However, these methods typically require complete retraining when applied to unseen environments, limiting their adaptability. To address this, we propose a self-supervised deep operator learning framework that learns the mapping from environmental parameters to the corresponding CBF, rather than learning the CBF directly. Our approach leverages the residual of a parametric Partial Differential Equation (PDE), where the solution defines a parametric CBF approximating the maximal control invariant set. This framework accommodates complex safety constraints, higher relative degrees, and actuation limits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through numerical experiments on navigation tasks involving dynamic obstacles.</description>

      <title>IoT-Based Water Quality Monitoring System in Philippine Off-Grid Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contaminated and polluted water poses significant threats to human health, necessitating vigilant monitoring of water sources for potential contamination. This paper introduces a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT)-based water quality monitoring system designed to address water quality challenges in rural communities, as demonstrated through a case study conducted in the Philippines. The system consists of two core components. The hardware component of the system, built on Arduino technology and featuring real-time data transmission, focuses on monitoring pH levels, turbidity, and temperature via sensors. The system is equipped to transmit data to a cloud database and send informative messages to mobile numbers, updating users on the status of water supplies. The application component acts as a user interface for accessing and managing data collected by the sensors. The successful deployment of this Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) system not only helps community leaders and health workers monitor water sources but also underscores its potential to empower communities in safeguarding their water sources, thereby contributing to the advancement of clean and safe water access.</description>

      <title>Islanding Detection for Active Distribution Networks Using WaveNet+UNet Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an AI-based scheme for islanding detection in active distribution networks. By reviewing existing studies, it is clear that there are several gaps in the field to ensure reliable islanding detection, including (i) model complexity and stability concerns, (ii) limited accuracy under noisy conditions, and (iii) limited applicability to systems with different types of resources. Accordingly, this paper proposes a WaveNet classifier reinforced by a denoising U-Net model to address these shortcomings. The proposed scheme has a simple structure due to the use of 1D convolutional layers and incorporates residual connections that significantly enhance the model's generalization. Additionally, the proposed scheme is robust against noisy conditions by incorporating a denoising U-Net model. Furthermore, the model is sufficiently fast using a sliding window time series of 10 milliseconds for detection. Utilizing positive/negative/zero sequence components of voltages, superimposed waveforms, and the rate of change of frequency provides the necessary features to precisely detect the islanding condition. In order to assess the effectiveness of the suggested scheme, over 3k islanding/non-islanding cases were tested, considering different load active/reactive powers values, load switching transients, capacitor bank switching, fault conditions in the main grid, different load quality factors, signal-to-noise ratio levels, and both types of conventional and inverter-based sources.</description>

      <title>Enhancing In-vehicle Multiple Object Tracking Systems with Embeddable Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cognitive function of tracking multiple objects, needed in autonomous mobile vehicles, comprises object detection and their temporal association. While great progress owing to machine learning has been recently seen for elaborating the similarity matrix between the objects that have been recognized and the objects detected in a current video frame, less for the assignment problem that finally determines the temporal association, which is a combinatorial optimization problem. Here we show an in-vehicle multiple object tracking system with a flexible assignment function for tracking through multiple long-term occlusion events. To solve the flexible assignment problem formulated as a nondeterministic polynomial time-hard problem, the system relies on an embeddable Ising machine based on a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation. Using a vehicle-mountable computing platform, we demonstrate a realtime system-wide throughput (23 frames per second on average) with the enhanced functionality.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Solar Cell Recognition for Optical Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical wireless power transfer (OWPT) is a technology that wirelessly transmit light energy from an optical transmitter to an optical receiver, usually a solar cell. In order to achieve the highest transmission efficiency, the solar cell receiver should be accurately aligned with the optical transmitter. Hitherto, only a few works have been existed for solar cell recognition in presence of complex backgrounds. In this paper, we employ a deep learning approach based on Yolov5-Lite for the solar cell recognition purpose, due to its lightweight, fast and easy to deploy on hardware characteristics. Our tests show a high accuracy of the employed deep learning model with the highest F1 score of 91% and mAP of 94.8%. Therefore, this deep learning model is highly promising for use in OWPT systems to precisely align optical transmitters and solar cell receivers.</description>

      <title>Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration in Industry 5.0</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14153v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration (WHMC) represents a critical advancement for Industry 5.0, enabling seamless interaction between humans and machines across geographically distributed systems. As the WHMC systems become increasingly important for achieving complex collaborative control tasks, ensuring their stability is essential for practical deployment and long-term operation. Stability analysis certifies how the closed-loop system will behave under model randomness, which is essential for systems operating with wireless communications. However, the fundamental stability analysis of the WHMC systems remains an unexplored challenge due to the intricate interplay between the stochastic nature of wireless communications, dynamic human operations, and the inherent complexities of control system dynamics. This paper establishes a fundamental WHMC model incorporating dual wireless loops for machine and human control. Our framework accounts for practical factors such as short-packet transmissions, fading channels, and advanced HARQ schemes. We model human control lag as a Markov process, which is crucial for capturing the stochastic nature of human interactions. Building on this model, we propose a stochastic cycle-cost-based approach to derive a stability condition for the WHMC system, expressed in terms of wireless channel statistics, human dynamics, and control parameters. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment, where we developed and tested a novel wireless collaborative cart-pole control system. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a robust framework for future research on WHMC systems in more complex environments.</description>

      <title>Performance bounds for multi-vehicle networks with local integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of coordinating a collection of $n$th-order integrator systems. The coordination is achieved through the novel serial-consensus design, which can be seen as a method for achieving a stable closed-loop while only using local relative measurements. Earlier work has shown that second-order serial consensus can stabilize a collection of double integrators with scalable performance conditions, independent of the number of agents and topology. In this paper, we generalize these performance results to an arbitrary order $n\geq 1$. The derived performance bound depends on the condition number, measured in the vector-induced maximum matrix norm, of a general diagonalizing matrix. We provide an exact characterization of how a minimal condition number can be achieved. Third-order serial consensus is illustrated through a case study of PI-controlled vehicular formation, where the added integrators are used to mitigate the effect of unmeasured load disturbances. The theoretical results are illustrated through examples.</description>

      <title>Reimagining partial thickness keratoplasty: An eye mountable robot for autonomous big bubble needle insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous surgical robots have demonstrated significant potential to standardize surgical outcomes, driving innovations that enhance safety and consistency regardless of individual surgeon experience. Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), a partial thickness corneal transplant surgery aimed at replacing the anterior part of cornea above Descemet membrane (DM), would greatly benefit from an autonomous surgical approach as it highly relies on surgeon skill with high perforation rates. In this study, we proposed a novel autonomous surgical robotic system (AUTO-DALK) based on a customized neural network capable of precise needle control and consistent big bubble demarcation on cadaver and live rabbit models. We demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-based image-guided vertical drilling approach for big bubble generation, in contrast to the conventional horizontal needle approach. Our system integrates an optical coherence tomography (OCT) fiber optic distal sensor into the eye-mountable micro robotic system, which automatically segments OCT M-mode depth signals to identify corneal layers using a custom deep learning algorithm. It enables the robot to autonomously guide the needle to targeted tissue layers via a depth-controlled feedback loop. We compared autonomous needle insertion performance and resulting pneumo-dissection using AUTO-DALK against 1) freehand insertion, 2) OCT sensor guided manual insertion, and 3) teleoperated robotic insertion, reporting significant improvements in insertion depth, pneumo-dissection depth, task completion time, and big bubble formation. Ex vivo and in vivo results indicate that the AI-driven, AUTO-DALK system, is a promising solution to standardize pneumo-dissection outcomes for partial thickness keratoplasty.</description>

      <title>On the Solution Uniqueness of Data-Driven Modeling of Flexible Loads (with Supplementary Material)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter first explores the solution uniqueness of the data-driven modeling of price-responsive flexible loads (PFL). The PFL on the demand side is critical in modern power systems. An accurate PFL model is fundamental for system operations. However, whether the PFL model can be uniquely and correctly identified from operational data remains unclear. To address this, we analyze the structural and practical identifiability of the PFL model, deriving the dataset condition that guarantees the solution uniqueness. Besides, we point out the practical implications of the results. Numerical tests validate this work.</description>

      <title>On the Regret of Recursive Methods for Discrete-Time Adaptive Control with Matched Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-time adaptive controllers for systems with a matched uncertainty often comprise an online parameter estimator and a corresponding parameterized controller to cancel the uncertainty. However, such methods are often impossible to implement directly, as they depend on an unobserved estimation error. We consider the equivalent discrete-time setting with a causal information structure, and propose a novel, online proximal point method-based adaptive controller, that under a sufficient excitation (SE) condition is asymptotically stable and achieves finite regret, scaling only with the time required to fulfill the SE. We show the same also for the widely-used recursive least squares with exponential forgetting controller under a stronger persistence of excitation condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the experiences gained from designing, deploying and maintaining low-power wireless sensor networks in three geothermally active remote locations in Iceland. The network was deployed to assist researchers in collecting soil temperature data which would help them investigate the impact of global warming on (sub)Arctic climate and subsequent carbon release. Functional networks with more than 50 sensor nodes from three sites with no direct access to power and the Internet have been providing researchers insight into the warming impacts since 2021. The network employs low-power primary cell-powered wireless sensor nodes equipped with DASH7 communication protocol and solar-powered DASH7-cellular gateways, providing real-time data and remote access to sensors and devices deployed in the field. We present a detailed discussion of different network components, their architecture, and the network's overall performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Learning Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Learning Model Predictive Control is a novel data-driven control scheme which improves a linear system's closed-loop performance with respect to several convex control objectives over iterations of a repeated task. At each task iteration, collected system data is used to construct terminal components of a Model Predictive Controller. The formulation presented in this paper ensures that closed-loop control performance improves between successive iterations with respect to each objective. We provide proofs of recursive feasibility and performance improvement, and show that the converged policy is Pareto optimal. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization with Finite Bit Adaptive Quantization for Efficient Communication and Precision Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In realistic distributed optimization scenarios, individual nodes possess only partial information and communicate over bandwidth constrained channels. For this reason, the development of efficient distributed algorithms is essential. In our paper we addresses the challenge of unconstrained distributed optimization. In our scenario each node's local function exhibits strong convexity with Lipschitz continuous gradients. The exchange of information between nodes occurs through $3$-bit bandwidth-limited channels (i.e., nodes exchange messages represented by a only $3$-bits). Our proposed algorithm respects the network's bandwidth constraints by leveraging zoom-in and zoom-out operations to adjust quantizer parameters dynamically. We show that during our algorithm's operation nodes are able to converge to the exact optimal solution. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm achieves a linear convergence rate to the optimal solution. We conclude the paper with simulations that highlight our algorithm's unique characteristics.</description>

      <title>Simple controller design to achieve iso-damping robustness: Non-iterative data-driven approach based on fractional-order reference model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a simple controller design approach to achieve a class of robustness, the so-called iso-damping property. The proposed approach can be executed using only one-shot input/output data. An accurate mathematical model of a controlled plant is not required. The model-reference control problem is defined to achieve the desired closed-loop specifications, including the iso-damping, and the reference model is designed on the basis of fractional-order calculus. The optimization problem for the model-reference control is formulated using the one-shot input/output data while considering the bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output. The iso-damping robust controller is obtained by solving the optimization problem. The representative advantages of the proposed approach over the conventional methods are the simplicity, practicality, and reliability from the viewpoint of the unnecessity of the plant model and explicit consideration of the BIBO stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Augmented Intelligence in Smart Intersections: Local Digital Twins-Assisted Hybrid Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle-road collaboration is a promising approach for enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving by extending the intelligence of onboard systems to smart roadside infrastructures. The introduction of digital twins (DTs), particularly local DTs (LDTs) at the edge, in smart mobility presents a new embodiment of augmented intelligence, which could enhance information exchange and extract human driving expertise to improve onboard intelligence. This paper presents a novel LDT-assisted hybrid autonomous driving system for improving safety and efficiency in traffic intersections. By leveraging roadside units (RSUs) equipped with sensory and computing capabilities, the proposed system continuously monitors traffic, extracts human driving knowledge, and generates intersection-specific local driving agents through an offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework. When connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) pass through RSU-equipped intersections, RSUs can provide local agents to support safe and efficient driving in local areas. Meanwhile, they provide real-time cooperative perception (CP) to broaden onboard sensory horizons. The proposed LDT-assisted hybrid system is implemented with state-of-the-art products, e.g., CAVs and RSUs, and technologies, e.g., millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulations and proof-of-concept (PoC) tests validate system performance from two standpoints: (i) The peak latency for CP and local agent downloading are 8.51 ms and 146 ms, respectively, aligning with 3GPP requirements for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and model transfer use cases. Moreover, (ii) local driving agents can improve safety measures by 10% and reduce travel time by 15% compared with conventional onboard systems. The implemented prototype also demonstrates reliable real-time performance, fulfilling the targets of the proposed system design.</description>

      <title>Learning a Stable, Safe, Distributed Feedback Controller for a Heterogeneous Platoon of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platooning of autonomous vehicles has the potential to increase safety and fuel efficiency on highways. The goal of platooning is to have each vehicle drive at a specified speed (set by the leader) while maintaining a safe distance from its neighbors. Many prior works have analyzed various controllers for platooning, most commonly linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for learning a stable, safe, distributed controller for a heterogeneous platoon. Our algorithm relies on recent developments in learning neural network stability certificates. We train a controller for autonomous platooning in simulation and evaluate its performance on hardware with a platoon of four F1Tenth vehicles. We then perform further analysis in simulation with a platoon of 100 vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the practicality of the algorithm and the learned controller by comparing the performance of the neural network controller to linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers.</description>

      <title>Context-aware Mamba-based Reinforcement Learning for social robot navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social robot navigation (SRN) is a relevant problem that involves navigating a pedestrian-rich environment in a socially acceptable manner. It is an essential part of making social robots effective in pedestrian-rich settings. The use cases of such robots could vary from companion robots to warehouse robots to autonomous wheelchairs. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has been increasingly used in research on social robot navigation. Our work introduces CAMRL (Context-Aware Mamba-based Reinforcement Learning). Mamba is a new deep learning-based State Space Model (SSM) that has achieved results comparable to transformers in sequencing tasks. CAMRL uses Mamba to determine the robot's next action, which maximizes the value of the next state predicted by the neural network, enabling the robot to navigate effectively based on the rewards assigned. We evaluate CAMRL alongside existing solutions (CADRL, LSTM-RL, SARL) using a rigorous testing dataset which involves a variety of densities and environment behaviors based on ORCA and SFM, thus, demonstrating that CAMRL achieves higher success rates, minimizes collisions, and maintains safer distances from pedestrians. This work introduces a new SRN planner, showcasing the potential for deep-state space models for robot navigation.</description>
