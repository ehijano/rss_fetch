      <title>GPTs Window Shopping: An analysis of the Landscape of Custom ChatGPT Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT initiated a wave of technical iterations in the space of Large Language Models (LLMs) by demonstrating the capability and disruptive power of LLMs. OpenAI has prompted large organizations to respond with their own advancements and models to push the LLM performance envelope. OpenAI has prompted large organizations to respond with their own advancements and models to push the LLM performance envelope. OpenAI's success in spotlighting AI can be partially attributed to decreased barriers to entry, enabling any individual with an internet-enabled device to interact with LLMs. What was previously relegated to a few researchers and developers with necessary computing resources is now available to all. A desire to customize LLMs to better accommodate individual needs prompted OpenAI's creation of the GPT Store, a central platform where users can create and share custom GPT models. Customization comes in the form of prompt-tuning, analysis of reference resources, browsing, and external API interactions, alongside a promise of revenue sharing for created custom GPTs. In this work, we peer into the window of the GPT Store and measure its impact. Our analysis constitutes a large-scale overview of the store exploring community perception, GPT details, and the GPT authors, in addition to a deep-dive into a 3rd party storefront indexing user-submitted GPTs, exploring if creators seek to monetize their creations in the absence of OpenAI's revenue sharing.</description>

      <title>CACL: Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Social Media Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media bot detection is increasingly crucial with the rise of social media platforms. Existing methods predominantly construct social networks as graph and utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) for bot detection. However, most of these methods focus on how to improve the performance of GNNs while neglecting the community structure within social networks. Moreover, GNNs based methods still face problems such as poor model generalization due to the relatively small scale of the dataset and over-smoothness caused by information propagation mechanism. To address these problems, we propose a Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning framework (CACL), which constructs social network as heterogeneous graph with multiple node types and edge types, and then utilizes community-aware module to dynamically mine both hard positive samples and hard negative samples for supervised graph contrastive learning with adaptive graph enhancement algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework addresses the previously mentioned challenges and outperforms competitive baselines on three social media bot benchmarks.</description>

      <title>COMET: NFT Price Prediction with Wallet Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the non-fungible token (NFT) market flourishes, price prediction emerges as a pivotal direction for investors gaining valuable insight to maximize returns. However, existing works suffer from a lack of practical definitions and standardized evaluations, limiting their practical application. Moreover, the influence of users' multi-behaviour transactions that are publicly accessible on NFT price is still not explored and exhibits challenges. In this paper, we address these gaps by presenting a practical and hierarchical problem definition. This approach unifies both collection-level and token-level task and evaluation methods, which cater to varied practical requirements of investors. To further understand the impact of user behaviours on the variation of NFT price, we propose a general wallet profiling framework and develop a COmmunity enhanced Multi-bEhavior Transaction graph model, named COMET. COMET profiles wallets with a comprehensive view and considers the impact of diverse relations and interactions within the NFT ecosystem on NFT price variations, thereby improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments conducted in our deployed system demonstrate the superiority of COMET, underscoring its potential in the insight toolkit for NFT investors.</description>

      <title>Modeling Supply Chain Interaction and Disruption: Insights from Real-world Data and Complex Adaptive System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving automotive industry, Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) are playing an increasingly crucial role in enhancing vehicle intelligence, connectivity, and safety features. For enterprises whose business encompasses automotive SoCs, the sustained and stable provision and receipt of SoC relevant goods or services are essential. Considering the imperative for a resilient and adaptable supply network, enterprises are concentrating their efforts on formulating strategies to address risks stemming from supply chain disruptions caused by technological obsolescence, natural disasters, and geopolitical tensions. This study presents an open supply knowledge extraction and complement approach and build a supply chain network of automotive SoC enterprises in China, which incorporates cross-domain named entity recognition under limited information, fuzzy matching of firm entities, and supply relation inferring based on knowledge graph. Subsequently, we exhibit the degree and registered capital distribution across firms, and analyze the correlations between centrality metrics in the supply chain network. Finally, based on recovery capacity and risk transfer, two interaction disruption models (IDMs) are developed to elucidate the adaptive behaviors and effect of network disruptions under various business and attack strategies. This research not only aids in exploring the complexities of Chinese automotive SoC supply chain but also enriches our understanding of the dynamics of firm behavior in this crucial industry sector.</description>

      <title>Node Feature Augmentation Vitaminizes Network Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Analysis and implementation of nanotargeting on LinkedIn based on publicly available non-PII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The literature has shown that combining a few non-Personal Identifiable Information (non-PII) is enough to make a user unique in a dataset including millions of users. This work demonstrates that a combination of a few non-PII items can be activated to nanotarget users. We demonstrate that the combination of the location and {5} rare ({13} random) skills in a LinkedIn profile is enough to become unique in a user base of {$\sim$970M} users with a probability of 75\%. The novelty is that these attributes are publicly accessible to anyone registered on LinkedIn and can be activated through advertising campaigns. We ran an experiment configuring ad campaigns using the location and skills of three of the paper's authors, demonstrating how all the ads using $\geq13$ skills were delivered exclusively to the targeted user. We reported this vulnerability to LinkedIn, which initially ignored the problem, but fixed it as of November 2023.%This nanotargeting may expose LinkedIn users to privacy and security risks such as malvertising or manipulation.</description>

      <title>Information Cascade Prediction under Public Emergencies: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of the era of big data, massive information, expert experience, and high-accuracy models bring great opportunities to the information cascade prediction of public emergencies. However, the involvement of specialist knowledge from various disciplines has resulted in a primarily application-specific focus (e.g., earthquakes, floods, infectious diseases) for information cascade prediction of public emergencies. The lack of a unified prediction framework poses a challenge for classifying intersectional prediction methods across different application fields. This survey paper offers a systematic classification and summary of information cascade modeling, prediction, and application. We aim to help researchers identify cutting-edge research and comprehend models and methods of information cascade prediction under public emergencies. By summarizing open issues and outlining future directions in this field, this paper has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers conducting further studies on predicting information cascades.</description>

      <title>On the initial value of PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.00004v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Google employs PageRank to rank web pages, determining the order in which search results are presented to users based on their queries. PageRank is primarily utilized for directed networks, although there are instances where it is also applied to undirected networks. In this paper, we have applied PageRank to undirected networks, showing that a vertex's PageRank relies on its initial value, often referred to as an intrinsic, non-network contribution. We have analytically proved that when the initial value of vertices is either proportional to their degrees or set to zero, the PageRank values of the vertices become directly proportional to their degrees. Simulated and empirical data are employed to bolster our research findings. Additionally, we have investigated the impact of initial values on PageRank localization.</description>

      <title>Incentive Design for Eco-driving in Urban Transportation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eco-driving emerges as a cost-effective and efficient strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in urban transportation networks. Acknowledging the persuasive influence of incentives in shaping driver behavior, this paper presents the `eco-planner,' a digital platform devised to promote eco-driving practices in urban transportation. At the outset of their trips, users provide the platform with their trip details and travel time preferences, enabling the eco-planner to formulate personalized eco-driving recommendations and corresponding incentives, while adhering to its budgetary constraints. Upon trip completion, incentives are transferred to users who comply with the recommendations and effectively reduce their emissions. By comparing our proposed incentive mechanism with a baseline scheme that offers uniform incentives to all users, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior emission reductions and increased user compliance with a smaller budget.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Stance Labeling: User-Hashtag Heuristics with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high volume and rapid evolution of content on social media present major challenges for studying the stance of social media users. In this work, we develop a two stage stance labeling method that utilizes the user-hashtag bipartite graph and the user-user interaction graph. In the first stage, a simple and efficient heuristic for stance labeling uses the user-hashtag bipartite graph to iteratively update the stance association of user and hashtag nodes via a label propagation mechanism. This set of soft labels is then integrated with the user-user interaction graph to train a graph neural network (GNN) model using semi-supervised learning. We evaluate this method on two large-scale datasets containing tweets related to climate change from June 2021 to June 2022 and gun control from January 2022 to January 2023. Our experiments demonstrate that enriching text-based embeddings of users with network information from the user interaction graph using our semi-supervised GNN method outperforms both classifiers trained on user textual embeddings and zero-shot classification using LLMs such as GPT4. We discuss the need for integrating nuanced understanding from social science with the scalability of computational methods to better understand how polarization on social media occurs for divisive issues such as climate change and gun control.</description>
