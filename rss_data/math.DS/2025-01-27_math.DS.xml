      <title>Horocycles in hyperbolic 3-manifolds with round Sierpi\'nski limit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let M be a geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifold whose limit set is a round Sierpi\'nski carpet, i.e. M is geometrically finite and acylindrical with a compact, totally geodesic convex core boundary. In this paper, we classify orbit closures of the 1-dimensional horocycle flow on the frame bundle of M. As a result, the closure of a horocycle in M is a properly immersed submanifold. This extends the work of McMullen-Mohammadi-Oh where M is further assumed to be convex cocompact.</description>

      <title>Social dynamics can delay or prevent climate tipping points by speeding the adoption of climate change mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social behaviour models are increasingly integrated into climate change studies, and the significance of climate tipping points for `runaway' climate change is well recognised. However, there has been insufficient focus on tipping points in social-climate dynamics. We developed a coupled social-climate model consisting of an Earth system model and a social behaviour model, both with tipping elements. The social model explores opinion formation by analysing social learning rates, the net cost of mitigation, and the strength of social norms. Our results indicate that the net cost of mitigation and social norms have minimal impact on tipping points when social norms are weak. As social norms strengthen, the climate tipping point can trigger a tipping element in the social model. However, faster social learning can delay or prevent the climate tipping point: sufficiently fast social learning means growing climate change mitigation can outpace the oncoming climate tipping point, despite social-climate feedback. By comparing high- and low-risk scenarios, we demonstrated high-risk scenarios increase the likelihood of tipping points. We also illustrate the role of a critical temperature anomaly in triggering tipping points. In conclusion, understanding social behaviour dynamics is vital for predicting climate tipping points and mitigating their impacts.</description>

      <title>A brief survey of Benford's Law in dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a brief overview on a range of basic dynamical systems that conform to the logarithmic distribution of significant digits known as Benford's law. As presented here, most theorems are special cases of known, more general results about dynamical systems whose orbits or trajectories follow this logarithmic law, in one way or another. These results span a wide variety of systems: autonomous and non-autonomous; discrete- and continuous-time; one- and multi-dimensional; deterministic and stochastic. Illustrative examples include familiar systems such as the tent map, Newton's root-finding algorithm, and geometric Brownian motion. The treatise is informal, with the goal of showcasing to the specialists the generality and universal appeal of Benford's law throughout the mathematical field of dynamical systems. References to complete proofs are provided for each known result, while one new theorem is presented in some detail.</description>

      <title>Planar Kolmogorov systems with infinitely many singular points at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the global dynamics of the five-parameter family of planar Kolmogorov systems \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
  \dot{y}&amp;=y \left( b_0+ b_1 y z + b_2 y + b_3 z\right),
  \dot{z}&amp;=z\left( c_0 + b_1 y z + b_2 y + b_3 z\right),
  \end{split} \end{equation*} which is obtained from the Lotka-Volterra systems of dimension three. These systems have infinitely many singular points at inifnity. We give the topological classification of their phase portraits in the Poincar\'e disc, so we can describe the dynamics of these systems near infinity. We prove that these systems have 13 topologically distinct global phase portraits.</description>

      <title>The automorphism group of a strongly irreducible subshift on a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the automorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ of a non-trivial strongly irreducible subshift $X$ on an arbitrary infinite group $G$ and generalize classical results of Ryan, Kim and Roush.
  We generalize Ryan's theorem by showing that the center of $\operatorname{Aux}(X)$ is generated by shifts by elements of the center of $G$ modded out by the kernel of the shift action. Thus up to isomorphism it coincides with $G$ modded out by the kernel of the shift action.
  We generalize Kim and Roush's theorem by showing that if the free group $F_k$ of rank $k\geq 1$ embeds into $G$, then the automorphism group of any full $F_k$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$. Moreover, if $X$ satisfies the strong topological Markov property (and, in particular, if $X$ is an SFT), then the automorphism group of any full $\mathbb{Z}$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ provided $G$ is not locally finite, and the automorphism group of any full $F_k$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ if $G$ is nonamenable. These results rely on a new marker lemma which is valid for any nonempty strongly irreducible subshift on an infinite group.
  We remark that the classical theorem of Ryan applies to a full $\mathbb{Z}$-shift, while the result of Kim and Roush applies to mixing $\mathbb{Z}$-SFTs. Thus in the case $G=\mathbb{Z}$, our results improve the current ones.</description>

      <title>Ergodic theorems for set maps under weak forms of additivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate various relaxations of additivity for set maps into Banach spaces in the context of representations of amenable groups. Specifically, we establish conditions under which asymptotically additive and almost additive set maps are equivalent. For Banach lattices, we further show that these notions are related to a third weak form of additivity adapted to the order structure of the space. By utilizing these equivalences and reducing non-additive settings to the additive one by finding suitable additive realizations, we derive new non-additive ergodic theorems for amenable group representations into Banach spaces and streamline proofs of existing results in certain cases.</description>

      <title>The silent threat of methane to ecosystems: Insights from mechanistic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past century, atmospheric methane levels have nearly doubled, posing a significant threat to ecosystems. Despite this, studies on its direct impact on species interactions are lacking. Although bioaccumulation theory explains the effects of contaminants in trophic levels, it is inadequate for gaseous pollutants such as methane. This study aims to bridge the gap by developing a methane-population-detritus model to investigate ecological impacts in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Our findings show that low methane concentrations can enhance species growth, while moderate accumulation may induce sub-lethal effects over time. Elevated methane levels, however, lead to ecosystem collapse. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to the gas increases the sensitivity of species towards rising temperatures. Multiscale analysis reveals that rapid methane accumulation leads to long transients near the extinction states. We argue that high emission rates can push the system towards a critical threshold, where the ecosystem shifts to an alternative stable state characterized by elevated methane concentrations. This work highlights the urgent need for a better understanding of the fatal role of methane in ecosystems for developing strategies to mitigate its effects amid climate change.</description>

Abstract: We study connection points on the double regular $n$-gon translation surface, for $n \geq 7$ odd and its staircase model. For $n \neq 9$, we provide a large family of points with coordinates in the trace field that are not connection points. This family includes the central points, and for $n=7$ we conjecture that all the remaining points are connection points. Further, in the case where $n \geq 7$ is a prime number, we provide a constructive proof by exhibiting an explicit separatrix passing through a central point that does not extend to a saddle connection.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square-shaped computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes with the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitly defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

      <title>Weighted Shift operators on spaces of analytic functions over an annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article aims to initiate a study of the forward weighted shift operator, denoted by $F_w$, defined on the Banach spaces $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ and $c_{0,a,b}(\mathtt{A})$. Here, $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ and $c_{0,a.b}(\mathtt{A})$, respectively, are the Banach spaces of analytic functions on a suitable annulus $\mathtt{A}$ in the complex plane, having a normalized Schauder basis of the form $\{(a_n+b_nz)z^n, ~~n\in \mathbb{Z}\}$, which is equivalent to the standard basis in $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$ and $c_0(\mathbb{Z})$. We first obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for $F_w$ to be bounded, and show that, under certain conditions on $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$, the operator $F_w$ is similar to a compact perturbation of a bilateral weighted shift on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$. This also allows us to obtain the essential spectrum of $F_w$. Further, we study when $F_w$ and its adjoint $F_w^*$ are hypercyclic, supercyclic, and chaotic, and provide a class of chaotic operators that are compact perturbations of weighted shifts on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$. Finally, it is proved that the adjoint of a shift on the dual of $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ can have non-trivial periodic vectors, without being even hypercyclic. Also, the zero-one law of orbital limit points fails for $F_w^*$.</description>
