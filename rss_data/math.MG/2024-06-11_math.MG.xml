      <title>On Extremal Problems Associated with Random Chords on a Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Karamata, we consider an extremization problem associated with the probability of intersecting two random chords inside a circle of radius $r, \, r \in (0,1]$, where the endpoints of the chords are drawn according to a given probability distribution on $\mathbb{S}^1$.
  We show that, for $r=1,$ the problem is degenerated in the sense that any continuous measure is an extremiser, and that, for $r$ sufficiently close to $1,$ the desired maximal value is strictly below the one for $r=1$ by a polynomial factor in $1-r.$ Finally, we prove, by considering the auxiliary problem of drawing a single random chord, that the desired maximum is $1/4$ for $r \in (0,1/2).$ Connections with other variational problems and energy minimization problems are also presented.</description>

      <title>Entropy, slicing problem and functional Mahler's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, Bo'az Klartag showed that, given a convex body with minimal volume product, its isotropic constant is related to its volume product. As a consequence, he obtained that a strong version of the slicing conjecture implies Mahler's conjecture. In this work, we extend these geometrical results to the realm of log-concave functions. In this regard, the functional analogues of the projective perturbations of the body are the log-Laplace perturbations of the function. The differentiation along these transformations is simplified thanks to the known properties of the log-Laplace transform. Moreover, we show that achieving such an analogous result requires the consideration of the suitable version of the isotropic constant, notably the one incorporating the entropy. Finally, an investigation into the equivalences between the functional and geometrical strong forms of the slicing conjecture is provided.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for sphere packing in arbitrary norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in any $d$-dimensional real normed space, unit balls can be packed with density at least \[\frac{(1-o(1))d\log d}{2^{d+1}},\] improving a result of Schmidt from 1958 by a logarithmic factor and generalizing the recent result of Campos, Jenssen, Michelen, and Sahasrabudhe in the $\ell_2$ norm. Our main tools are the graph-theoretic result used in the $\ell_2$ construction and recent progress on the Bourgain slicing problem.</description>

      <title>Interpolating between Hausdorff and box dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hausdorff and box dimension are two familiar notions of fractal dimension. Box dimension can be larger than Hausdorff dimension, because in the definition of box dimension, all sets in the cover have the same diameter, but for Hausdorff dimension there is no such restriction. This thesis focuses on a family of dimensions parameterised by $\theta \in (0,1)$, called the intermediate dimensions, which are defined by requiring that $\mbox{diam}(U) \leq (\mbox{diam}(V))^{\theta}$ for all sets $U,V$ in the cover.
  We begin by generalising the intermediate dimensions to allow for greater refinement in how the relative sizes of the covering sets are restricted. These new dimensions can recover the interpolation between Hausdorff and box dimension for compact sets whose intermediate dimensions do not tend to the Hausdorff dimension as $\theta \to 0$. We also use a Moran set construction to prove a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of Dini derivatives, for a given function to be realised as the intermediate dimensions of a set.
  We proceed to prove that the intermediate dimensions of limit sets of infinite conformal iterated function systems are given by the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and the intermediate dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. This applies to sets defined using continued fraction expansions, and has applications to dimensions of projections, fractional Brownian images, and general H\"older images.
  Finally, we determine a formula for the intermediate dimensions of all self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets. The functions display features not witnessed in previous examples, such as having countably many phase transitions. We deduce that two carpets have equal intermediate dimensions if and only if the multifractal spectra of the corresponding uniform Bernoulli measures coincide.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature bounds and rigidity for non-smooth Riemannian and semi-Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits %incorporates both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness on average of large isoperimetric sets in noncompact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M^n,g)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold which is not isometric to $\mathbb{R}^n$, has nonnegative Ricci curvature, Euclidean volume growth, and quadratic Riemann curvature decay. We prove that there is a set $\mathcal{G}\subset (0,\infty)$ with density $1$ at infinity such that for every $V\in \mathcal{G}$ there is a unique isoperimetric set of volume $V$ in $M$, and its boundary is strictly volume preserving stable.
  The latter result cannot be improved to uniqueness or strict stability for every large volume. Indeed, we construct a complete Riemannian surface that satisfies the previous assumptions, and with the following property: there are arbitrarily large and diverging intervals $I_n\subset (0,\infty)$ such that isoperimetric sets with volumes $V\in I_n$ exist, but they are neither unique nor they have strictly volume preserving stable boundaries.
  The proof relies on a set of new ideas, as the present setting goes beyond the range of applicability of the methods based on the implicit function theorem, and no symmetry is assumed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lipschitz numbers, fine differentiability, and quasiconformal mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized version of the local Lipschitz number $\textrm{lip}\,u$, and show that it can be used to characterize Sobolev functions $u\in W_{\textrm{loc}}^{1,p}(\mathbb R^n)$, $1\le p\le \infty$, as well as functions of bounded variation. This concept turns out to be fruitful for studying, and for establishing new connections between, a wide range of topics including fine differentiability, Rademacher's theorem, Federer's characterization of sets of finite perimeter, regularity of maximal functions, quasiconformal mappings, Alberti's rank one theorem, as well as generalizations to metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Bakry-\`Emery, Hardy, and Spectral Gap Estimates on Manifolds with Conical Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spectral properties and geometric functional inequalities on Riemannian manifolds of dimension $\ge3$ with (finite or countably many) conical singularities $\{z_i\}_{i\in\mathfrak I}$ in the neighborhood of which the largest lower bound for the Ricci curvature is \begin{equation}\label{d2} k(x)\simeq K_i-\frac{s_i}{d^2(z_i,x)}. \end{equation} Thus none of the existing Bakry-\'Emery inequalities or curvature-dimension conditions apply. In particular, $k$ does not belong to the Kato (or (extended Kato) class, and $(M,g)$ is not tamed. Manifolds with such a singular Ricci bound appear quite naturally., e.g. as cones over spheres of radius $&gt;1$
  For such manifolds with conical singularities we will prove
  * a version of the Bakry-\'Emery inequality
  * a novel Hardy inequality
  * a spectral gap estimate.</description>
