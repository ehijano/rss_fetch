      <title>Conic sections in ferroelectric nematics: experiments and mathematical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain structure of a fluid ferroelectric nematic is dramatically different from the domain structure of solid ferroelectrics since it is not restricted by rectilinear crystallographic axes and planar surface facets. We demonstrate that thin films of a ferroelectric nematic seeded by colloidal inclusions produce domain walls in the shape of conics such as a parabola. These conics reduce the bound charge within the domains and at the domain walls. An adequate description of the domain structures requires one to analyze the electrostatic energy, which is a challenging task. Instead, we demonstrate that a good approximation to the experimentally observed polydomain textures is obtained when the divergence of spontaneous polarization - which causes the bound charge is heavily penalized by assuming that the elastic constant of splay in the Oseen-Frank energy is much larger than those for twist and bend. The model takes advantage of the fact that the polarization vector is essentially parallel to the nematic director throughout the sample.</description>

      <title>Nano-confinement induced nucleation of ice-VII at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrogen bond (HB) network of water under confinement has been predicted to have distinct structures from that of bulk water. However, direct measurement of the structure has not been achieved. Here, we present experimental evidence of confinement-induced ice formation in water. We directly probe the HB network of a water nano-meniscus formed and confined between a mica substrate and a precisely-controlled-plasmonically active silver tip. By employing tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), we observe a novel double donor-double acceptor (DDAA) peak that emerges in the OH stretching band of water molecules at room temperature and at sub-nanometer confinement. This Raman peak indicates the presence of a solid phase of water, namely ice-VII with the body-centered cubic (bcc) unit. Interestingly, we observe a structural transition from bcc DDAA (ice-VII) to tetrahedral DDAA as the confinement is weakened. Moreover, by identifying the spatial distribution of the HB network, we find that the bcc DDAA network of ice-VII is predominantly present within the interior of the confined water, rather than at air/water or at solid/water interfaces. This suggest the possibility that the appearance of ice-VII in the strongly confined space could be a general characteristic of water under extreme confinement.</description>

      <title>Gas-induced bulging in pouch-cell batteries: a mechanical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the long timescale of many charge/discharge cycles, gas formation can result in large bulging deformations of a Lithium-ion pouch cell, which is a key failure mechanism in batteries. Guided by recent experimental X-ray tomography data of a bulging cell, we propose a homogenised mechanical model to predict the shape of the deformation and the stress distribution analytically. Our model can be included in battery simulation models to capture the effects of mechanical degradation. Furthermore, with knowledge of the bending stiffness of the cathode electrodes and current collectors, and by fitting our model to experimental data, we can predict the internal pressure and the amount of gas in the battery, thus assisting in monitoring the state of health (SOH) of the cell without breaking the sealed case.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Hard and Soft Nanoparticle-Protein Corona with Multilayer Adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) in contact with biological fluid adsorb biomolecules into a corona. This corona comprises proteins that strongly bind to the NP (hard corona) and loosely bound proteins (soft corona) that dynamically exchange with the surrounding solution. While the kinetics of hard corona formation is relatively well understood, thanks to experiments and robust simulation models, the experimental characterization and simulation of the soft corona present a more significant challenge. Here, we review the current state of the art in soft corona characterization and introduce a novel open-source computational model to simulate its dynamic behavior, for which we provide the documentation. We focus on the case of transferrin (Tf) interacting with polystyrene NPs as an illustrative example, demonstrating how this model captures the complexities of the soft corona and offers deeper insights into its structure and behavior. We show that the soft corona is dominated by a glassy evolution that we relate to crowding effects. This work advances our understanding of the soft corona, bridging experimental limitations with improved simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Topological comparison of flexible and semiflexible chains in polymer melts with $\theta$-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central paradigm of polymer physics states that chains in melts behave like random walks as intra- and interchain interactions effectively cancel each other out. Likewise, $\theta$-chains, i.e., chains at the transition from a swollen coil to a globular phase, are also thought to behave like ideal chains, as attractive forces are counterbalanced by repulsive entropic contributions. While the simple mapping to an equivalent Kuhn chain works rather well in most scenarios with corrections to scaling, random walks do not accurately capture the topology and knots particularly for flexible chains. In this paper, we demonstrate with Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations that chains in polymer melts and $\theta$-chains not only agree on a structural level for a range of stiffnesses, but also topologically. They exhibit similar knotting probabilities and knot sizes, both of which are not captured by ideal chain representations. This discrepancy comes from the suppression of small knots in real chains, which is strongest for very flexible chains because excluded volume effects are still active locally and become weaker with increasing semiflexibility. Our findings suggest that corrections to ideal behavior are indeed similar for the two scenarios of real chains and that structure and topology of a chain in a melt can be approximately reproduced by a corresponding $\theta$-chain.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation and structure of squirmer suspensions under gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of gravity on the collective motion of living microswimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, is pivotal to unravel not only bio-convection patterns but also the settling of bacterial biofilms on solid surfaces. In this work, we investigate suspensions of microswimmers under the influence of a gravitational field and hydrodynamics, simulated via dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) coarse-grained model. We first study the collective sedimentation of passive colloids and microswimmers of the puller and pusher types upon increasing the imposed gravitational field and compare with previous results. Once sedimentation occurs, we observe that, as the gravitational field increases, the bottom layer undergoes a transition to an ordered state compatible with a hexagonal crystal. In comparison with passive colloids, both pullers and pushers easily rearrange at the bottom layer to anneal defects. Specifically, pullers are better than pushers in preserving the hexagonal order of the bottom mono-layer at high gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking in two dimensions on ultra-fast time scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13433v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melting of two-dimensional mono-crystals is described within the celebrated Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young scenario (KTHNY-Theory) by the dissociation of topological defects. It describes the shielding of elasticity due to thermally activated topological defects until shear elasticity disappears. As a well defined continuous phase transition, freezing and melting should be reversible and independent of history. However, this is not the case: cooling an isotropic 2D fluid with a finite but nonzero rate does not end in mono-crystals. The symmetry can not be broken globally but only locally in the thermodynamic limit due to the critical slowing down of order parameter fluctuations. This results in finite sized domains with the same order parameter. For linear cooling rates, the domain size is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, originally developed for the defect formation of the primordial Higgs-field shortly after the Big-Bang. In the present manuscript, we investigate the limit of the deepest descent quench on a colloidal monolayer and resolve the time dependence of structure formation for (local) symmetry breaking. Quenching to various target temperatures below the melting point (deep in the crystalline phase and just close to the transition), we find universal behaviour if the timescale is re-scaled properly.</description>

      <title>Elucidating chirality transfer in liquid crystals of viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is ubiquitous in nature across all length scales, with major implications spanning the fields of biology, chemistry and physics to materials science. How chirality propagates from nanoscale building blocks to meso- and macroscopic helical structures remains an open issue. Here, working with a canonical system of filamentous viruses, we demonstrate that their self-assembly into chiral liquid crystal phases quantitatively results from the interplay between two main mechanisms of chirality transfer: electrostatic interactions from the helical charge patterns on the virus surface, and fluctuation-based helical deformations leading to viral backbone helicity. Our experimental and theoretical approach provides a comprehensive framework for deciphering how chirality is hierarchically and quantitatively propagated across spatial scales. Our work highlights the ways in which supramolecular helicity may arise from subtle chiral contributions of opposite handedness which either act cooperatively or competitively, thus accounting for the multiplicity of chiral behaviors observed for nearly identical molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Dense Suspensions in Rotary Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel unsteady shear protocol, which we name Rotary Shear (RS), where the flow and vorticity directions are continuously rotated around the velocity gradient direction by imposing two out-of-phase oscillatory shear (OS) in orthogonal directions. We perform numerical simulations of dense suspensions of rigid non-Brownian spherical particles at volume fractions ($\phi$) between 0.40 and 0.55 subject to this new RS protocol and compare to the classical OS protocol. We find that the suspension viscosity displays a similar non-monotonic response as the strain amplitude ($\gamma_0$) is increased: a minimum viscosity is found at an intermediate, volume-fraction dependent strain amplitude. However, the suspension dynamics is different in the new protocol. Unlike the OS protocol, suspensions under RS do not show self-adsorbing states at any $\gamma_0$ and do not undergo the reversible-irreversible transition: the stroboscropic particle dynamics are always diffusive, which we attribute to the fact that the RS protocol is irreversible. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce a reversible-RS (RRS) protocol, a combination of RS and OS, where we rotate the shear direction (as in RS) until it is instantaneously reversed (as in OS), and find the resulting rheology and dynamics to be closer to OS. Detailed microstructure analysis shows that both the OS and RRS protocols result in a contact-free, isotropic to an in-contact, anisotropic microstructure at the dynamically reversible-to-irreversible transition. The RS protocol does not render such a transition, and the dynamics remain diffusive with an in-contact, anisotropic microstructure for all strain amplitudes.</description>

      <title>The Dean-Kawasaki equation and stochastic density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation, which is at the basis of stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), was proposed in the mid-nineties to describe the evolution of the density of interacting Brownian particles, which can represent a large number of systems such as colloidal suspensions, supercooled liquids, polymer melts, biological molecules, active or chemotactic particles, or ions in solution. This theoretical framework, which can be summarized as a mathematical reformulation of the coupled overdamped Langevin equations that govern the dynamics of the particles, has attracted a significant amount of attention during the past thirty years. In this review, I present the context in which this framework was introduced, and I recall the main assumptions and calculation techniques that are employed to derive the DK equation. Then, in the broader context of statistical mechanics, I show how SDFT is connected to other theories, such fluctuating hydrodynamics, macroscopic fluctuation theory, or mode-coupling theory. The mathematical questions that are raised by the DK equation are presented in a non-specialist language. In the last parts of the review, I show how the original result was extended in several directions, I present the different strategies and approximations that have been employed to solve the DK equation, both analytically and numerically. I finally list the different situations where SDFT was employed to describe the fluctuations of Brownian suspensions, from the physics of active matter to the description of charged particles and electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Crystal to liquid cross-over in the active Calogero-Moser model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system comprising of $N$ run-and-tumble particles confined in a harmonic trap interacting via a repulsive inverse-square power-law interaction. This is the ``active" version of the Calogero-Moser system where the particles are associated with telegraphic noise with two possible states $\pm v_0$. We numerically compute the global density profile in the steady state which shows interesting crossovers between three different regimes: as the activity increases, we observe a change from a density with sharp peaks characteristic of a crystal region to a smooth bell-shaped density profile, passing through the intermediate stage of a smooth Wigner semi-circle characteristic of a liquid phase. We also investigate analytically the crossover between the crystal and the liquid regions by computing the covariance of the positions of these particles in the steady state in the weak noise limit. It is achieved by using the method introduced in Touzo {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 109}, 014136 (2024)] to study the active Dyson Brownian motion. Our analytical results are corroborated by thorough numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scaling behavior of Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes in the ordered phase of the Vicsek model, introducing a phenomenological equation of motion (EOM) incorporating a previously overlooked non-linear term. This term arises from the interaction between velocity fields and density fluctuations, leading to new scaling behaviors. We derive exact scaling exponents in two dimensions, which reproduce the isotropic scaling behavior reported in a prior numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Exploring noisy Jeffery orbits: A combined Fokker-Planck and Langevin analysis in 2D and 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of non-spherical particles in a shear-flow is of significant practical and theoretical interest. These systems have been the object of numerous investigations since the pioneering work of Jeffery a century ago. His eponymous orbits describe the deterministic motion of an isolated, rod-like particle in a shear flow. Subsequently, the effect of adding noise was investigated. The theory has been applied to colloidal particles, macromolecules, anisometric granular particles and most recently to microswimmers, for example bacteria. We study the Jeffery orbits of elongated particles subject to noise using Langevin simulations and a Fokker-Planck equation. We extend the analytical solution for infinitely thin needles ($\beta=1$) obtained by Doi and Edwards to particles with arbitrary shape factor ($0\le \beta\le 1$) and validate the theory by comparing it with simulations. We examine the rotation of the particle around the vorticity axis and study the orientational order matrix. We use the latter to obtain scalar order parameters $s$ and $r$ describing nematic ordering and biaxiality from the orientational distribution function. The value of $s$ (nematic ordering) increases monotonically with increasing P\'eclet number, while $r$ (measure of biaxiality) displays a maximum value. From perturbation theory we obtain simple expressions that provide accurate descriptions at low noise (or large P\'eclet numbers). We also examine the orientational distribution in the v-grad v plane and in the perpendicular direction. Finally we present the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for a strictly two-dimensional (2D) system. For the same noise amplitude the average rotation speed of the particle in 3D is larger than in 2D.</description>

      <title>The influence of active agent motility on SIRS epidemiological dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Brownian disks moving in two dimensions that exchange information about their internal state stochastically are chosen to model epidemic spread in a self-propelled population of agents under the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) framework. The state of infection of an agent, or disk, governs its self-propulsion speed; consequently, the activity of the agents in the system varies in time. Two different protocols (one-to-one and one-to-many) are considered for the transmission of disease from the infected to susceptible populations. The effectiveness of the two protocols are practically identical at high values of the infection transmission rate. The one-to-many protocol, however, outperforms the one-to-one protocol at lower values of the infection transmission rate. Salient features of the macroscopic SIRS model are revisited, and compared to predictions from the agent-based model. Lastly, the motility induced phase separation in a population of such agents with a fluctuating fraction of active disks is found to be well-described by theories governing phase separation in a mixture of active and passive particles with a constant fraction of passive disks.</description>

      <title>Pulling apart the mechanisms that lead to jammed knitted fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical behavior of jammed knitted fabrics, where geometric confinement leads to an initially stiff mechanical response that softens into low stiffness behavior with additional applied stress. We show that the jammed regime is distinguished by changes in yarn geometry and contact rearrangement that must occur to allow the individual stitches to stretch. These rearrangements allow for the relaxation of high residual contact forces that are present within jammed fabric, altering the low-strain response. We demonstrate that fabric jamming can be induced or reduced by changing either the constituent yarn or the fabric manufacturing parameters. Analysis of experimental samples shows that changing the "stitch size" in manufacturing affects both the in situ yarn radius and the length of yarn per stitch, both of which affect jamming.</description>

      <title>Algebraic depletion interactions in two-temperature mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase separation that occurs in two-temperature mixtures, which are driven out of equilibrium at the local scale, has been thoroughly characterized, but much less is known about the depletion interactions that drive it. Using numerical simulations in dimension 2, we show that the depletion interactions extend beyond two particle diameters in dilute systems, as expected at equilibrium, and decay algebraically with an exponent $-4$. Solving for the $N$-particle distribution function in the stationary state, perturbatively in the interaction potential, we show that algebraic correlations with an exponent $-2d$ arise from triplets of particles at different temperatures in spatial dimension $d$. Finally, simulations allow us to extend our results beyond the perturbative limit.</description>

      <title>A simulation platform for slender, semiflexible, and inextensible fibers with Brownian hydrodynamics and steric repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last few years have witnessed an explosion of new numerical methods for filament hydrodynamics. Aside from their ubiquity in biology, physics, and engineering, filaments present unique challenges from an applied-mathematical point of view. Their slenderness, inextensibility, semiflexibility, and meso-scale nature all require numerical methods that can handle multiple lengthscales in the presence of constraints. Accounting for Brownian motion while keeping the dynamics in detailed balance and on the constraint is difficult, as is including a background solvent, which couples the dynamics of multiple filaments together in a suspension. In this paper, we present a simulation platform for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament dynamics which includes nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric repulsion. For nonlocal hydrodynamics, we define the mobility on a single filament using line integrals of Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa regularized singularities, and numerically preserve the symmetric positive definite property by using a thicker regularization width for the nonlocal integrals than for the self term. For steric repulsion, we introduce a soft local repulsive potential defined as a double-integral over two filaments, then present a scheme to identify and evaluate the nonzero components of the integrand. Using a temporal integrator developed in previous work, we demonstrate that Langevin dynamics sample from the equilibrium distribution of free filament shapes, and that the modeling error in using the thicker regularization is small. We conclude with two examples, sedimenting filaments and cross-linked fiber networks, in which nonlocal hydrodynamics does and does not generate long-range flow fields, respectively. In the latter case, we show that the effect of hydrodynamics can be accounted for through steric repulsion.</description>

      <title>When Theory Meets Experiment: What Does it Take to Accurately Predict $^1$H NMR Dipolar Relaxation Rates in Neat Liquid Water from Theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we compute the $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while considering also nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions, and is including a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical informations from CCMD trajectories are considered including a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, according to the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H-H vector $D_0\times\tau_\mathrm{HH}$. The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike to what was predicted earlier from classical MD simulations.</description>
