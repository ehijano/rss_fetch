      <title>Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute free energies from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using diffusion-denoising generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating -- rather than minimizing -- the dissipation along an alchemical transition as the functional of a nonadiabatic potential, which plays the role of a diffusion-denoising protocol. Applying the algorithm to compute alchemical free energies of simple atomistic models shows it can significantly cut the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at no loss of accuracy compared with thermodynamic integration.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Chlorophyll Imaging for Non-Invasive Plant Tissue Assessment Using a Silicon-Rich Nitride Metalens Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive imaging enhances contrast and reveals structural features in biological tissues that are often missed by intensity-based methods, but its adoption is limited by bulky optics. We present a compact silicon-rich nitride (SRN) metalens array for high-resolution, polarization-resolved imaging of plant tissue at the chlorophyll absorption peak (660\,nm). The array integrates orthogonally sensitive metalenses to simultaneously capture X- and Y-linearly polarized transmission images, enabling real-time, label-free assessment of plant microstructure and stress responses. Polarization fusion and difference mapping reveal structural anisotropy and pigment variation in both healthy and stressed leaves. The SRN metalens, designed via an inverse approach using birefringent meta-atoms and fabricated through CMOS-compatible processes, achieves a large numerical aperture, high transmission, and spectral alignment with biological absorbers. This work demonstrates the feasibility of compact, integrated polarization-resolved imaging, offering a scalable alternative to conventional systems. The approach holds potential for biomedical and agricultural applications, where detecting subtle polarization-dependent changes could enable early diagnosis and tissue characterization</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under prevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large negative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by antibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To explain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that coherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect photon emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus dimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on fluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could extend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate operations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits. More broadly, the results highlight a structural design principle -- a "bioexciton motif" -- that links excitonic coupling, decoherence, and protein architecture, pointing to general rules by which biology both constrains and inspires quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Adapting Biological Reflexes for Dynamic Reorientation in Space Manipulator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic arms mounted on spacecraft, known as space manipulator systems (SMSs), are critical for enabling on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and debris removal. However, controlling these systems in microgravity remains a significant challenge due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and the spacecraft base. This study explores the potential of using biological inspiration to address this issue, focusing on animals, particularly lizards, that exhibit mid-air righting reflexes. Based on similarities between SMSs and these animals in terms of behavior, morphology, and environment, their air-righting motion trajectories are extracted from high-speed video recordings using computer vision techniques. These trajectories are analyzed within a multi-objective optimization framework to identify the key behavioral goals and assess their relative importance. The resulting motion profiles are then applied as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers used to track them. The findings provide a step toward translating evolved animal behaviors into interpretable, adaptive control strategies for space robotics, with implications for improving maneuverability and robustness in future missions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between colloidal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14652v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the pair interaction potential between electrically like-charged particles in solution reveals a strong and long-ranged attractive force. This counterintuitive attraction has been suggested to arise from the orientation of solvent molecules at the interface between the object and the electrolyte. Measuring interactions between charged microspheres carrying a variety of surface chemistries reveals that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. Furthermore, the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force depends on particle properties. The observations highlight significant departures from current thinking and the need for a model of interparticle interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations.</description>

      <title>A ubiquitous transfer function links interacting elements to emerging property of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03347v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of complex systems, self-organization magnifies the compounding effects of element interactions by propagating, modifying, and enhancing functionality, ultimately leading to emergent system properties. The intricacies of self-organization make unveiling the elusive link between element interactions and emergent system properties akin to finding the proverbial Holy Grail. In the search for identifying a method to predict system-level properties, we used an inductive approach to bypass the self-organization. By observing drug interactions within biological complex system, system property, efficacy, emerged as a smooth response surface in the multi-dimensional space of drug-system interactions, which can be represented by the Complex System Response (CSR) function. This CSR function has been successfully validated across diverse disease models in cell lines, animals, and clinical trials. Notably, the CSR function reveals that biological complex systems exhibit second-order non-linearity. In this study, we generalized the CSR function to physical complex systems, linking maximum compressive yielding stress to impactful manufacturing parameters of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. Remarkably though anticipated, the CSR function reveals the connection between the macroscale system property (compressive yielding stress) and the microstructure during self-organizing process. In addition, the second-order non-linear CSR functions ensure a single global optimum in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Preserved reptile scales retain microscopic features, revealing a new instance of convergent evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-scale structures on biological surfaces can profoundly impact how animals move, appear, and interact with their environments. Such textures may be especially important for limbless reptiles, such as snakes and legless lizards, because their skin serves as the primary interface with the world around them. Here, we examine ventral microstructures of several limbless reptiles, which are hypothesized to be highly specialized to aid locomotion via frictional interactions. Inspired by prior studies that investigated potential links between microtextures, phylogeny, habitat, and locomotion -- but that were limited by their reliance on shed skins -- we characterized the structures present on preserved museum specimens and found that they are quantitatively similar to those found on shed skins. Using this result, we confirmed a previously hypothesized -- but untested due to the lack of shed skins -- third independent evolution of sidewinding-specific isotropic microtexture. Specifically, we examined a museum-preserved \textit{Bitis peringueyi} specimen and identified a new instance of convergent evolution in sidewinding viper microstructures: the loss of micro-spikes (present on many snake species) and the appearance of micro-pits with a characteristic spacing. Our results reveal that museum-preserved specimens retain intact microtextures, greatly expanding the availability of samples for evolutionary studies.</description>
