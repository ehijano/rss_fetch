      <title>Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to multimode nonlinear optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spatiotemporal solitary waves of a graded-index multimode optical fiber with a parabolic transverse index profile. Using the nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation approach, we derive an effective one-dimensional Lagrangian associated with the Laguerre-Gauss modes with a generic radial mode number p and azimuthal index m. We show that the form of the equations of motion for any Laguerre-Gauss mode is particularly simple, and we derive the critical power for the collapse for every mode. By solving the nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation, we provide a comparison of the stationary mode profiles in the radial and temporal coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple description of a zero-temperature phase transition between a liquid metal and a solid. The critical point has a Fermi surface as well as a Bose surface, a sphere in momentum space of gapless bosonic excitations. We find a fixed point of the renormalization group governing such a non-Fermi liquid, using an expansion in the codimension of both the Fermi and Bose surfaces. We comment on the nature of the solid phase and possible physical realizations.</description>

      <title>Exact Current Fluctuations in a Tight-Binding Chain with Dephasing Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on an infinite interval, we exactly calculate the variance of the integrated current for a step initial condition with average densities, $\rho_a$ on the negative axis and $\rho_b$ on the positive axis. Our exact solution reveals that the presence of dephasing, no matter how small, alters the nature of current fluctuations from ballistic to diffusive in the long-time limit. The derivation relies on the Bethe ansatz on the infinite interval and a nontrivial parameter dependence, referred to as the $\omega$-dependence, of the moment generating function for the integrated current. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic form of the variance and a numerically obtained cumulant generating function coincide with those in the symmetric simple exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Swinging small quantum systems out of available values of control parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a quantum system is prepared in its many-body ground state, it can be adiabatically driven to another ground state by changing its control parameter. However, relying on adiabaticity is experimentally unjustified. Moreover, the target value of the control parameter may occur outside the experimentally accessible range. The indicated target state, however, can still be reached within a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided its decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol can be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper, we show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems treating interaction strength as the control parameter. We believe that the proposed approach can be creatively extended to various complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nonhermitian topological zero modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmode of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. Recently, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been extended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as gain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra can be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane, whether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines, respectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be continuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the analytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero energy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct phases, by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian regime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities and is not affected by the details of the spatial dependence of the scalar fields. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of boundary modes in nonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of collective modes in a Bose-Einstein condensate: From single to double excitation periods</title>

Abstract: Collective modes are coherent excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), and their study provides insight into the macroscopic quantum phenomena that govern these systems. Collective mode frequencies can be used to probe the properties of BECs, such as the trap geometry, the interatomic interactions, and the presence of defects; hence, it is essential to develop methods for high-resolution determination of collective mode frequencies. A standard technique consists of a single pulse of an external oscillatory field, which we denote Rabi-like due to the analogy with the field of nuclear magnetic resonances. In this work, we propose a method to achieve a better resolution than the Rabi-like protocol, which consists of two oscillating fields separated in time, which we call Ramsey-like. We focus on BECs in harmonic traps, considering mainly the quadrupole and breathing modes for different trap anisotropy values and comparing the results using single and double excitation zones. First, we employ a variational approach with a Thomas-Fermi ansatz, which gives rise to dynamical equations that are numerically solved. Then, we modeled the problem as a three-level system, offering a concise and alternative description of the same dynamics, enabling the idea of coherent control of these collective modes. Both approaches show that the Ramsey-like protocol provides a better resolution than the Rabi-like. This offers the possibility of measuring collective mode frequencies with higher precision, which is important in experiments where they are used as indirect measurements of properties that are difficult to probe.</description>

      <title>Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic $^{23}$Na and fermionic $^6$Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle $g^{(2)}$ correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of $g^{(2)}$ for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear Rice-Mele model</title>

Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence (BEC) constitutes a fundamental concept within the domain of topological physics, elucidating the profound interplay between the topological invariants that characterize the bulk states and the emergent edge states. A recent highlight along this research line consists of establishing BEC under the eigenvalue's nonlinearity in a linear Hamiltonian by introducing auxiliary eigenvalues [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.126601}{ T. Isobe {\it et al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)}]. The purpose of this work aims to extend Isobe's analysis to uncover BEC of eigenvalue's nonlinearity in intrinsic nonlinear Hamiltonians. To achieve this, we numerically solve the nonlinear Rice-Mele (RM) model and identify two distinct types of nonlinear eigenvalues: the intrinsically nonlinear eigenvalues and the eigenvalue's nonlinearity introduced through the incorporation of auxiliary eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a novel form of BEC based on these auxiliary nonlinear eigenvalues, which we term the anomalous BEC of a nonlinear physical system. The concept of the anomalous BEC defined herein provides a novel perspective on the intricate interplay between topology and nonlinearity in the context of BEC.</description>

      <title>Probing $p$-wave effects in spin-density separation of Bose mixtures by dynamic structure factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mixtures of Bose gases with tunable $s$- and $p$-wave interactions offer a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated phases and exotic phenomena. While repulsive interactions often drive phase separation, the interplay of $p$-wave interactions with spin-density decoupling remains underexplored. In this work, we employ the path integal field theory to investigate the role of $p$-wave interactions in three-dimensional two-component Bose gas. We derive the Lee-Huang-Yang corrections to the ground-state energy and quantum depletion, revealing how $p$-wave interactions modify equations of state of the model system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $p$-wave interactions predominantly renormalize the spin-sector effective mass in the language of decoupling the density and spin-density degrees of freedom. This effect manifests in the dynamic structure factor, computed via hydrodynamic theory, where Bragg spectroscopy can detect a tunable splitting between spin and density modes. Our results bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, offering insights into anisotropic interaction effects in quantum gases and their implications for probing emergent phases.</description>

      <title>Optical pumping through the Liouvillian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Liouvillian skin effect describes the boundary affinity of Liouvillian eignemodes that originates from the intrinsic non-Hermiticity of the Liouvillian superoperators. Dynamically, it manifests as directional flow in the transient dynamics, and the accumulation of population near open boundaries at long times. Intriguingly, similar dynamic phenomena exist in the well-known process of optical pumping, where the system is driven into a desired state (or a dark-state subspace) through the interplay of dissipation and optical drive. In this work, we show that typical optical pumping processes can indeed be understood in terms of the Liouvillian skin effect. By studying the Liouvillian spectra under different boundary conditions, we reveal that the Liouvillian spectra of the driven-dissipative pumping process sensitively depend on the boundary conditions in the state space, a signature that lies at the origin of the Liouvillian skin effect. Such a connection provides insights and practical means for designing efficient optical-pumping schemes through engineering Liouvillian gaps under the open-boundary condition. Based on these understandings, we show that the efficiency of a typical side-band cooling scheme for trapped ions can be dramatically enhanced by introducing counterintuitive dissipative channels. Our results provide a useful perspective for optical pumping, with interesting implications for state preparation and cooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable systems feature an infinite number of conserved charges and on hydrodynamic scales are described by generalised hydrodynamics (GHD). This description breaks down when the integrability is weakly broken and sufficiently large space-time-scales are probed. The emergent hydrodynamics depends then on the charges conserved by the perturbation. We focus on nearly-integrable Galilean-invariant systems with conserved particle number, momentum and energy. Basing on the Boltzmann approach to integrability-breaking we describe dynamics of the system with GHD equation supplemented with a collision term. The limit of large space-time-scales is addressed using Chapman-Enskog expansion adapted to the GHD equation. For length scales larger than $\sim \lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is integrability-breaking parameter, we recover Navier-Stokes equations and find transport coefficients: viscosity and thermal conductivity. At even larger length scales, this description crosses over to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, characteristic to generic non-integrable one-dimensional fluids. Employing nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics we estimate this crossover length scale as $ \sim \lambda^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Yang-Lee zeros of the classical Ising model through dynamic quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum dynamics, the Loschmidt amplitude is analogous to the partition function in the canonical ensemble. Zeros in the partition function indicate a phase transition, while the presence of zeros in the Loschmidt amplitude indicates a dynamical quantum phase transition. Based on the classical-quantum correspondence, we demonstrate that the partition function of a classical Ising model is equivalent to the Loschmidt amplitude in non-Hermitian dynamics, thereby mapping an Ising model with variable system size to the non-Hermitian dynamics. It follows that the Yang-Lee zeros and the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the classical Ising model correspond to the critical times of the dynamic quantum phase transitions and the exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, respectively. Our work reveals an inner connection between Yang-Lee zeros and non-Hermitian dynamics, offering a dynamic characterization of the former.</description>

      <title>Making Truncated Wigner for dissipative spins 'plain easy'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA approach outperforms the cumulant expansion method in certain models and performs comparably well in others, all while offering significantly lower computational costs and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.</description>
