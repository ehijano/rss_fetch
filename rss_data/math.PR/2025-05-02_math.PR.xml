      <title>Queueing models with random resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study some queueing models with random resetting, including Markovian and non--Markovian models. The Markovian models include M/M/1, M/M/r and M/M/$\infty$ queues with random resetting, in which a continuous-time Markov chain is formulated and the transition from each state includes a resetting to state zero in addition to the arrival and service transitions. Hence the chains are no longer a birth and death process as in the classical models. We explicitly characterize the stationary distributions of the queueing processes in these models. It is worth noting the distinction of the stability conditions from the standard models, that is, the positive recurrence of the Markov chains does not require the usual traffic intensity to be less than one.
  The non--Markovian models include GI/GI/1, GI/GI/$r$ and GI/GI/$\infty$ queues with random resetting to state zero. For GI/GI/1 and GI/GI/$r$ queues, we consider random resetting at arrival times, and introduce modified Lindley recursions and Kiefer--Wolfowitz recursions, respectively. Using an operator representation for these recursions, we characterize the stationary distributions via convergent series, as solutions to the modified Wiener--Hopf equations. For GI/GI/1 queues with random resetting, a particularly interesting case is when the difference of the service and interarrival times is positive, for which an explicit characterization of the stationary distribution of the delay/waiting time is provided via the associated characteristic functions. For GI/GI/$\infty$ queues, we also consider random resettings at arrival times, by utilizing a version of the Kiefer--Wolfowitz recursion motivated from that for GI/GI/$r$ queues, and also characterize the corresponding stationary distribution.</description>

      <title>Affine constraints in non-reversible diffusions with degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the realisation of affine constraints on nonreversible stochastic differential equations (SDE) by strong confining forces. We prove that the confined dynamics converges pathwise and on bounded time intervals to the solution of a projected SDE in the limit of infinitely strong confinement, where the projection is explicitly given and depends on the choice of the confinement force. We present results for linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, but they straightforwardly generalise to nonlinear SDEs. Moreover, for linear OU processes that admit a unique invariant measure, we discuss conditions under which the limit also preserves the long-term properties of the SDE. More precisely, we discuss choices for the design of the confinement force which in the limit yield a projected dynamics with invariant measure that agrees with the conditional invariant measure of the unconstrained processes for the given constraint. The theoretical findings are illustrated with suitable numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Elephant random walk with polynomially decaying steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a variation of the elephant random walk whose steps are polynomially decaying. At each time $k$, the walker's step size is $k^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma&gt;0$. We investigate effects of the step size exponent $\gamma$ and the memory parameter $\alpha\in [-1,1]$ on the long-time behavior of the walker. For fixed $\alpha$, it admits phase transition from divergence to convergence (localization) at $\gamma_{c}(\alpha)=\max \{\alpha,1/2\}$. This means that large enough memory effect can shift the critical point for localization. Moreover, we obtain quantitative limit theorems which provide a detailed picture of the long-time behavior of the walker.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the recursion $X_{n+1}=\sum_{i=0}^n \epsilon_{n,i}X_{n-i}$, where $\epsilon_{n,i}$ are i.i.d. (Bernoulli) random variables taking values in $\{-1,1\}$, and $X_0=1$, $X_{-j}=0$ for $j&gt;0$. We prove that almost surely, $n^{-1}\log |X_n|\to \bar \gamma&gt;0$, where $\bar \gamma$ is an appropriate Lyapunov exponent. This answers a question of Viswanath and Trefethen (\textit{SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 19:564--581, 1998}).</description>

      <title>L\'evy processes under level-dependent Poissonian switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive identities for the upward and downward exit problems and resolvents for a process whose motion changes between two L\'evy processes if it is above (or below) a barrier $b$ and coincides with a Poissonian arrival time. This can be expressed in the form of a (hybrid) stochastic differential equation, for which the existence of its solution is also discussed. All identities are given in terms of new generalisations of scale functions (counterparts of the scale functions from the theory of L\'evy processes). To illustrate the applicability of our results, the probability of ruin is obtained for a risk process with delays in the dividend payments.</description>

      <title>A stochastic epidemic model with memory of the last infection and waning immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the article of Forien, Pang, Pardoux and Zotsa: Arxiv preprint Arxiv2210.04667(2022), on epidemic models with varying infectivity and waning immunity, to incorporate the memory of the last infection. To this end, we introduce a parametric approach and consider a piecewise deterministic Markov process modeling both the evolution of the parameter, also called the trait, and the age of infection of individuals over time. At each new infection, a new trait is randomly chosen for the infected individual according to a Markov kernel, and their age is reset to zero. In the large population limit, we derive a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the density of traits and ages. The main goal is to study the conditions under which endemic equilibria exist for the deterministic PDE model and to establish an endemicity threshold that depends on the model parameters. The local stability of these equilibria is also analyzed. The endemicity threshold is computed for several examples, including models that incorporate a vaccination policy, and a local stability result is obtained for a memory-free SIS-type model.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of a weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process in the framework of regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a parabolically rescaled and suitably renormalised height function of a weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process on a circle converges to the Cole-Hopf solution of the KPZ equation. This is an analogue of the celebrated result by Bertini and Giacomin from 1997 for the exclusion process on a circle with any particle density. The main goal of this article is to analyse the interacting particle system using the framework of regularity structures without applying the Gaertner transform, a discrete version of the Cole-Hopf transform which linearises the KPZ equation. Our analysis relies on discretisation framework for regularity structures developed by Erhard and Hairer as well as estimates for iterated integrals with respect to cadlag martingales derived by Grazieschi, Matetski and Weber. The main technical challenge addressed in this work is the renormalisation procedure which requires a subtle analysis of regularity preserving discrete convolution operators.</description>

      <title>Expected First Return Times for Random Walks on Toroidal and Bounded Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walks on an $n \times n$ grid with opposite edges identified, forming a two-dimensional torus with $(n-1)^2$ unique states. We prove that, starting from any fixed state (e.g., the origin), the expected first return time is exactly $(n-1)^2$.
  Our proof generalizes naturally to rectangular grids of size $n \times m$, where the expected first return time becomes $(n-1)(m-1)$. More broadly, we extend the argument to $d$-dimensional toroidal grids of size $n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d$, where the expected first return time is $n_1 n_2 \cdots n_d $. We also discuss the problem under alternative boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>The local coupling of noise technique and its application to lower error bounds for strong approximation of SDEs with irregular coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in approximation methods for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-Lipschitz continuous coefficients has increased. We show lower bounds for the $L^p$-error of such methods in the case of approximation at a single point in time or globally in time. On the one hand, we show that for a large class of piecewise Lipschitz continuous drifts and non-additive diffusions the best possible $L^p$-error rate for final time approximation that can be achieved by any method based on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most $3/4$, which was previously known only for additive diffusions. Moreover, we show that the best $L^p$-error rate for global approximation that can be achieved by any method based on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most $1/2$ when the drift is locally bounded and the diffusion is locally Lipschitz continuous.
  For the derivation of the lower bounds we introduce a new method of proof: the local coupling of noise technique. Using this technique when approximating a solution $X$ of the SDE at the final time, a lower bound for the $L^p$-error of any approximation method based on evaluations of the driving Brownian motion at the points $t_1 &lt; \dots &lt; t_n$ can be determined by the $L^p$-distances of solutions of the same SDE on $[t_{i-1}, t_i]$ with initial values $X_{t_{i-1}}$ and driving Brownian motions that are coupled at $t_{i-1}, t_i$ and independent, conditioned on the values of the Brownian motion at $t_{i-1}, t_i$.</description>

      <title>Higher-order asymptotic expansion with error estimate for the multidimensional Laplace-type integral under perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01310v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of the multidimensional Laplace-type integral with a perturbed phase function. Under suitable assumptions, we derive a higher-order asymptotic expansion with an error estimate, generalizing some previous results including Laplace's method. The key points of the proof are a precise asymptotic analysis based on a lot of detailed Taylor expansions, and a careful consideration of the effects of the perturbations on the Hessian matrix of the phase function.</description>

      <title>Q Cells in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given set of transmitters such as cellular base stations or WiFi access points, is it possible to analytically characterize the set of locations that are "covered" in the sense that users at these locations experience a certain minimum quality of service? In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question, by providing explicit simple outer bounds and estimates for the coverage manifold. The key geometric elements of our analytical method are the Q cells, defined as the intersections of a small number of disks. The Q cell of a transmitter is an outer bound to the service region of the transmitter, and, in turn, the union of Q cells is an outer bound to the coverage manifold. In infinite networks, connections to the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio allow for a scaling of the Q cells to obtain accurate estimates of the coverage manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\varphi_i)_{i=1}^n$ be mutually orthogonal functions on a probability space such that $\|\varphi_i\|_\infty \leq 1 $ for all $i \in [n]$. Let $\alpha &gt; 0$. Let $\Phi(u) = u^2 \log^{\alpha}(u)$ for $u \geq u_{0}$, and $\Phi(u) = c(\alpha) u^2$ otherwise. $u_0$ and $c(\alpha)$ are constants chosen so that $\Phi$ is a Young function, depending only on $\alpha$. We show that with probability at least $1/4$ over subsets $I$ of $[n]$ the following holds, $|I| \geq \frac{n}{e \log^{\alpha+1}(n)} $ and for any $a \in \mathbb{C}^n$, $$ \left \|\sum_{i \in I} a_i \varphi_i \right \|_{\Phi} \leq K(\alpha) \log^{\alpha}(\log n) \cdot \|a\|_2. $$ $K(\alpha)$ is a constant depending only on $\alpha$. \vskip 0.125in In the main Theorem of \cite{Ryou22}, Ryou proved the result above to $O_n(1)$ factors when the Orlicz space is a $L^p(\log L)^{\alpha}$ space for $p &gt; 2$ where $|I| \sim \frac{n^{2/p}}{\log^{2 \alpha /p}(n)}$. However, their work did not extend to the case where $p=2$, an open question in \cite{Iosevich25}. Our result resolves the latter question up to $\log \log n$ factors. Moreover, our result sharpens the constants of Limonova's main result in \cite{Limonova23} from a factor of $\log n$ to a factor of $\log \log n$, if the orthogonal functions are bounded by a constant. In addition, our proof is much shorter and simpler than the latter's.</description>

      <title>Approximation to Deep Q-Network by Stochastic Delay Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the significant breakthroughs that the Deep Q-Network (DQN) has brought to reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis remains limited. In this paper, we construct a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based on the DQN algorithm and estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between them. We provide an upper bound for the distance and prove that the distance between the two converges to zero as the step size approaches zero. This result allows us to understand DQN's two key techniques, the experience replay and the target network, from the perspective of continuous systems. Specifically, the delay term in the equation, corresponding to the target network, contributes to the stability of the system. Our approach leverages a refined Lindeberg principle and an operator comparison to establish these results.</description>

      <title>The iterated Dirichlet process and applications to Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an i.i.d. sequence of random variables, taking values in some space $S$, whose underlying distribution is unknown. In problems of Bayesian inference, one models this unknown distribution as a random measure, and the law of this random measure is the prior. When $S = \{0, 1\}$, a commonly used prior is the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$, or more generally, the beta distribution. When $S$ is finite, the analogous choice is the Dirichlet distribution. For a general space $S$, we are led naturally to the Dirichlet process (see [Ferguson, 1973]).
  Here, we consider an array of random variables, and in so doing are led to what we call the iterated Dirichlet process (IDP). We define the IDP and then show how to compute the posterior distribution, given a finite set of observations, using the method of sequential imputation. Ordinarily, this method requires the existence of certain joint density functions, which the IDP lacks. We therefore present a new, more general proof of the validity of sequential imputation, and show that the hypotheses of our proof are satisfied by the IDP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study post-Lie deformations of a pre-Lie algebra, namely deforming a pre-Lie algebra into a post-Lie algebra. We construct the differential graded Lie algebra that governs post-Lie deformations of a pre-Lie algebra. We also develop the post-Lie cohomology theory for a pre-Lie algebra, by which we classify infinitesimal post-Lie deformations of a pre-Lie algebra using the second cohomology group. The rigidity of such kind of deformations is also characterized using the second cohomology group. Finally, we apply this deformation theory to Regularity Structures. We prove that the post-Lie algebraic structure on the decorated trees which appears spontaneously in Regularity Structures is a post-Lie deformation of a pre-Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>The heat flow conjecture for polynomials and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the roots of a polynomial of degree $N$, when the polynomial itself is evolving according to the heat flow. We propose a general conjecture for the large-$N$ limit of this evolution. Specifically, we propose (1) that the log potential of the limiting root distribution should evolve according to a certain first-order, nonlinear PDE, and (2) that the limiting root distribution at a general time should be the push-forward of the initial distribution under a certain explicit transport map. These results should hold for sufficiently small times, that is, until singularities begin to form.
  We offer three lines of reasoning in support of our conjecture. First, from a random matrix perspective, the conjecture is supported by a deformation theorem for the second moment of the characteristic polynomial of certain random matrix models. Second, from a dynamical systems perspective, the conjecture is supported by the computation of the second derivative of the roots with respect to time, which is formally small before singularities form. Third, from a PDE perspective, the conjecture is supported by the exact PDE\ satisfied by the log potential of the empirical root distribution of the polynomial, which formally converges to the desired PDE as $N\rightarrow \infty.$ We also present a "multiplicative" version of the the conjecture, supported by similar arguments.
  Finally, we verify rigorously that the conjectures hold at the level of the holomorphic moments.</description>

      <title>Some results on probabilities of moderate deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{X, X_{n}; n \geq 1\}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. non-degenerate real-valued random variables with $\mathbb{E}X^{2} &lt; \infty$. Let $S_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}$, $n \geq 1$. Let $g(\cdot): ~[0, \infty) \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ be a nondecreasing regularly varying function with index $\rho \geq 0$ and $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} g(t) = \infty$. Let $\mu = \mathbb{E}X$ and $\sigma^{2} = \mathbb{E}(X - \mu)^{2}$. In this paper, on the scale $g(\log n)$, we obtain precise asymptotic estimates for the probabilities of moderate deviations of the form $\displaystyle \log \mathbb{P}\left(S_{n} - n \mu &gt; x \sqrt{ng(\log n)} \right)$, $\displaystyle \log \mathbb{P}\left(S_{n} - n \mu &lt; -x \sqrt{ng(\log n)} \right)$, and $\displaystyle \log \mathbb{P}\left(\left|S_{n} - n \mu \right| &gt; x \sqrt{ng(\log n)} \right)$ for all $x &gt; 0$. Unlike those known results in the literature, the moderate deviation results established in this paper depend on both the variance and the asymptotic behavior of the tail distribution of $X$.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the stochastic thin-film equation for the range of mobility exponents $n\in (2,3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, many existence results for the stochastic thin-film equation were established in the case of a quadratic mobility exponent $n=2$, in which the noise term $\partial_x(u^\frac{n}{2}\mathcal{W})$ becomes linear. In the case of a non-quadratic mobility exponent, results are only available in the situation that $n\ge \frac{8}{3}$ leaving the interval of mobility exponents $n\in (2,\frac{8}{3})$ untreated. In this article we resolve the current gap in the literature by presenting a proof, which works under the assumption $n\in (2,3)$, i.e., the regime of weak slippage. The key idea is to use that the $\log$-entropy dissipation coincides with the energy production due to the noise. To realize this idea, we approximate the stochastic thin-film equation by stochastic thin-film equations with inhomogeneous mobility functions, which behave like a higher power near $0$. As a consequence the approximate solutions are non-negative, which is vital to use the $\log$-entropy estimate.</description>

      <title>Time-Uniform Self-Normalized Concentration for Vector-Valued Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-normalized processes arise naturally in many learning-related tasks. While self-normalized concentration has been extensively studied for scalar-valued processes, there are few results for multidimensional processes outside of the sub-Gaussian setting. In this work, we construct a general, self-normalized inequality for multivariate processes that satisfy a simple yet broad sub-$\psi$ tail condition, which generalizes assumptions based on cumulant generating functions. From this general inequality, we derive an upper law of the iterated logarithm for sub-$\psi$ vector-valued processes, which is tight up to small constants. We show how our inequality can be leveraged to derive a variety of novel, self-normalized concentration inequalities under both light and heavy-tailed observations. Further, we provide applications in prototypical statistical tasks, such as parameter estimation in online linear regression, autoregressive modeling, and bounded mean estimation via a new (multivariate) empirical Bernstein concentration inequality.</description>

      <title>Improving the convergence of Markov chains via permutations and projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims at improving the convergence to equilibrium of finite ergodic Markov chains via permutations and projections. First, we prove that a specific mixture of permuted Markov chains arises naturally as a projection under the KL divergence or the squared-Frobenius norm. We then compare various mixing properties of the mixture with other competing Markov chain samplers and demonstrate that it enjoys improved convergence. This geometric perspective motivates us to propose samplers based on alternating projections to combine different permutations and to analyze their rate of convergence. We give necessary, and under some additional assumptions also sufficient, conditions for the projection to achieve stationarity in the limit in terms of the trace of the transition matrix. We proceed to discuss tuning strategies of the projection samplers when these permutations are viewed as parameters. Along the way, we reveal connections between the mixture and a Markov chain Sylvester's equation as well as assignment problems, and highlight how these can be used to understand and improve Markov chain mixing. We provide two examples as illustrations. In the first example, the projection sampler (with a suitable choice of the permutation) improves upon Metropolis-Hastings in a discrete bimodal distribution with a reduced relaxation time from exponential to polynomial in the system size, while in the second example, the mixture of permuted Markov chain yields a mixing time that is logarithmic in system size (with high probability under random permutation), compared to a linear mixing time in the Diaconis-Holmes-Neal sampler. Finally, we provide numerical experiments on statistical physics models to illustrate the improved mixing performance of the proposed projection samplers over standard Metropolis-Hastings.</description>

      <title>Anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations and their applications to nonzero-sum stochastic differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [J. Wen, Y. Shi, Stat. Probab. Lett. 156 (2020) 108599] the authors first introduced a kind of anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (anticipated BSVIEs, for short). By virtue of the duality principle, it is found in this paper that the anticipated BSVIEs can be applied to the study of stochastic differential games. For this in this paper we deeply investigate a more general class of anticipated BSVIEs whose generator includes both pointwise time-advanced functions and average time-advanced functions. In theory, the well-posedness and the comparison theorem of anticipated BSVIEs are established, and some regularity results of adapted M-solutions are proved by applying Malliavin calculus, which cover the previous results for BSVIEs. Further, using linear ABSVIEs as the adjoint equation, we present the maximum principle for the nonzero-sum differential game system of stochastic delay Volterra integral equations (SDVIEs, for short) for the first time. As one of the applications of the theorem, a Nash equilibrium point of the linear-quadratic differential game problem of SDVIEs is obtained.</description>

      <title>Recovering Small Communities in the Planted Partition Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze community recovery in the planted partition model (PPM) in regimes where the number of communities is arbitrarily large. We examine the three standard recovery regimes: exact recovery, almost exact recovery, and weak recovery. When communities vary in size, traditional accuracy- or alignment-based metrics become unsuitable for assessing the correctness of a predicted partition. To address this, we redefine these recovery regimes using the correlation coefficient, a more versatile metric for comparing partitions. We then demonstrate that $\textit{Diamond Percolation}$, an algorithm based on common-neighbors, successfully recovers communities under mild assumptions on edge probabilities, with minimal restrictions on the number and sizes of communities. As a key application, we consider the case where community sizes follow a power-law distribution, a characteristic frequently found in real-world networks. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first recovery results for such unbalanced partitions.</description>

      <title>Robust dividend policy: Equivalence of Epstein-Zin and Maenhout preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a continuous-time economy, this paper formulates the Epstein-Zin (EZ) preference for discounted dividends received by an investor as an EZ singular control utility. We introduce a backward stochastic differential equation with a aggregator integrated with respect to a singular control, prove its well-posedness, and show that it coincides with the EZ singular control utility. We then establish that this formulation is equivalent to a robust dividend policy chosen by the firm's executive under the Maenhout's ambiguity-averse preference. In particular, the robust dividend policy takes the form of a threshold strategy on the firm's surplus process, where the threshold level is characterized as the free boundary of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality. Therefore, dividend-caring investors can choose firms that match their preferences by examining stock's dividend policies and financial statements, whereas executives can make use of dividend to signal their confidence, in the form of ambiguity aversion, on realizing the earnings implied by their financial statements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Beginning with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, we obtain the corresponding Fisher information matrices and the $\alpha$-connections on their statistical manifolds. Furthermore, we explore statistical applications of this geometric framework. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly-decreasing tempered stable processes are presented as illustrative examples.</description>
