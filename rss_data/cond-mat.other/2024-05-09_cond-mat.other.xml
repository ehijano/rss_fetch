      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-space topological invariants were widely used to characterize chiral-symmetric higher-order topological phases (HOTPs). However, a momentum-space characterization to these HOTPs, which essentially reveals their intrinsic bulk-boundary correspondence and facilitates their detection in quantum simulation systems, is still lacking. Here, we propose an experimentally observable momentum-space characterization to the chiral-symmetric HOTPs by the concept of polarized topological charges. It makes a unified description to the HOTPs caused by the closing and reopening of band gap not only of the bulk states but also the edge states. Remarkably, these polarized topological charges can also be identified by measuring the pseudospin structures. A feasible scheme to detect the HOTPs in the $^{87}$Rb atomic system is given. Our work opens an avenue for characterization and experimental detection of the HOTPs in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Polar Metallic phase in Ultra-Thin Epitaxially-Strained RuO2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism refers to a wide class of compensated magnetic orders featuring magnetic sublattices with opposite spins related by rotational symmetry rather than inversion or translational operations, resulting in non-trivial spin splitting and high-order multipolar orders. Here, by combining theoretical analysis, electrical transport, X-ray and optical spectroscopies, and nonlinear optical measurements, we establish a phase diagram in hybrid molecular beam epitaxy-grown RuO2/TiO2 (110) films, mapping the broken symmetries along the altermagnetic/electronic/structural phase transitions as functions of film thickness and temperature. This phase diagram features a novel altermagnetic metallic polar phase in strained 2 nm samples, extending the concept of multiferroics to altermagnetic systems. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism upon epitaxial heterostructure design for emergent novel phases with multifunctionalities.</description>

      <title>Motion from Measurement: The Role of Symmetry of Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, measurements are dynamical processes and thus they should be capable of inducing currents. The symmetries of the Hamiltonian and measurement operator provide an organizing principle for understanding the conditions for such currents to emerge. The central role is played by the inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We classify the distinct behaviors that emerge from single and repeated measurements, with and without coupling to a dissipative bath. While the breaking of inversion symmetry alone is sufficient to generate currents through measurements, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the measurement operator leads to a dramatic increase in the magnitude of the currents. We consider the dependence on the measurement rate and find that the current is non-monotonic. Furthermore, nondegenerate measurements can lead to current loops within the steady state even in the Zeno limit.</description>
