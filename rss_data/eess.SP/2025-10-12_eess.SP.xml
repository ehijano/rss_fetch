      <title>UAV-Assisted 3-D Localization for IoT Networks Using a Simple and Efficient TDOA-AOA Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes an algebraic solution for the problem of 3-D source localization utilizing the minimum number of measurements, i.e., one Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and one Angle of Arrival (AOA) pair. The proposed method employs a closed-form weighted least squares estimator and enables the positioning using a single ground station and a cooperative UAV relaying the signal. Analytical derivations and simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving near-optimal performance aligned with the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) under moderate Gaussian noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Assisted Sensing: A Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental sensing limit of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is studied from a Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) perspective. Compared to conventional CRB, BCRB is independent of the exact values of sensing parameters and is not restricted by the unbiasedness of the estimator, thus offering a practical and comprehensive lower bound for evaluating sensing performance. A system where multiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed. For the single-target scenario, our analysis reveals a unique mismatch between the sensing centroid (i.e., the optimal PA position) and the distribution centroid (i.e., the center of the target's prior distribution), underscoring the necessity of dynamic PA repositioning. For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols are proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching beamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a single beamforming configuration across all slots. Based on these protocols, both the total power minimization problem under a BCRB threshold and the min-max BCRB problem under a total power constraint are formulated. By leveraging Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, these problems are equivalently converted into a search over PA positions and solved using an element-wise algorithm. Numerical results show that i)~PASS, endowed with large-scale reconfigurability, can significantly enhance the sensing performance compared with conventional fixed-position arrays, and ii)~PS provides more robust performances than PM at the cost of higher computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Topological Signal Processing Over Cell MultiComplexes Via Cross-Laplacian Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key challenges in many research fields is uncovering how different interconnected systems interact within complex networks, typically represented as multi-layer networks. Capturing the intra- and cross-layer interactions among different domains for analysis and processing calls for topological algebraic descriptors capable of localizing the homologies of different domains, at different scales, according to the learning task. Our first contribution in this paper is to introduce the Cell MultiComplexes (CMCs), which are novel topological spaces that enable the representation of higher-order interactions among interconnected cell complexes. We introduce cross-Laplacian operators as powerful algebraic descriptors of CMC spaces able to capture different topological invariants, whether global or local, at different resolutions. Using the eigenvectors of these operators as bases for the signal representation, we develop topological signal processing tools for signals defined over CMCs. Then, we focus on the signal spectral representation and on the filtering of noisy flows observed over the cross-edges between different layers of CMCs. We show that a local signal representation based on cross-Laplacians yields a better sparsity/accuracy trade-off compared to monocomplex representations, which provide overcomplete representation of local signals. Finally, we illustrate a topology learning strategy designed to infer second-order cross-cells between layers, with applications to brain networks for encoding inter-module connectivity patterns.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Breakdown and RF Performance in Field-Plated AlGaN/GaN HEMT for High-Power Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) are most suitable for harsh environments as they operate reliably under extreme conditions such as high voltages, high temperatures, radiation exposure and corrosive atmospheres. In this article, gate field-plated engineering Al0.295GaN/GaN HEMT is proposed for achieving high breakdown voltage to reliably operate in harsh environments. The Al0.295GaN/GaN heterointerface results in a 2DEG (two-dimensional electron gas) density of the order of 1013 cm-2 obtained from the self-consistent solution of Schr\"odinger and Poisson equations. The device has undergone DC and breakdown simulations which result in threshold voltage of -5.5 V, drain saturation current of 3000 mA, and breakdown voltage of 1 kV. The HEMT also shows excellent RF characteristics which include cut-off frequency (ft) of 28 GHz and maximum frequency of oscillation (fmax) of 38 GHz. The proposed gate field-plated HEMT is stable up to 40 GHz and suitable for high-voltage and high-power RF operation during harsh environment applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Product Graphs from Two-dimensional Stationary Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph learning aims to infer a network structure directly from observed data, enabling the analysis of complex dependencies in irregular domains. Traditional methods focus on scalar signals at each node, ignoring dependencies along additional dimensions such as time, configurations of the observation device, or populations. In this work, we propose a graph signal processing framework for learning graphs from two-dimensional signals, modeled as matrix graph signals generated by joint filtering along both dimensions. This formulation leverages the concept of graph stationarity across the two dimensions and leverages product graph representations to capture structured dependencies. Based on this model, we design an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently and provably recovers the optimal underlying Kronecker/Cartesian/strong product graphs. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that our approach achieves higher estimation accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Power Control in Single-User M-MIMO-OFDM System with PA Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although multiple works have proposed energy-efficient resource allocation schemes for Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) system, most approaches overlook the potential of optimizing Power Amplifier (PA) transmission power while accounting for non-linear distortion effects. Furthermore, most M-MIMO studies assume narrow-band transmission, neglecting subcarrier intermodulations at the non-linear PA for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. Therefore, this work investigates the energy-efficient power allocation for a single-user equipment (UE) M-MIMO downlink (DL) system employing OFDM with nonlinear PAs. Unlike prior works, we model wide-band transmission using a soft-limiter PA model and derive a closed-form expression for the signal-to-distortion-and-noise ratio (SNDR) under Rayleigh fading and Maximal Ratio Transmission (MRT) precoding. Next, the Energy Efficiency (EE) function is defined considering two PA architectures and a distorted OFDM signal. We then propose a low complexity root-finding algorithm to maximize EE by transmit power adjustment. Simulation results demonstrate significant EE gains over a fixed PA back-off baseline, with over $100\%$ improvement under both low and high path loss. Our findings reveal how the optimal operating point depends on the antenna count, the PA model, and the propagation conditions.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for PA Distortion-Aware M-MIMO OFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining high energy efficiency (EE) in wireless networks is crucial, particularly with the adoption of massive MIMO technology. This work introduces a resource allocation framework that jointly optimizes transmit power assigned to each user and the number of active antennas, while explicitly accounting for a nonlinear Power Amplifier (PA). We consider a downlink MU-MIMO-OFDM transmission with zero forcing (ZF) precoding, Rayleigh fading channels, and soft-limiter PAs, with both ideal and realistic PA architectures. In contrast to existing formulations, our optimization framework avoids imposing an explicit transmit power constraint, since the nonlinear distortion inherently limits the feasible operating region. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, an alternating optimization approach is adopted that, by exploiting properties of the EE function, guarantees convergence to a stationary point. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent performance gains over distortion-neglecting and power-only optimized baselines. In a scenario of a 5 km radius cell serving 60 randomly distributed users, the median EE gains over the distortion-neglecting allocation reach 40% for ideal PAs and 20% for Class B PAs, confirming high impact of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Optical Link Tomography: First Field Trial and 4D Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical link tomography (OLT) is a rapidly evolving field that allows the multi-span, end-to-end visualization of optical power along fiber links in multiple dimensions from network endpoints, solely by processing signals received at coherent receivers. This paper has two objectives: (1) to report the first field trial of OLT, using a commercial transponder under standard DWDM transmission, and (2) to extend its capability to visualize across 4D (distance, time, frequency, and polarization), allowing for locating and measuring multiple QoT degradation causes, including time-varying power anomalies, spectral anomalies, and excessive polarization dependent loss. We also address a critical aspect of OLT, i.e., its need for high fiber launch power, by improving power profile signal-to-noise ratio through averaging across all available dimensions. Consequently, multiple loss anomalies in a field-deployed link are observed even at launch power lower than the system-optimal level. The applications and use cases of OLT from network commissioning to provisioning and operation for current and near-term network scenarios are also discussed.</description>

      <title>IF-D: A High-Frequency, General-Purpose Inertial Foundation Dataset for Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present IF-D, a large-scale inertial dataset designed to enable self-supervised and foundational learning for IMU time series. IF-D comprises continuous, long-duration multichannel recordings (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) sampled at 200Hz using a UM7 IMU mounted inside a 3D-printed spherical enclosure that promotes diverse, free rotations during vehicle traversal. The collection spans approximately 135 minutes of recording, yielding around 1.6 million samples across nine sensor channels. We describe the data acquisition setup, preprocessing, and calibration procedures (six-orientation accelerometer calibration, stationary gyroscope bias estimation, and ellipsoid fitting for magnetometer hard-/soft-iron correction), and provide quantitative calibration results. IF-D is designed to mitigate platform specific motion bias and expose models to both physical dynamics and typical measurement noise, thereby facilitating robust representation learning and downstream tasks such as event detection, motion mode recognition, and inertial navigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates contactless power line communications (CPLC) for underground mining by modeling power wires as long-wire antennas. A system-level framework is developed, comprising a cascade of RF and power line channels. The model accounts for multipath propagation, frequency-dependent attenuation, and Rician fading. Simulations from 1-20 GHz reveal that the length of the wire significantly affects radiation, directivity, and input impedance. The findings show that CPLC transmits electromagnetic waves without direct electrical contact, offering a robust, cost-effective solution that enhances mobility, reduces maintenance, and ensures compatibility with existing mining power infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12694v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into 5G-Advanced and future 6G networks presents a transformative opportunity for wireless connectivity, enabling agile deployment and improved LoS communications. However, the effective design and optimization of these aerial networks depend critically on high-quality, empirical data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of publicly available wireless datasets collected from an airborne platform called Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform on Advanced Wireless (AERPAW). We highlight the unique challenges associated with generating reproducible aerial wireless datasets, and review the existing related works in the literature. Subsequently, for each dataset considered, we explain the hardware and software used, present the dataset format, provide representative results, and discuss how these datasets can be used to conduct additional research. The specific aerial wireless datasets presented include raw I/Q samples from a cellular network over different UAV trajectories, spectrum measurements at different altitudes, flying 4G base station (BS), a 5G-NSA Ericsson network, a LoRaWAN network, an radio frequency (RF) sensor network for source localization, wireless propagation data for various scenarios, and comparison of ray tracing and real-world propagation scenarios. References to all datasets and post-processing scripts are provided to enable full reproducibility of the results. Ultimately, we aim to guide the community toward effective dataset utilization for validating propagation models, developing machine learning algorithms, and advancing the next generation of aerial wireless systems.</description>

      <title>On Estimation of Angles of Arrival in Monostatic ISAC Without Instantaneous Transmit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the fundamental limits of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in a more realistic setting compared to previous literature when the Base Staion (BS) has only statistical CSI of the communication user rather than full CSI. We analyze a monostatic setting where the BS performs multi-target Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation while simultaneously communicating with one of the targets. We assume that the BS has statistical CSI about all AoAs, with less uncertainty in the AoA of the communication receiver. The communication receiver is assumed to have perfect CSI. Utilizing a Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB) framework to characterize the fundamental limits of sensing under minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria, we derive achievable BCRB-rate trade-off regions. Our approach introduces a number of transmission strategies that share power across sensing and communication beams over a coherence time. Our analysis reveals that beam allocation strategies leveraging the principal eigenvectors of the target-specific sensing matrices minimize individual AoA estimation errors, while strategies balancing sensing and communication directions optimize joint estimation performance at the cost of individual accuracy. We demonstrate that leveraging updated BCRB-based sensing information for the communication receiver, due to its lower channel uncertainty, enables significantly improved communication rates.</description>

      <title>Observation Matrix Design for Densifying MIMO Channel Estimation via 2D Ice Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, densifying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has attracted much attention from the communication community. Thanks to the subwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying antennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information (CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit precoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to boost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work proposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual information between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A two-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently accomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the eigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two sub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter antennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder and the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF promises to generate near-optimal observation matrices. Moreover, we further extend the 2DIF method to the popular hybrid combining systems, where a two-stage 2DIF (TS-2DIF) algorithm is developed to handle the analog combining circuits realized by phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods can achieve superior channel estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid I/O Relation Estimation Scheme for Zak-OTFS Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the delay-Doppler (DD) domain input-output (I/O) relation in Zak-OTFS modulation, which is needed for signal detection. Two approaches, namely, model-dependent and model-free approaches, can be employed for this purpose. The model-dependent approach requires explicit estimation of the physical channel parameters (path delays, Dopplers, and gains) to obtain the I/O relation. Such an explicit estimation is not required in the model-free approach, where the I/O relation can be estimated by reading off the samples in the fundamental DD period of the received pilot frame. Model-free approach has the advantage of acquiring fractional DD channels with simplicity. However, the read-off in the model-free approach provides an estimate of the effective channel only over a limited region in the DD plane but it does not provide an estimate for the region outside, and this can affect the estimation performance depending on the pulse shaping characteristics of the DD pulse shaping filter used. A poorly localized DD pulse shape leads to an increased degradation in performance. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, I/O relation estimation scheme that alleviates the above issue in the model-free approach. We achieve this by obtaining a coarse estimate of the effective channel outside the model-free estimation region using a novel model-dependent scheme and using this estimate along with the model-free estimate to obtain an improved estimate of the overall I/O relation. We devise the proposed estimation scheme for both exclusive and embedded pilot frames. Our simulation results using Vehicular-A, TDL-A and TDL-C channel models with fractional DDs show that the proposed hybrid estimation approach achieves superior performance compared to the pure model-free approach.</description>

      <title>Serial Polar Automorphism Ensemble Decoders for Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) involve challenging practical applications of error-correcting codes (ECCs), requiring extremely low failure rates on the order of $10^{-6}$ and below despite raw input bit error rates as high as 22%. These requirements call for an efficient ultra-low rate code design. In this work, we propose a novel coding scheme tailored for PUFs based on Polar codes and a low-complexity version of automorphism ensemble decoding (AED). Notably, our serial AED scheme reuses a single successive cancellation (SC) decoder across multiple decoding attempts. By introducing cascaded and recursive interleavers, we efficiently scale the number of AED candidates without requiring expensive large multiplexers. An aggressive quantization strategy of only 3 bits per message further reduces the area requirements of the underlying SC decoder. The resulting coding scheme achieves the same block error rate of $10^{-6}$ as our baseline based on Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes while requiring 1.75x fewer codeword bits to encode the same K = 312 payload bits. This reduction translates directly into 1.75x less helper data storage and, consequently, a smaller overall chip area.</description>

      <title>Metaplectic time-frequency representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</description>

      <title>Precoder Design in Multi-User FDD Systems with VQ-VAE and GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust precoding is efficiently feasible in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems by incorporating the learnt statistics of the propagation environment through a generative model. We build on previous work that successfully designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized by fewer pilots or feedback bits.</description>

      <title>SolNet: Open-source deep learning models for photovoltaic power forecasting across the globe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models have gained increasing prominence in recent years in the field of solar pho-tovoltaic (PV) forecasting. One drawback of these models is that they require a lot of high-quality data to perform well. This is often infeasible in practice, due to poor measurement infrastructure in legacy systems and the rapid build-up of new solar systems across the world. This paper proposes SolNet: a novel, general-purpose, multivariate solar power forecaster, which addresses these challenges by using a two-step forecasting pipeline which incorporates transfer learning from abundant synthetic data generated from PVGIS, before fine-tuning on observational data. Using actual production data from hundreds of sites in the Netherlands, Australia and Belgium, we show that SolNet improves forecasting performance over data-scarce settings as well as baseline models. We find transfer learning benefits to be the strongest when only limited observational data is available. At the same time we provide several guidelines and considerations for transfer learning practitioners, as our results show that weather data, seasonal patterns, amount of synthetic data and possible mis-specification in source location, can have a major impact on the results. The SolNet models created in this way are applicable for any land-based solar photovoltaic system across the planet where simulated and observed data can be combined to obtain improved forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Optimization for Near-Field Sensing with Continuous-Aperture Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) optimization framework for near-field sensing (NISE) with continuous-aperture arrays (CAPAs) is proposed. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), CAPAs emit electromagnetic (EM) probing signals through continuous source currents for target sensing, thereby exploiting the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for estimating target locations in the near-field region is developed. To evaluate the NISE performance with CAPAs, the CRB for estimating target locations is derived based on continuous transmit and receive array responses of CAPAs. Subsequently, a CRB minimization problem is formulated to optimize the continuous source current of CAPAs. This results in a non-convex, integral-based functional optimization problem. To address this challenge, the optimal structure of the source current is derived and proven to be spanned by a series of basis functions determined by the system geometry. To solve the CRB minimization problem, a low-complexity subspace manifold gradient descent (SMGD) method is proposed, leveraging the derived optimal structure of the source current. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SMGD method and further demonstrate that i)~the proposed SMGD method can effectively solve the CRB minimization problem with reduced computational complexity, and ii)~CAPA achieves a tenfold improvement in sensing performance compared to its SPDA counterpart, due to full exploitation of spatial DoFs.</description>

      <title>Limited-Resolution Hybrid Analog-Digital Precoding Design Using MIMO Detection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While fully-digital precoding achieves superior performance in massive MIMO systems, it comes with significant drawbacks in terms of computational complexity and power consumption, particularly when operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies and beyond. Hybrid analog-digital architectures address this by reducing radio frequency (RF) chains while maintaining performance in sparse multipath environments. However, most hybrid precoder designs assume ideal, infinite-resolution analog phase shifters, which cannot be implemented in real systems. Another practical constraint is the limited fronthaul capacity between the baseband processor and array, implying that each entry of the digital precoder must be picked from a finite set of quantization labels. This paper proposes novel designs for the limited-resolution analog and digital precoders by exploiting two well-known MIMO symbol detection algorithms, namely sphere decoding (SD) and expectation propagation (EP). Unlike prior works that rely on heuristic or sub-optimal designs for the low-resolution hybrid precoder, the proposed transformative MIMO detection-inspired designs are able to achieve optimal and near-optimal solutions. The main objective is to minimize the Euclidean distance between the optimal fully-digital precoder and the hybrid precoder to minimize the degradation caused by the finite resolution of the analog and digital precoders. Taking an alternating optimization approach, we first apply the SD method to find the precoders in each iteration optimally. Then, we apply the lower-complexity EP method which finds a near-optimal solution at a reduced computational cost. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is validated through extensive numerical simulations, which demonstrate that both SD-based and EP-based hybrid precoding schemes significantly outperform widely-used sub-optimal approaches.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Self-Similar User Traffic Demand Using Transformers in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the use of a transformer-based model to address the need for forecasting user traffic demand in the next generation Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. Considering a LEO satellite constellation, we present the need to forecast the demand for the satellites in-orbit to utilize dynamic beam-hopping in high granularity. We adopt a traffic dataset with second-order self-similar characteristics. Given this traffic dataset, the Fractional Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (FARIMA) model is considered a benchmark forecasting solution. However, the constrained on-board processing capabilities of LEO satellites, combined with the need to fit a new model for each input sequence due to the nature of FARIMA, motivate the investigation of alternative solutions. As an alternative, a pretrained probabilistic time series model that utilizes transformers with a Prob-Sparse self-attention mechanism is considered. The considered solution is investigated under different time granularities with varying sequence and prediction lengths. Concluding this paper, we provide extensive simulation results where the transformer-based solution achieved up to six percent better forecasting accuracy on certain traffic conditions using mean squared error as the performance indicator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To avoid the unpredictable phase deviations of the spaceborne phased array (SPA), this paper considers the over-the-air (OTA) phase calibration of the SPA for the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications, where the phase deviations of the SPA and the unknown channel are jointly estimated with multiple transmissions of the pilots. Moreover, the Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) is derived, and the optimization of beam patterns is also presented to lower the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the OTA calibration. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed OTA phase calibration algorithm as the RMSEs of the phase estimates closely approach the corresponding CRB, and the beam pattern optimization scheme is also validated for more than 4dB gain of SNR over the randomly generated beam patterns.</description>

Abstract: We consider free-space optical (FSO) communication links for the backhaul connectivity of small cells (SCs) where a UAV with an FSO apparatus can serve as a backhaul relay node. We demonstrate how such drone relay stations (DRSs) can be deployed in a high-rise urban area in order to provide FSO line-of-sight (LOS) links that are unobstructed by buildings. Also, in our solution we consider the case where solar panels are mounted on DRSs such that placing the DRS in a sunny location is prioritized, and we show the gain in terms of number of required trips to recharge the UAV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used to provide wireless connectivity to support the existing infrastructure in hot-spots or replace it in cases of destruction. UAV-enabled wireless provides several advantages in network performance due to drone small cells (DSCs) mobility despite the limited onboard energy. However, the problem of resource allocation has added complexity. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient user clustering mechanism based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) using a modified Expected-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The algorithm is intended to provide the initial user clustering and drone deployment upon which additional mechanisms can be employed to further enhance the system performance. The proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency of the system by 25% and link reliability by 18.3% compared to other baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional quaternion arrays (often referred to as "quaternion tensors") and their decompositions have recently gained increasing attention in various fields such as color and polarimetric imaging or video processing. Despite this growing interest, the theoretical development of quaternion tensors remains limited. This paper introduces a novel multilinear framework for quaternion arrays, which extends the classical tensor analysis to multidimensional quaternion data in a rigorous manner. Specifically, we propose a new definition of quaternion tensors as $\mathbb{H}\mathbb{R}$-multilinear forms, addressing the challenges posed by the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Within this framework, we establish the Tucker decomposition for quaternion tensors and develop a quaternion Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (Q-CPD). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the Q-CPD, including trivial ambiguities, complex equivalent models, and sufficient conditions for uniqueness. Additionally, we present two algorithms for computing the Q-CPD and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments. Our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for further research on quaternion tensor decompositions and offer new computational tools for practitioners working with quaternion multiway data.</description>

      <title>Authentication Security of PRF GNSS Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work derives the authentication security of pseudorandom function (PRF) GNSS ranging under multiple GNSS spoofing models, including the Security Code Estimation and Replay (SCER) spoofer. When GNSS ranging codes derive from a PRF utilizing a secret known only to the broadcaster, the spoofer cannot predict the ranging code before broadcast. Therefore, PRF ranging can be used to establish trust in the GNSS pseudoranges and the resulting receiver position, navigation, and timing (PNT) solution. I apply the methods herein to Galileo's Signal Authentication Service (SAS) utilizing the encrypted Galileo E6-C signal to compute that, at most, 400 ms of Galileo E6-C data to assert 128-bit authentication security under non-SCER models. For the SCER adversary, I predict the adversary's needed receiving radio equipment to break authentication security. One can use this work to design a PRF GNSS ranging protocol to meet useful authentication security requirements by computing the probability of missed detection.</description>
