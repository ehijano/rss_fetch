      <title>Trait-structured chemotaxis: Exploring ligand-receptor dynamics and travelling wave properties in a Keller-Segel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel trait-structured Keller-Segel model that explores the dynamics of a migrating cell population guided by chemotaxis in response to an external ligand concentration is derived and analysed. Unlike traditional Keller-Segel models, this framework introduces an explicit representation of ligand-receptor bindings on the cell membrane, where the percentage of occupied receptors constitutes the trait that influences cellular phenotype. The model posits that the cell's phenotypic state directly modulates its capacity for chemotaxis and proliferation, governed by a trade-off due to a finite energy budget: cells highly proficient in chemotaxis exhibit lower proliferation rates, while more proliferative cells show diminished chemotactic abilities. The model is derived from the principles of a biased random walk, resulting in a system of two non-local partial differential equations, describing the densities of both cells and ligands. Using a Hopf-Cole transformation, we derive an equation that characterises the distribution of cellular traits within travelling wave solutions for the total cell density, allowing us to uncover the monotonicity properties of these waves. Numerical investigations are conducted to examine the model's behaviour across various biological scenarios, providing insights into the complex interplay between chemotaxis, proliferation, and phenotypic diversity in migrating cell populations.</description>

      <title>Validating the predictions of mathematical models describing tumor growth and treatment response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in methods to interrogate tumor biology, the observational and population-based approach of classical cancer research and clinical oncology does not enable anticipation of tumor outcomes to hasten the discovery of cancer mechanisms and personalize disease management. To address these limitations, individualized cancer forecasts have been shown to predict tumor growth and therapeutic response, inform treatment optimization, and guide experimental efforts. These predictions are obtained via computer simulations of mathematical models that are constrained with data from a patient's cancer and experiments. This book chapter addresses the validation of these mathematical models to forecast tumor growth and treatment response. We start with an overview of mathematical modeling frameworks, model selection techniques, and fundamental metrics. We then describe the usual strategies employed to validate cancer forecasts in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Finally, we discuss existing barriers in validating these predictions along with potential strategies to address them.</description>
