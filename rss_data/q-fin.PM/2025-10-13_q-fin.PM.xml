      <title>Optimal annuitization with labor income under age-dependent force of mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal annuitization with labour income, where an agent aims to maximize utility from consumption and labour income under age-dependent force of mortality. Using a dynamic programming approach, we derive closed-form solutions for the value function and the optimal consumption, portfolio, and labor supply strategies. Our results show that before retirement, investment behavior increases with wealth until a threshold set by labor supply. After retirement, agents tend to consume a larger portion of their wealth. Two main factors influence optimal annuitization decisions as people get older. First, the agent's perspective (demand side); the agent's personal discount rate rises with age, reducing their desire to annuitize. Second, the insurer's perspective (supply side); insurers offer higher payout rates (mortality credits). Our model demonstrates that beyond a certain age, sharply declining survival probabilities make annuitization substantially optimal, as the powerful incentive of mortality credits outweighs the agent's high personal discount rate. Finally, post-retirement labor income serves as a direct substitute for annuitization by providing an alternative stable income source. It enhances the financial security of retirees.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Investment Performance: The p-index and Empirical Efficient Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical results have shown that firstly, with one-week holding period and reinvesting, for SSE Composite Index stocks, the highest p-ratio investment strategy produces the largest annualized rate of return; and for NYSE Composite Index stocks, all the three strategies with both one-week and one-month periods generate negative returns. Secondly, with non-reinvesting, for SSE Composite Index stocks, the highest p-ratio strategy with one-week holding period yields the largest annualized rate of return; and for NYSE Composite stocks, the one-week EEF strategy produces a medium annualized return. Thirdly, under the one-week EEF investment strategy, for NYSE Composite Index stocks, the right frontier yields a higher annualized return, but for SSE Composite Index stocks, the left frontier (stocks on the empirical efficient frontier) yields a higher annualized return than the right frontier. Fourthly, for NYSE Composite Index stocks, there is a positive linear relationship between monthly return and the p-index, but no such relationship is evident for SSE Composite Index stocks. Fifthly, for NYSE Composite Index stocks, the traditional five-factor model performs poorly, and adding the p-index as a sixth factor provides incremental information.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the mean-field game theory with the classical idea of binomial tree framework, pioneered by Sharpe and Cox, Ross &amp; Rubinstein, to solve the equilibrium price formation problem for the stock. For agents with exponential utilities and recursive utilities of exponential type, we prove the existence of a unique mean-field equilibrium and derive an explicit formula for equilibrium transition probabilities of the stock price by restricting its trajectories onto a binomial tree. The agents are subject to stochastic terminal liabilities and incremental endowments, both of which are dependent on unhedgeable common and idiosyncratic factors, in addition to the stock price path. Finally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the qualitative effects of these components on the equilibrium price distribution.</description>
