      <title>Adaptive Distributed Observer-based Model Predictive Control for Multi-agent Formation with Resilience to Communication Link Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to address the nonlinear multi-agent formation tracking control problem with input constraints and unknown communication faults, a novel adaptive distributed observer-based distributed model predictive control method is developed in this paper. This design employs adaptive distributed observers in local control systems to estimate the leader's state, dynamics, and relative positioning with respect to the leader. Utilizing the estimated data as local references, the original formation tracking control problem can be decomposed into several fully localized tracking control problems, which can be efficiently solved by the local predictive controller. Through the incorporation of adaptive distributed observers, this proposed design not only enhances the resilience of distributed formation tracking against communication faults but also simplifies the distributed model predictive control formulation.</description>

      <title>LiFePO4 Battery SOC Estimation under OCV-SOC Curve Error Based onAdaptive Multi-Model Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiFePO4 batteries are widely used in electric vehicles and energy storage systems due to long cycle life and high safety performance. However, the OCV-SOC curve (OSC) of these batteries features a long plateau region, making state of charge (SOC) estimation highly sensitive to OSC error, which arises due to aging and temperature. To address this, we propose an SOC estimation method that accounts for error in OSC. First, we establish battery equivalent circuit model (ECM) and introduce a parameters identification algorithm based on adaptive recursive least squares. Next, we derive the relationship between the innovation's cross-correlation matrix (CCM)/ auto-correlation matrix (ACM) of the Kalman filter and the OSC error. We then develop an adaptive multi-model Kalman filter (AMMKF), which dynamically adjusts the measurement model parameters of each filter based on the sign of the OSC error. By assigning a probability to each filter according to its predicted voltage distribution function, the optimal filter is selected. The proposed method is tested under various OSC error types and operating conditions. Results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and robustness, with an RMSE of less than 3\%, which is more than 10\% lower than the estimation error of traditional method.</description>

      <title>Carbon Neutral Greenhouse: Economic Model Predictive Control Framework for Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing education in modeling, optimal control, and nonlinear Model Predictive Control~(MPC) through a practical greenhouse climate control model. The framework includes a detailed mathematical model of lettuce growth and greenhouse, which are influenced by real-time external weather conditions obtained via an application programming interface~(API). Using this data, the MPC-based approach dynamically adjusts greenhouse conditions, optimizing plant growth and energy consumption and minimizing the social cost of CO\textsubscript{2}. The presented results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in balancing energy use with crop yield and reducing CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, contributing to economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. Besides optimizing lettuce production, the framework also provides a valuable resource for making control systems education more engaging and effective. The main aim is to provide students with a hands-on platform to understand the principles of modeling, the complexity of MPC and the trade-offs between profitability and sustainability in agricultural systems. This framework provides students with hands-on experience, helping them to understand the control theory better, connecting it to the practical implementation, and developing their problem-solving skills.

      <title>Topology Optimization in Three-Phase C-Core SRMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimized combination of rotor and stator teeth in a three-phase switched reluctance motor featuring a connected C-core topology to attain a larger winding area and, thus, a higher electrical loading capability, leading to a higher torque density. The general formulation is discussed. Additionally, the shorter flux path within the design leads to a reduced core loss. The finite element method is employed in the design and field analysis. A comparison with a conventional motor shows the superiority of the proposed configuration. The optimized design is prototyped and tested. Both static and dynamic torques are extracted. A good correlation between simulation and experimental results is observed.</description>

      <title>Satellite Safe Margin: Fast solutions for Conjunction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of debris in orbit has increased significantly over the years. With the recent growth of interest in space exploration, conjunction assessment has become a central issue. One important metric to evaluate conjunction risk is the miss distance. However, this metric does not intrinsically take into account uncertainty distributions. Some work has been developed to consider the uncertainty associated with the position of the orbiting objects, in particular, to know if these uncertainty distributions overlap (e.g., ellipsoids when considering Gaussian distributions). With this work, we present fast solutions to not only check if the ellipsoids overlap but to compute the distance between them, which we call margin. We present two fast solution methods for two different paradigms: when the best-known data from both objects can be centralized (e.g., debris-satellite conjunctions) and when the most precise covariances cannot be shared (conjunctions of satellites owned by different operators). Our methods are both accurate and fast, being able to process 15,000 conjunctions per minute with the centralized solution and approximately 490 conjunctions per minute with the distributed solution.</description>

      <title>Two-Phase Switched Reluctance Motors: Optimal Magnet Placement and Drive System for Torque Density and Efficiency Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing new motors with high torque density, which is crucial for applications ranging from electric vehicles to robotics. We propose a double-teeth C-core switched reluctance motor with hybrid excitation, integrating permanent magnets and a novel drive technique to enhance motor torque density. We explore three magnet placement configurations to maximize torque. A common challenge with most self-starting methods used in two-phase SRMs is the generation of negative torque, which reduces the motor's torque density. Our adopted self-starting method minimizes negative torque, and we introduce a new drive strategy to control the switching on and off, effectively eliminating negative torque. Additionally, magnetic equivalent circuits are developed for the analytical design and theoretical analysis of all configurations. The SRMs under study are prototyped and tested, and their performances are evaluated in terms of torque-angle characteristics, current, and voltage. Both experimental and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the PM-assisted SRMs in enhancing torque density and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Multiphysics Analysis and Investigation of Soft Magnetics Effect on IPMSM: Case Study Dynamometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Mo-tors (IPMSMs) are taken into attention in the industry owing to their advantages. Moreover, in many cases, per-forming static tests is not enough, and investigating electric machines under dynamic conditions is necessary. Accordingly, by employing a dynamometer system, the dynamic behavior of the electric machine under test is investigated. Among the dynamometers, the best is the Alternating (AC) dynamometer because the basic dynamometers cannot take loads with high complexity. So, in the following study, two IPMSM with V-type and Delta-type rotor configurations are designed and suggested to employ in AC dynamometer. Any non-ideality in the electric machines of AC dynamometers, electrically and mechanically, causes errors in the measurement of the motor under test. Electrically and mechanically, the behavior of a system significantly depends on the used soft magnetics besides its physical and magnetic configuration. Accordingly, by performing a Multiphysics analysis and using the FEM tool to change the soft magnetics in the rotor and stator core, comparing the electric motors' behavior in the AC dynamometer is investigated under the same operating conditions electrically and mechanically. Finally, which soft magnetics is more satisfactory for the AC dynamometer can be seen.</description>

      <title>Continuous Evolution of Digital Twins using the DarTwin Notation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite best efforts, various challenges remain in the creation and maintenance processes of digital twins (DTs). One of those primary challenges is the constant, continuous and omnipresent evolution of systems, their user's needs and their environment, demanding the adaptation of the developed DT systems. DTs are developed for a specific purpose, which generally entails the monitoring, analysis, simulation or optimization of a specific aspect of an actual system, referred to as the actual twin (AT). As such, when the twin system changes, that is either the AT itself changes, or the scope/purpose of a DT is modified, the DTs usually evolve in close synchronicity with the AT. As DTs are software systems, the best practices or methodologies for software evolution can be leveraged. This paper tackles the challenge of maintaining a (set of) DT(s) throughout the evolution of the user's requirements and priorities and tries to understand how this evolution takes place. In doing so, we provide two contributions: (i) we develop DarTwin, a visual notation form that enables reasoning on a twin system, its purposes, properties and implementation, and (ii) we introduce a set of architectural transformations that describe the evolution of DT systems. The development of these transformations is driven and illustrated by the evolution and transformations of a family home's DT, whose purpose is expanded, changed and re-prioritized throughout its ongoing lifecycle. Additionally, we evaluate the transformations on a lab-scale gantry crane's DT.</description>

      <title>On Cost-Sensitive Distributionally Robust Log-Optimal Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a novel \emph{cost-sensitive} distributionally robust log-optimal portfolio problem, where the investor faces \emph{ambiguous} return distributions, and a general convex transaction cost model is incorporated. The uncertainty in the return distribution is quantified using the \emph{Wasserstein} metric, which captures distributional ambiguity. We establish conditions that ensure robustly survivable trades for all distributions in the Wasserstein ball under convex transaction costs. By leveraging duality theory, we approximate the infinite-dimensional distributionally robust optimization problem with a finite convex program, enabling computational tractability for mid-sized portfolios. Empirical studies using S\&amp;P 500 data validate our theoretical framework: without transaction costs, the optimal portfolio converges to an equal-weighted allocation, while with transaction costs, the portfolio shifts slightly towards the risk-free asset, reflecting the trade-off between cost considerations and optimal allocation.</description>

      <title>Tiny Learning-Based MPC for Multirotors: Solver-Aware Learning for Efficient Embedded Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tiny aerial robots show promise for applications like environmental monitoring and search-and-rescue but face challenges in control due to their limited computing power and complex dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) can achieve agile trajectory tracking and handle constraints. Although current learning-based MPC methods, such as Gaussian Process (GP) MPC, improve control performance by learning residual dynamics, they are computationally demanding, limiting their onboard application on tiny robots. This paper introduces Tiny Learning-Based Model Predictive Control (LB MPC), a novel framework for resource-constrained micro multirotor platforms. By exploiting multirotor dynamics' structure and developing an efficient solver, our approach enables high-rate control at 100 Hz on a Crazyflie 2.1 with a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller. We demonstrate a 23\% average improvement in tracking performance over existing embedded MPC methods, achieving the first onboard implementation of learning-based MPC on a tiny multirotor (53 g).</description>

      <title>Intelligent Angle Map-based Beam Alignment for RIS-aided mmWave Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been widely used to enhance the performance of millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, making beam alignment more challenging. To ensure efficient communication, this paper proposes a novel intelligent angle map-based beam alignment scheme for both general user equipments (UEs) and RIS-aided UEs simultaneously in a fast and effective way. Specifically, we construct a beam alignment architecture that utilizes only angular information. To obtain the angle information, the currently hottest seq2seq model - the Transformer - is introduced to offline learn the relationship between UE geographic location and the corresponding optimal beam direction. Based on the powerful machine learning model, the location-angle mapping function, i.e., the angle map, can be built. As long as the location information of UEs is available, the angle map can make the acquisition of beam alignment angles effortless. In the simulation, we utilize a ray-tracing-based dataset to verify the performance of the proposed scheme. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can achieve high-precision beam alignment and remarkable system performance without any beam scanning.</description>

      <title>Redundant Observer-Based Tracking Control for Object Extraction Using a Cable Connected UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new disturbance observer based control scheme is developed for a quadrotor under the concurrent disturbances from a lightweight elastic tether cable and a lumped vertical disturbance. This elastic tether is unusual as it creates a disturbance proportional to the multicopter's translational movement. This paper takes an observer-based approach to estimate the stiffness coefficient of the cable and uses the system model to update the estimates of the external forces, which are then compensated in the control action. Given that the tethered cable force affects both horizontal channels of the quadrotor and is also coupled with the vertical channel, the proposed disturbance observer is constructed to exploit the redundant measurements across all three channels to jointly estimate the cable stiffness and the vertical disturbance. A pseudo-inverse method is used to determine the observer gain functions, such that the estimation of the two quantities is decoupled and stable. Compared to standard disturbance observers which assume nearly constant disturbances, the proposed approach can quickly adjust its total force estimate as the tethered quadrotor changes its position or tautness of the tether. This is applied to two experiments - a tracking performance test where the multicopter moves under a constant tether strain, and an object extraction test. In the second test, the multicopter manipulates a nonlinear mechanism mimicking the extraction of a wedged object. In both cases, the proposed approach shows significant improvement over standard Disturbance Observer and Extended State Observer approaches. A video summary of the experiments can be found at https://youtu.be/9gKr13WTj-k.</description>

      <title>Scalable Kernel Inverse Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Optimization (IO) is a framework for learning the unknown objective function of an expert decision-maker from a past dataset. In this paper, we extend the hypothesis class of IO objective functions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), thereby enhancing feature representation to an infinite-dimensional space. We demonstrate that a variant of the representer theorem holds for a specific training loss, allowing the reformulation of the problem as a finite-dimensional convex optimization program. To address scalability issues commonly associated with kernel methods, we propose the Sequential Selection Optimization (SSO) algorithm to efficiently train the proposed Kernel Inverse Optimization (KIO) model. Finally, we validate the generalization capabilities of the proposed KIO model and the effectiveness of the SSO algorithm through learning-from-demonstration tasks on the MuJoCo benchmark.</description>

      <title>Efficient Satellite-Ground Interconnection Design for Low-orbit Mega-Constellation Topology</title>

Abstract: The low-orbit mega-constellation network (LMCN) is an important part of the space-air-ground integrated network system. An effective satellite-ground interconnection design can result in a stable constellation topology for LMCNs. A naive solution is accessing the satellite with the longest remaining service time (LRST), which is widely used in previous designs. The Coordinated Satellite-Ground Interconnecting (CSGI), the state-of-the-art algorithm, coordinates the establishment of ground-satellite links (GSLs). Compared with existing solutions, it reduces latency by 19% and jitter by 70% on average. However, CSGI only supports the scenario where terminals access only one satellite and cannot fully utilize the multi-access capabilities of terminals. Additionally, CSGI's high computational complexity poses deployment challenges. To overcome these problems, we propose the Classification-based Longest Remaining Service Time (C-LRST) algorithm. C-LRST supports the actual scenario with multi-access capabilities. It adds optional paths during routing with low computational complexity, improving end-to-end communications quality. We conduct our 1000s simulation from Brazil to Lithuania on the open-source platform Hypatia. Experiment results show that compared with CSGI, C-LRST reduces the latency and increases the throughput by approximately 60% and 40%, respectively. In addition, C-LRST's GSL switching number is 14, whereas CSGI is 23. C-LRST has better link stability than CSGI.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Learning of Two-Stage Beamformers in Passive IRS-Assisted Systems with Inexact Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an efficient data-driven and model-free unsupervised learning algorithm for achieving fully passive intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-assisted optimal short/long-term beamforming in wireless communication networks. The proposed algorithm is based on a zeroth-order stochastic gradient ascent methodology, suitable for tackling two-stage stochastic nonconvex optimization problems with continuous uncertainty and unknown (or "black-box") terms present in the objective function, via the utilization of inexact evaluation oracles. We showcase that the algorithm can operate under realistic and general assumptions, and establish its convergence rate close to some stationary point of the associated two-stage (i.e., short/long-term) problem, particularly in cases where the second-stage (i.e., short-term) beamforming problem (e.g., transmit precoding) is solved inexactly using an arbitrary (inexact) oracle. The proposed algorithm is applicable on a wide variety of IRS-assisted optimal beamforming settings, while also being able to operate without (cascaded) channel model assumptions or knowledge of channel statistics, and over arbitrary IRS physical configurations; thus, no active sensing capability at the IRS(s) is needed. Our algorithm is numerically demonstrated to be very effective in a range of experiments pertaining to a well-studied MISO downlink model, including scenarios demanding physical IRS tuning (e.g., directly through varactor capacitances), even in large-scale regimes.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Data-Driven Control of Continuous-Time Linear Time-Invariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven stabilization method for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems with theoretical guarantees and no need for signal derivatives. The framework, based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), is illustrated in the state-feedback and single-input single-output output-feedback scenarios. Similar to discrete-time approaches, we rely solely on input and state/output measurements. To avoid differentiation, we employ low-pass filters of the available signals that, rather than approximating the derivatives, reconstruct a non-minimal realization of the plant. With access to the filter states and their derivatives, we can solve LMIs derived from sample batches of the available signals to compute a dynamic controller that stabilizes the plant. The effectiveness of the framework is showcased through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Sagittal Planar Ankle-Foot Prosthesis with Powered Plantarflexion and Socket Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powered ankle-foot prostheses can often reduce the energy cost of walking by assisting with push-off. However, focus on providing mechanical work may lead to ignoring or exacerbating common issues with chronic pain, irritation, pressure ulcer development, and eventual osteoarthritis in persons with amputation. This paper presents the design and validation of a novel transtibial prosthesis informed by predictive biomechanical simulations of gait which minimize a combination of user effort and interaction loading from the prosthesis socket. From these findings, the device was designed with a non-biomimetic anterior-posterior translation degree of freedom with a 10 cm range of motion which is primarily position-controlled to change the alignment of the prosthetic foot with the residual limb. The system is both mobile and tethered, with the batteries, actuators, and majority of electronics located in a small backpack. Mechanical loads are transmitted through cables to the prosthesis, minimizing the distal mass carriage required. We measured torque and force sensing accuracy, open loop actuator performance, closed loop torque and position control bandwidth, and torque and position tracking error during walking. The system is capable of producing up to 160 N-m of plantarflexion torque and 394 N of AP translation force with a closed loop control bandwidth of about 7 Hz in both degrees of freedom. Torque tracking during walking was accurate within about 10 N-m but position tracking was substantially affected by phase lag, possibly due to cable slack in the bidirectional mechanism. The prototype was capable of replicating our simulated prosthesis dynamics during gait and offers useful insights into the advantages and the practical considerations of using predictive biomechanical simulation as a design tool for wearable robots.</description>

Abstract: By means of the linear parameter-varying (LPV) Fundamental Lemma, we derive novel data-driven predictive control (DPC) methods for LPV systems. In particular, we present output-feedback and state-feedback-based LPV-DPC methods with terminal ingredients, which guarantee exponential stability and recursive feasibility. We provide methods for the data-based computation of these terminal ingredients. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the application and implementation aspects of the LPV-DPC schemes is given, including application for nonlinear systems and handling noisy data. We compare and demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in a detailed simulation example involving a nonlinear unbalanced disc system.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Design Optimization of a Linear Motor with Halbach Array for Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents analytical modeling and design of a high-acceleration, low-vibration slotless double-sided linear motor with an arbitrary Halbach array for lithography machines used in semiconductor manufacturing technology. Amperian current and magnetic charge models of permanent magnets are integrated into a hybrid approach to develop comprehensive analytical modeling. Unlike conventional methods that treat magnets as sources for Poisson's equations, the solution is reduced to Laplace's equations, with magnets being represented as boundary conditions. The magnetic fields and potentials within distinct regions, along with machine quantities such as shear stress, force-angle characteristics, torque profile, attraction force, misalignment force, and back-EMF, are derived, comprehensively analyzed, and compared to FEM results for accuracy validation. In addition, two models based on Poisson's equations in terms of scalar and vector potentials are derived, compared, and analyzed. Finally, design optimization and sensitivity analysis of a linear stage for lithography applications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the topic of condition monitoring of wind turbine blades and presents a learning-based approach to fault detection. The proposed scheme utilises Principal Components Analysis and Autoencoders to derive data-driven models from root-bending moment and other measurements. The models are trained with real data obtained from a fault-free wind turbine, and then validated on data corresponding to unknown health condition. Online test statistics, employing static thresholds and Generalized Likelihood Ratio tests, are used on residual signals generated by discrepancies between the actual and reconstructed measurements to detect deviations from nominal operation. The efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated using real-life data collected from wind turbines experiencing blade faults.</description>

      <title>Parametric Digital Twins for Preserving Historic Buildings: A Case Study at L\"ofstad Castle in \"Osterg\"otland, Sweden</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study showcases the digitalization of L\"ofstad Castle in Sweden to contribute to preserving its heritage values. The castle and its collections are deteriorating due to an inappropriate indoor climate. To address this, thirteen cloud-connected sensor boxes, equipped with 84 sensors, were installed throughout the main building, from the basement to the attic, to continuously monitor various indoor environmental parameters. The collected extensive multi-parametric data form the basis for creating a parametric digital twin of the building. The digital twin and detailed data analytics offer a deeper understanding of indoor climate and guide the adoption of appropriate heating and ventilation strategies. The results revealed the need to address high humidity problems in the basement and on the ground floor, such as installing vapor barriers. Opportunities for adopting energy-efficient heating and ventilation strategies on the upper floors were also highlighted. The digitalization solution and findings are not only applicable to L\"ofstad Castle but also provide valuable guidance for the conservation of other historic buildings facing similar challenges.</description>

      <title>Effective Finite Time Stability Control for Human-Machine Shared Vehicle Following System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of intelligent connected vehicle technology, human-machine shared control has gained popularity in vehicle following due to its effectiveness in driver assistance. However, traditional vehicle following systems struggle to maintain stability when driver reaction time fluctuates, as these variations require different levels of system intervention. To address this issue, the proposed human-machine shared vehicle following assistance system (HM-VFAS) integrates driver outputs under various states with the assistance system. The system employs an intelligent driver model that accounts for reaction time delays, simulating time-varying driver outputs. A control authority allocation strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the level of intervention based on real-time driver state assessment. To handle instability from driver authority switching, the proposed solution includes a two-layer adaptive finite time sliding mode controller (A-FTSMC). The first layer is an integral sliding mode adaptive controller that ensures robustness by compensating for uncertainties in the driver output. The second layer is a fast non-singular terminal sliding mode controller designed to accelerate convergence for rapid stabilization. Using real driver videos as inputs, the performance of the HM-VFAS was evaluated. Results show that the proposed control strategy maintains a safe distance under time-varying driver states, with the actual acceleration error relative to the target acceleration maintained within 0.5m/s~2 and the maximum acceleration error reduced by 1.2m/s~2. Compared to traditional controllers, the A-FTSMC controller offers faster convergence and less vibration, reducing the stabilization time by 27.3%.</description>

      <title>DiffLight: A Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion Model for Traffic Signal Control with Missing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning in traffic signal control (TSC) has been extensively researched and yielded notable achievements. However, most existing works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding intersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In real-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions or data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the needs of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional diffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting. Specifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data imputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the learning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under data-missing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five datasets with various data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data. The code of DiffLight is released at https://github.com/lokol5579/DiffLight-release.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Equivalence in Digital Twins of Intelligent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A digital twin contains up-to-date data-driven models of the physical world being studied and can use simulation to optimise the physical world. However, the analysis made by the digital twin is valid and reliable only when the model is equivalent to the physical world. Maintaining such an equivalent model is challenging, especially when the physical systems being modelled are intelligent and autonomous. The paper focuses in particular on digital twin models of intelligent systems where the systems are knowledge-aware but with limited capability. The digital twin improves the acting of the physical system at a meta-level by accumulating more knowledge in the simulated environment. The modelling of such an intelligent physical system requires replicating the knowledge-awareness capability in the virtual space. Novel equivalence maintaining techniques are needed, especially in synchronising the knowledge between the model and the physical system. This paper proposes the notion of knowledge equivalence and an equivalence maintaining approach by knowledge comparison and updates. A quantitative analysis of the proposed approach confirms that compared to state equivalence, knowledge equivalence maintenance can tolerate deviation thus reducing unnecessary updates and achieve more Pareto efficient solutions for the trade-off between update overhead and simulation reliability.</description>

      <title>An NMPC-ECBF Framework for Dynamic Motion Planning and Execution in vision-based Human-Robot Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06923v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enable safe and effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) in smart manufacturing, seamless integration of sensing, cognition, and prediction into the robot controller is critical for real-time awareness, response, and communication inside a heterogeneous environment (robots, humans, and equipment). The proposed approach takes advantage of the prediction capabilities of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to execute a safe path planning based on feedback from a vision system. In order to satisfy the requirement of real-time path planning, an embedded solver based on a penalty method is applied. However, due to tight sampling times NMPC solutions are approximate, and hence the safety of the system cannot be guaranteed. To address this we formulate a novel safety-critical paradigm with an exponential control barrier function (ECBF) used as a safety filter. We also design a simple human-robot collaboration scenario using V-REP to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller and investigate whether integrating human pose prediction can help with safe and efficient collaboration. The robot uses OptiTrack cameras for perception and dynamically generates collision-free trajectories to the predicted target interactive position. Results for a number of different configurations confirm the efficiency of the proposed motion planning and execution framework. It yields a 19.8% reduction in execution time for the HRC task considered.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Attention and Cognitive Control Costs Using Temporally-Layered Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current reinforcement learning framework focuses exclusively on performance, often at the expense of efficiency. In contrast, biological control achieves remarkable performance while also optimizing computational energy expenditure and decision frequency. We propose a Decision Bounded Markov Decision Process (DB-MDP), that constrains the number of decisions and computational energy available to agents in reinforcement learning environments. Our experiments demonstrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms struggle within this framework, leading to either failure or suboptimal performance. To address this, we introduce a biologically-inspired, Temporally Layered Architecture (TLA), enabling agents to manage computational costs through two layers with distinct time scales and energy requirements. TLA achieves optimal performance in decision-bounded environments and in continuous control environments, it matches state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a fraction of the compute cost. Compared to current reinforcement learning algorithms that solely prioritize performance, our approach significantly lowers computational energy expenditure while maintaining performance. These findings establish a benchmark and pave the way for future research on energy and time-aware control.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the concept of homotopic trajectory planning has emerged as a novel solution to navigation in large-scale obstacle environments for swarm robotics, offering a wide ranging of applications. However, it lacks an efficient homotopic path planning method in large-scale obstacle environments. This paper introduces Tube RRT*, an innovative homotopic path planning method that builds upon and improves the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. Tube RRT* is specifically designed to generate homotopic paths, strategically considering gap volume and path length to mitigate swarm congestion and ensure agile navigation. Through comprehensive simulations and experiments, the effectiveness of Tube RRT* is validated.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Model Predictive Control via Trust-Region Quasi-Newton Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17983</link>

Abstract: Model predictive control can optimally deal with nonlinear systems under consideration of constraints. The control performance depends on the model accuracy and the prediction horizon. Recent advances propose to use reinforcement learning applied to a parameterized model predictive controller to recover the optimal control performance even if an imperfect model or short prediction horizons are used. However, common reinforcement learning algorithms rely on first order updates, which only have a linear convergence rate and hence need an excessive amount of dynamic data. Higher order updates are typically intractable if the policy is approximated with neural networks due to the large number of parameters.
  In this work, we use a parameterized model predictive controller as policy, and leverage the small amount of necessary parameters to propose a trust-region constrained Quasi-Newton training algorithm for policy optimization with a superlinear convergence rate. We show that the required second order derivative information can be calculated by the solution of a linear system of equations. A simulation study illustrates that the proposed training algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of data efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>

Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified mad-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>
