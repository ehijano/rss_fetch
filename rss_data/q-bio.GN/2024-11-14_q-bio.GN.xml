      <title>LoRA-BERT: a Natural Language Processing Model for Robust and Accurate Prediction of long non-coding RNAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve as crucial regulators in numerous biological processes. Although they share sequence similarities with messenger RNAs (mRNAs), lncRNAs perform entirely different roles, providing new avenues for biological research. The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has greatly advanced the detection and identification of lncRNA transcripts and deep learning-based approaches have been introduced to classify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These advanced methods have significantly enhanced the efficiency of identifying lncRNAs. However, many of these methods are devoid of robustness and accuracy due to the extended length of the sequences involved. To tackle this issue, we have introduced a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation called LoRA-BERT. LoRA-BERT is designed to capture the importance of nucleotide-level information during sequence classification, leading to more robust and satisfactory outcomes. In a comprehensive comparison with commonly used sequence prediction tools, we have demonstrated that LoRA-BERT outperforms them in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our results indicate that, when utilizing the transformer model, LoRA-BERT achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting both lncRNAs and mRNAs for human and mouse species. Through the utilization of LoRA-BERT, we acquire valuable insights into the traits of lncRNAs and mRNAs, offering the potential to aid in the comprehension and detection of diseases linked to lncRNAs in humans.</description>

      <title>Modeling variable guide efficiency in pooled CRISPR screens with ContrastiveVI+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic screens mediated via CRISPR-Cas9 combined with high-content readouts have emerged as powerful tools for biological discovery. However, computational analyses of these screens come with additional challenges beyond those found with standard scRNA-seq analyses. For example, perturbation-induced variations of interest may be subtle and masked by other dominant source of variation shared with controls, and variable guide efficiency results in some cells not undergoing genetic perturbation despite expressing a guide RNA. While a number of methods have been developed to address the former problem by explicitly disentangling perturbation-induced variations from those shared with controls, less attention has been paid to the latter problem of noisy perturbation labels. To address this issue, here we propose ContrastiveVI+, a generative modeling framework that both disentangles perturbation-induced from non-perturbation-related variations while also inferring whether cells truly underwent genomic edits. Applied to three large-scale Perturb-seq datasets, we find that ContrastiveVI+ better recovers known perturbation-induced variations compared to previous methods while successfully identifying cells that escaped the functional consequences of guide RNA expression. An open-source implementation of our model is available at \url{https://github.com/insitro/contrastive_vi_plus}.</description>

      <title>CGRclust: Chaos Game Representation for Twin Contrastive Clustering of Unlabelled DNA Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes CGRclust, a novel combination of unsupervised twin contrastive clustering of Chaos Game Representations (CGR) of DNA sequences, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To the best of our knowledge, CGRclust is the first method to use unsupervised learning for image classification (herein applied to two-dimensional CGR images) for clustering datasets of DNA sequences. CGRclust overcomes the limitations of traditional sequence classification methods by leveraging unsupervised twin contrastive learning to detect distinctive sequence patterns, without requiring DNA sequence alignment or biological/taxonomic labels. CGRclust accurately clustered twenty-five diverse datasets, with sequence lengths ranging from 664 bp to 100 kbp, including mitochondrial genomes of fish, fungi, and protists, as well as viral whole genome assemblies and synthetic DNA sequences. Compared with three recent clustering methods for DNA sequences (DeLUCS, iDeLUCS, and MeShClust v3.0.), CGRclust is the only method that surpasses 81.70% accuracy across all four taxonomic levels tested for mitochondrial DNA genomes of fish. Moreover, CGRclust also consistently demonstrates superior performance across all the viral genomic datasets. The high clustering accuracy of CGRclust on these twenty-five datasets, which vary significantly in terms of sequence length, number of genomes, number of clusters, and level of taxonomy, demonstrates its robustness, scalability, and versatility.</description>

      <title>SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler for rapid estimation of mutational histories of unusual lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 usually evolves at a relatively constant rate over time. Occasionally, however, lineages arise with higher-than-expected numbers of mutations given the date of sampling. Such lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, including selection pressures imposed by evolution during a chronic infection or exposure to mutation-inducing drugs like molnupiravir. We have developed an open-source web-based application (SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler; https://eringill.shinyapps.io/covid_mutation_distributions) that compares a list of user-submitted lineage-defining mutations or a FASTA file containing a single genome (from which lineage-defining mutations are calculated) with established mutation distributions including those observed during (1) the first nine months of the pandemic, (2) during the global transmission of Omicron, (3) during the chronic infection of immunocompromised patients, and (4) during zoonotic spillover from humans to deer. The application calculates the most likely distribution for the user's mutation list and displays log likelihoods for all distributions. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio of the user's list is calculated to determine whether there is evidence of exposure to a mutation-inducing drug such as molnupiravir and indicates whether the list contains mutations in the proofreading domain of nsp14 which could lead to a higher-than-expected mutation rate in the lineage. This tool will be useful for public health and researchers seeking to rapidly infer evolutionary histories of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which can aid risk assessment and public health responses.</description>
