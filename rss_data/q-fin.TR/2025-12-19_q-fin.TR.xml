      <title>Hidden Order in Trades Predicts the Size of Price Moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets exhibit an apparent paradox: while directional price movements remain largely unpredictable--consistent with weak-form efficiency--the magnitude of price changes displays systematic structure. Here we demonstrate that real-time order-flow entropy, computed from a 15-state Markov transition matrix at second resolution, predicts the magnitude of intraday returns without providing directional information. Analysis of 38.5 million SPY trades over 36 trading days reveals that conditioning on entropy below the 5th percentile increases subsequent 5-minute absolute returns by a factor of 2.89 (t = 12.41, p &lt; 0.0001), while directional accuracy remains at 45.0%--statistically indistinguishable from chance (p = 0.12). This decoupling arises from a fundamental symmetry: entropy is invariant under sign permutation, detecting the presence of informed trading without revealing its direction. Walk-forward validation across five non-overlapping test periods confirms out-of-sample predictability, and label-permutation placebo tests yield z = 14.4 against the null. These findings suggest that information-theoretic measures may serve as volatility state variables in market microstructure, though the limited sample (36 days, single instrument) requires extended validation.</description>

      <title>The Red Queen's Trap: Limits of Deep Evolution in High-Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) is frequently hypothesized to be the "Holy Grail" of algorithmic trading, promising systems that adapt autonomously to non-stationary market regimes. This paper presents a rigorous post-mortem analysis of "Galaxy Empire," a hybrid framework coupling LSTM/Transformer-based perception with a genetic "Time-is-Life" survival mechanism. Deploying a population of 500 autonomous agents in a high-frequency cryptocurrency environment, we observed a catastrophic divergence between training metrics (Validation APY $&gt;300\%$) and live performance (Capital Decay $&gt;70\%$). We deconstruct this failure through a multi-disciplinary lens, identifying three critical failure modes: the overfitting of \textit{Aleatoric Uncertainty} in low-entropy time-series, the \textit{Survivor Bias} inherent in evolutionary selection under high variance, and the mathematical impossibility of overcoming microstructure friction without order-flow data. Our findings provide empirical evidence that increasing model complexity in the absence of information asymmetry exacerbates systemic fragility.</description>

      <title>Design of a Decentralized Fixed-Income Lending Automated Market Maker Protocol Supporting Arbitrary Maturities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In decentralized finance (DeFi), designing fixed-income lending automated market makers (AMMs) is extremely challenging due to time-related complexities. Moreover, existing protocols only support single-maturity lending. Building upon the BondMM protocol, this paper argues that its mathematical invariants are sufficiently elegant to be generalized to arbitrary maturities. This paper thus propose an improved design, BondMM-A, which supports lending activities of any maturity. By integrating fixed-income instruments of varying maturities into a single smart contract, BondMM-A offers users and liquidity providers (LPs) greater operational freedom and capital efficiency. Experimental results show that BondMM-A performs excellently in terms of interest rate stability and financial robustness.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic and finite-sample distributions of one- and two-sample empirical relative entropy, with application to change-point detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy, as a divergence metric between two distributions, can be used for offline change-point detection and extends classical methods that mainly rely on moment-based discrepancies. To build a statistical test suitable for this context, we study the distribution of empirical relative entropy and derive several types of approximations: concentration inequalities for finite samples, asymptotic distributions, and Berry-Esseen bounds in a pre-asymptotic regime. For the latter, we introduce a new approach to obtain Berry-Esseen inequalities for nonlinear functions of sum statistics under some convexity assumptions. Our theoretical contributions cover both one- and two-sample empirical relative entropies. We then detail a change-point detection procedure built on relative entropy and compare it, through extensive simulations, with classical methods based on moments or on information criteria. Finally, we illustrate its practical relevance on two real datasets involving temperature series and volatility of stock indices.</description>
