      <title>Line-of-Sight Probability in Macrocells: Framework, Statistical Models, and Parametrization from Massive Real World Datasets in the USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of line-of-sight (LOS) probability is crucial for wireless channel description and coverage planning. The presence of a LOS impacts other channel characteristics such as pathloss, fading depth, delay- and angular spread, etc.. Existing models, although useful, are based on very limited datasets. In this paper, we establish a framework to produce high accuracy LOS models from geospatial data in different environments, and apply it to create a LOS model for macrocells, using datasets of the United States (US) on a nationalscale, using more than 13, 000 locations of real-world macrocells. Based on this we create a new, fully parameterized model that better describes macrocell deployments in the US than the 3GPP model. We furthermore demonstrate that for improved accuracy the LOS probability should be modeled on a per cell basis, and the model parameters treated as random variables; we provide a full description and parameterization of this novel approach and by simulations show that it better predicts the inter-cell interference at the cell-edge than an average-based model.</description>

      <title>State-of-charge estimation of lithium-ion batteries using a tree seed and genetic algorithm-optimized generalized mixture minimum error entropy-based square root cubature Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cubature Kalman filter based on minimum error entropy (MEE-CKF) offers accurate and robust performance in state of charge (SOC) estimation. However, due to the inflexibility of the minimum error entropy (MEE), this algorithm demonstrates limited robustness when confronted with more complex noise environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a generalized mixture minimum error entropy-based (GMMEE) square-root cubature Kalman filter (GMMEE-SRCKF). The square-root algorithm ensures improved numerical stability and avoids covariance degeneration, while the GMMEE criterion with two flexible kernels adapts effectively to non-Gaussian noise. Moreover, a hybrid tree seed and genetic algorithm (TSGA) is introduced to optimize the kernel parameters automatically. Experimental results confirm that the TSGA-optimized GMMEE-SRCKF outperforms existing robust filters, achieving the root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 0.5%.</description>

      <title>Generative MIMO Beam Map Construction for Location Recovery and Beam Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has greatly advanced data-driven channel modeling and resource optimization in wireless communication systems. However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.</description>

      <title>Movable Intelligent Surface-Enabled Wireless Communications: Static Phase Shifts with Mechanical Reconfigurability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent surfaces that reshape electromagnetic waves are regarded as disruptive technologies for wireless networks. However, existing designs sit at two costly extremes: dynamic reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer fine beam control but require dense cabling, continuous power consumption, and substantial signaling overhead, whereas low-cost static surfaces require no control lines or electronics but are limited to a single beam pattern. This disparity leaves a practical gap for quasi-static environments, such as industrial Internet-of-things and smart agriculture scenarios, where channels are stable with user demands changing only occasionally or periodically, and neither extreme is sufficiently economical or flexible. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel movable intelligent surface (MIS) architecture, whose beam patterns are switched not by electronic phase tuning but by mechanically sliding a small, pre-phased secondary metasurface layer across a larger, likewise static primary layer. We develop an MIS signal model that characterizes the interaction between static phase elements with dynamic geometry via binary selection matrices. Based on this model, we formulate a new type of optimization problems that jointly design static phase shifts and the overlapping position selection of MS2 (equal to beam pattern scheduling). Efficient algorithms based on the penalty method, block coordinate descent, and Riemannian manifold optimization are proposed to tackle these mixed-integer non-convex problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIS architecture substantially narrows the performance gap between single-layer static surfaces and dynamic RISs, providing a practical and flexible solution for quasi-static wireless applications.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution ISAC Receivers: An MCMC-Based Gridless Sparse Bayesian Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is crucial for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), where the safety-critical demand for high-accuracy sensing creates a trade-off between precision and complexity for conventional methods. To address this, we propose a novel gridless sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for joint super-resolution multi-target detection and high-accuracy parameter estimation with manageable computational cost. Our model treats target parameters as continuous variables to bypass the grid limitations of conventional approaches. This SBL formulation, however, transforms the estimation task into a challenging high-dimensional inference problem, which we address by developing an enhanced gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Our method integrates mini-batch sampling and the Adam optimizer to ensure computational efficiency and rapid convergence. Finally, we validate the framework's robustness in strong clutter and provide a theoretical benchmark by deriving the corresponding Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound. Simulation results demonstrate remarkable super-resolution capabilities, successfully resolving multiple targets separated by merely 50% of the Rayleigh limit in range, 17% in velocity, and 52% in angle. At a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 dB, the algorithm achieves a multi-target detection probability exceeding 90% while concurrently delivering ultra-high accuracy, with root mean square error of 0.07 m, 0.024 m/s, and 0.015 degree for range, velocity, and angle, respectively. This robust performance, demonstrated against strong clutter, showcases its suitability for practical ISAC-LAWNs applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Cubature Kalman Filter based on MEEF with Adaptive Cauchy Kernel for State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, with the development of multi-sensor networks, the distributed cubature Kalman filter is one of the well-known existing schemes for state estimation, for which the influence of the non-Gaussian noise, abnormal data, and communication burden are urgent challenges. In this paper, a distributed cubature Kalman filter based on adaptive minimum error entropy with fiducial points (AMEEF) criterion (AMEEF-DCKF) is proposed to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, firstly, in order to solve the influence of various types of non-Gaussian noise and abnormal data, the AMEEF optimization criterion is designed, in which the kernels used are Cauchy kernels with adaptive bandwidth. At the same time, the designed optimization criterion has enhanced the numerical stability and optimized the kernel bandwidth value. Next, in order to address the communication burden problem in multi-sensor networks, where a leader and a follower are distinguished, a distributed algorithm is constructed to achieve an average consensus among these sensors, called leader-follower average consensus (LFAC). Additionally, the convergence proof of the average consensus algorithm and the computational complexity analysis of the AMEEF-DCKF algorithm are also presented. Finally, through a 10-node sensor network, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in estimating the state of the power system and navigating land vehicles in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Sensor-Aided Environment Awareness for Beam Management in Beyond-5G Networks: An OpenAirInterface Experimental Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large antenna arrays and beamforming techniques are key components for exploiting the spectrum-rich FR2 bands in next-generation mobile communication networks. Given the site-specific spatio-temporal variations of the mm-wave channel, non-RF sensor inputs and environment awareness can be leveraged to greatly enhance beam management decisions, e.g. via machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the current literature lacks open platforms to gather datasets for the training of such ML techniques and to evaluate novel beam management approaches in real-time, real-world scenarios and full-stack endto-end networks. In this work, we present our SDR-based experimental platform based on OpenAirInterface and are the first to integrate popular low-cost antenna array transceivers, beam sweeping capabilities, and a highly-modular sensor framework and associated interfaces into such a full-stack experimental platform. This enables beam management experimentation in real-world, real-time scenarios and facilitates gathering datasets necessary for developing ML-based beam management protocols that incorporate environment awareness via sensor modalities.</description>

      <title>Teager-Kaiser Energy Methods For EEG Feature Extraction In Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are inherently non-linear, non-stationary, and vulnerable to noise sources, making the extraction of discriminative features a long-standing challenge. In this work, we investigate the non-linear Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) for modeling the underlying energy dynamics of EEG in three representative tasks: motor imagery, emotion recognition, and epilepsy detection. To accommodate the narrowband nature of the operator, we employ Gabor filterbanks to isolate canonical frequency bands, followed by the Energy Separation Algorithm to decompose the TKEO output into amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency components. We then derive a set of energy descriptors based on this demodulation and compare their classification performance against established signal energy and power spectrum features. TKEO features outperform the respective baselines in motor imagery and epilepsy detection, whereas they perform on par in emotion recognition. Our findings suggest that the proposed TKEO-based pipeline provides an intuitive framework for extracting EEG signal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Bayesian Transfer Learning into Particle Filter for Dual-Tracking System with Asymmetric Noise Intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Bayesian transfer learning, we develop a particle filter approach for tracking a nonlinear dynamical model in a dual-tracking system where intensities of measurement noise for both sensors are asymmetric. The densities for Bayesian transfer learning are approximated with the sum of weighted particles to improve the tracking performance of the primary sensor, which experiences a higher noise intensity compared to the source sensor. We present simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to an isolated particle filter and transfer learning applied to the unscented Kalman filter and the cubature Kalman filter. Furthermore, increasing the number of particles shows an improvement in the performance of transfer learning applied to the particle filter with a higher rate compared to the isolated particle filter. However, increasing the number of particles raises computational time per step. Moreover, the performance gain from incorporating Bayesian transfer learning is approximately linearly proportional to the absolute difference value between the noise intensities of the sensors in the dual-tracking system.</description>

      <title>MRI Super-Resolution with Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address. Additionally, we provide a collection of essential open-access resources, tools, and tutorials, available on our GitHub: https://github.com/mkhateri/Awesome-MRI-Super-Resolution.

      <title>Double-Profile Intersection (DoPIo) Ultrasound: Pointwise Shear Elasticity Estimation using Paired Confocal Displacement Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current acoustic radiation force (ARF) based methods for quantifying tissue elasticity primarily rely on shear wave propagation. However, their spatial resolution is limited by the need for spatial averaging, and their accuracy is affected by shear wave guidance, out of plane reflections, and geometric dispersion, which reduce their applicability in mechanically complex tissues. This study introduces a novel technique called Double Profile Intersection (DoPIo) ultrasound, which enables pointwise estimation of shear elastic modulus within the region of ARF excitation by leveraging the scatterer shearing rate. This rate is inferred by tracking ARF induced displacement using two tracking beams with different lateral widths. The wider beam captures scatterers located outside the ARF excitation region that begin to displace as shearing propagates. The time at which the two resulting displacement profiles intersect is mapped to shear elastic modulus using an empirically derived model based on finite element simulations. In silico, DoPIo estimated shear elastic modulus with a median error of -0.02 kPa and a median absolute deviation of 1.98 kPa in elastic materials up to 35 kPa. Experimental validation in vitro and ex vivo demonstrated that DoPIo reliably distinguished softer regions from stiffer ones, and its modulus estimates remained consistent across varying ARF push amplitudes, provided sufficient displacement estimation signal to noise ratio. DoPIo offers a feasible approach for high resolution, on axis shear elasticity estimation and holds promise as a quantitative biomarker that is independent of ARF amplitude.</description>

      <title>Is Phase Really Needed for Weakly-Supervised Dereverberation ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In unsupervised or weakly-supervised approaches for speech dereverberation, the target clean (dry) signals are considered to be unknown during training. In that context, evaluating to what extent information can be retrieved from the sole knowledge of reverberant (wet) speech becomes critical. This work investigates the role of the reverberant (wet) phase in the time-frequency domain. Based on Statistical Wave Field Theory, we show that late reverberation perturbs phase components with white, uniformly distributed noise, except at low frequencies. Consequently, the wet phase carries limited useful information and is not essential for weakly supervised dereverberation. To validate this finding, we train dereverberation models under a recent weak supervision framework and demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved by excluding the reverberant phase from the loss function.</description>

      <title>Background on real and complex elliptically symmetric distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter presents a short overview of real elliptically symmetric (RES) distributions, complemented by circular complex elliptically symmetric (C-CES) and noncircular CES (NC-CES) distributions as complex representations of RES distributions. These distributions are both an extension of the multivariate Gaussian distribution and a multivariate extension of univariate symmetric distributions. They are equivalently defined through their characteristic functions and their stochastic representations, which naturally follow from the spherically symmetric distributions after affine transformations. Particular attention is paid to the absolutely continuous case and to the subclass of compound Gaussian distributions. Results related to moments, affine transformations, marginal and conditional distributions, and summation stability are also presented. Some well-known instances of RES distributions are provided with their main properties. Finally, the estimation of the symmetry center and scatter matrix is briefly discussed through the sample mean (SM), sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimate, maximum estimate (ML), $M$-estimators, and Tyler's $M$-estimators. Particular attention will be paid to the asymptotic Gaussianity of the $M$-estimators of the scatter matrix. To conclude, some hints about the Slepian-Bangs formula are provided.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic MSE-Optimality of Parametric Bayesian Channel Estimation in mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean square error (MSE)-optimal estimator is known to be the conditional mean estimator (CME). This paper introduces a parametric channel estimation technique based on Bayesian estimation. This technique uses the estimated channel parameters to parameterize the well-known LMMSE channel estimator. We first derive an asymptotic CME formulation that holds for a wide range of priors on the channel parameters. Based on this, we show that parametric Bayesian channel estimation is MSE-optimal for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or long coherence intervals, i.e., many noisy observations provided within one coherence interval. Numerical simulations validate the derived formulations.</description>

      <title>Distributed MIMO Positioning: Fundamental Limit Analysis and User Tracking Framework Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the 3D positioning capabilities in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy. In addition, the PEB-aware AP management strategy is shown to maintain robust tracking performance while significantly reducing the number of concurrently active APs, thus lowering the overall system overhead.</description>

      <title>3-20 GHz Wideband Tightly-Coupled Dual-Polarized Vivaldi Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very wideband apertures are needed in positioning, sensing, spectrum monitoring, and modern spread spectrum, e.g., frequency hopping systems. Vivaldi antennas are one of the prominent choices for the aforementioned systems due to their natural wideband characteristics. Furthermore, tightly-coupled antenna arrays have been researched in the recent years to extend the lower band edge of compact arrays by taking advantage of the strong mutual coupling between the elements especially with dipole elements, but not with dual-polarized Vivaldi antennas. This paper presents a novel tightly-coupled dual-polarized antipodal Vivaldi antenna (TC-AVA) with -6 dB impedance bandwidth of 3 to 20 GHz. The tight coupling by overlapping the Vivaldi leaves is shown to extend the lower band edge from 3.75 to 3 GHz and 2.75 GHz, an improvement of 20% to 25% for both polarizations, compared with an isolated antipodal Vivaldi element.</description>

      <title>UplinkNet: Practical Commercial 5G Standalone (SA) Uplink Throughput Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While 5G New Radio (NR) networks offer significant uplink throughput improvements, these gains are primarily realized when User Equipment (UE) connects to high-frequency millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. The growing demand for uplink-intensive applications, such as real-time UHD 4K/8K video streaming and Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR) content, highlights the need for accurate uplink throughput prediction to optimize user Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we introduce UplinkNet, a compact neural network designed to predict future uplink throughput using past throughput and RF parameters available through the Android API. With a model size limited to approximately 4,000 parameters, UplinkNet is suitable for IoT and low-power devices. The network was trained on real-world drive test data from commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in Tokyo, Japan, and Bangkok, Thailand, across various mobility conditions. To ensure practical implementation, the model uses only Android API data and was evaluated on unseen data against other models. Results show that UplinkNet achieves an average prediction accuracy of 98.9% and an RMSE of 5.22 Mbps, outperforming all other models while maintaining a compact size and low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of 5G FR2 (mmWave) Downlink 256QAM on Commercial 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 5G New Radio (NR) standard introduces new frequency bands allocated in Frequency Range 2 (FR2) to support enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) in congested environments and enables new use cases such as Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC). The 3GPP introduced 256QAM support for FR2 frequency bands to further enhance downlink capacity. However, sustaining 256QAM on FR2 in practical environments is challenging due to strong path loss and susceptibility to distortion. While 256QAM can improve theoretical throughput by 33%, compared to 64QAM, and is widely adopted in FR1, its real-world impact when utilized in FR2 is questionable, given the significant path loss and distortions experienced in the FR2 range. Additionally, using higher modulation correlates to higher BLER, increased instability, and retransmission. Moreover, 256QAM also utilizes a different MCS table defining the modulation and code rate at different Channel Quality Indexes (CQI), affecting the UE's link adaptation behavior. This paper investigates the real-world performance of 256QAM utilization on FR2 bands in two countries, across three RAN manufacturers, and in both NSA (EN-DC) and SA (NR-DC) configurations, under various scenarios, including open-air plazas, city centers, footbridges, train station platforms, and stationary environments. The results show that 256QAM provides a reasonable throughput gain when stationary but marginal improvements when there is UE mobility while increasing the probability of NACK responses, increasing BLER, and the number of retransmissions. Finally, MATLAB simulations are run to validate the findings as well as explore the effect of the recently introduced 1024QAM on FR2.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic evaluation of the information processing capacity in reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is becoming increasingly important because of its short training time. The squared error normalized by the target output is called the information processing capacity (IPC) and is used to evaluate the performance of an RC system. Since RC aims to learn the relationship between input and output time series, we should evaluate the IPC for infinitely long data rather than the IPC for finite-length data. However, a method for estimating it has not been established. We evaluated the IPC for infinitely long data using the asymptotic expansion of the IPC and weighted least-squares fitting. Then, we showed the validity of our method by numerical simulations. This work makes the performance evaluation of RC more evident.</description>

      <title>Sionna RT: Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sionna is an open-source, GPU-accelerated library that, as of version 0.14, incorporates a ray tracer, Sionna RT, for simulating radio wave propagation. A unique feature of Sionna RT is differentiability, enabling the calculation of gradients for the channel impulse responses (CIRs), radio maps, and other related metrics with respect to system and environmental parameters, such as material properties, antenna patterns, and array geometries. The release of Sionna 1.0 provides a complete overhaul of the ray tracer, significantly improving its speed, memory efficiency, and extensibility. This document details the algorithms employed by Sionna RT to simulate radio wave propagation efficiently, while also addressing their current limitations. Given that the computation of CIRs and radio maps requires distinct algorithms, these are detailed in separate sections. For CIRs, Sionna RT integrates shooting and bouncing of rays (SBR) with the image method and uses a hashing-based mechanism to efficiently eliminate duplicate paths. Radio maps are computed using a purely SBR-based approach.</description>
