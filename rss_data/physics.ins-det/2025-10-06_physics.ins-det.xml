      <title>An active Transverse Energy Filter based on microstructured Si-PIN diodes with an angular-selective detection efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Si-PIN detectors can be microstructured to achieve angular-selective particle detection capabilities, which we call active Transverse Energy Filter (aTEF). The microstructuring consists of a honeycomb structure of deep hexagonally-shaped holes with active silicon side walls, while the bottom of the holes is made insensitive to ionizing radiation. The motivation for this kind of detector arises from the need to distinguish background electrons from signal electrons in a spectrometer of MAC-E filter type. We have demonstrated the angular-dependent detection efficiency of self-fabricated aTEF prototypes in a test setup using an angular-selective photoelectron source to illuminate the detector from various incidence angles.</description>

      <title>Development of Deep Neural Network First-Level Hardware Track Trigger for the Belle II Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB accelerator is designed to explore physics beyond the Standard Model with unprecedented luminosity. As the beam intensity increased, the experiment faced significant challenges due to higher beam-induced background, leading to a high trigger rate and placing limitations on further luminosity increases. To address this problem, we developed trigger logic for tracking using deep neural network (DNN) technology on an FPGA for the Belle II hardware trigger system, employing high-level synthesis techniques. By leveraging drift time and hit pattern information from the Central Drift Chamber and incorporating a simplified self-attention architecture, the DNN track trigger significantly improves track reconstruction performance at the hardware level. Compared to the existing neural track trigger, our implementation reduces the total track trigger rate by 37% while improving average efficiency for the signal tracks from 96% to 98% for charged tracks with transverse momentum &gt; 0.3 GeV. This upgrade ensures the long-term viability of the Belle II data acquisition system as luminosity continues to increase.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Birks' coefficient of GAGG:Ce using hard X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inorganic scintillators continue to be widely used within astrophysical X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. This is in part thanks to the development of new scintillators, such as GAGG:Ce, as well as the availability of new scintillator readout sensors such as Silicon Photomultipliers and Silicon Drift Detectors. In order to use such scintillator materials for spectrometry or polarimetry, a detailed understanding of their response is important. One parameter that can affect the scintillator performance, particularly at lower photon energies, is their Birks' coefficienct, which correlates the relative light yield to the ionization energy. While for many high-Z inorganic scintillators this effect can be ignored, for GAGG:Ce this appears to not be the case. Here we provide a measurement of the Birks' coefficient for GAGG:Ce using data from two different detectors irradiated in the 20-80 keV energy range at the LARIX-A X-ray beam in Ferrara, Italy. While the effects due to Birks' law are visible below 30 keV, they also significantly influence the performance of GAGG:Ce performance near one of the K-edges, affecting both the measured gain and the energy resolution. Here, we use beam test data to derive the Birks' coefficient from GAGG:Ce. The results indicate that for usage in hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray missions, this coefficient has a significant effect on the measurements.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wavelength Dual-Polarized Lens-Absorber-Coupled Ti/Al Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents Ti/Al bi-layer Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) based on lens-coupled spiral absorbers as the quasi-optical coupling mechanism for millimeter-wavelength radiation detection. From simulations, the lens-coupled absorbers provide a 70% lens aperture efficiency in both polarizations over an octave band with a spiral array absorber and over 10% relative bandwidth with a single spiral. We have fabricated and measured two devices with bare Ti/Al MKIDs: a 3x3 cm chip with 9 pixels to characterize the optical response at 85 GHz of the two variations of the absorber; and a large format demonstrator with 253 spiral-array pixels showing potential towards a large format millimeter-wavelength camera. We find a sensitivity of 1 mK/sqrt{Hz} and a detector yield of 95%.</description>

      <title>Compton Edge Convolutional Model and Algorithm for Energy-channel Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scintillation detectors are essential tools for radiation measurement, but calibrating them accurately can be challenging, especially when full-energy peaks are not prominent. This is common in detectors like plastic scintillators. Current methods for calibrating these detectors often require manual adjustments. To address this, we propose a new method called the convolution model. This model accurately calibrates the energy-channel relationship of the Compton edge in various detectors. We tested it with plastic scintillator BC408, NaI crystal, and LaBr$_3$ crystal. Using ${}^{137}$Cs radioactive sources, we calibrated NaI and LaBr$_3$ detectors using full-energy peaks, then applied the convolution model to fit the Compton edge. Our results show errors within 1\% when compared to full-energy peak calibration.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors for Rare Event Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The calibration of the CR39 and Makrofol Nuclear Track Detectors of the MoEDAL experiment at the CERN-LHC was performed by exposing stacks of detector foils to heavy ion beams with energies ranging from 340 MeV/nucleon to 150 GeV/nucleon. After chemical etching, the base areas and lengths of etch-pit cones were measured using automatic and manual optical microscopes. The response of the detectors, as measured by the ratio of the track-etching rate over the bulk-etching rate, was determined over a range extending from their threshold at Z/$\beta\sim7$ and $\sim50$ for CR39 and Makrofol, respectively, up to Z/$\beta\sim92$</description>

      <title>Spontaneous generation of athermal phonon bursts within bulk silicon causing excess noise, low energy background events and quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid state phonon detectors used in the search for dark matter and coherent neutrino nucleus interactions (CE$\nu$NS) require excellent energy resolution (eV-scale or below) and low backgrounds. An unknown source of phonon bursts, the low energy excess (LEE), dominates other above-threshold backgrounds and generates excess shot noise from sub-threshold bursts. In this paper, we measure these phonon bursts for 12 days after cooldown in two nearly identical 1 cm$^2$ silicon detectors that differ only in the thickness of their substrate (1 mm vs. 4 mm thick). We find that both the channel-correlated shot noise and near-threshold shared LEE relax with time since cooldown. Additionally, both the correlated shot noise and LEE rates scale linearly with substrate thickness. When combined with previous measurements of other silicon phonon detectors with different substrate geometries and mechanical support strategies, these measurements strongly suggest that the dominant source of both above and below threshold LEE is the bulk substrate. By monitoring the relation between bias power and excess phonon shot noise, we estimate that the energy scale for sub-threshold noise events is $0.68 \pm 0.38$ meV. In our final dataset, we report a world-leading energy resolution of 258.5$\pm$0.4 meV in the 1 mm thick detector. Simple calculations suggest that these silicon substrate phonon bursts are likely a significant source of quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting qubits operated in well shielded and vibration free environments.</description>

      <title>RADES axion search results with a High-Temperature Superconducting cavity in an 11.7 T magnet</title>

Abstract: We describe the results of a haloscope axion search performed with an 11.7 T dipole magnet at CERN. The search used a custom-made radio-frequency cavity coated with high-temperature superconducting tape. A set of 27 h of data at a resonant frequency of around 8.84 GHz was analysed. In the range of axion mass 36.5676 $\mu$eV to 36.5699 $\mu$eV, corresponding to a width of 554 kHz, no signal excess hinting at an axion-like particle was found. Correspondingly, in this mass range, a limit on the axion to photon coupling-strength was set in the range between g$_{a\gamma}\gtrsim$ 6.2e-13 GeV$^{-1}$ and g$_{a\gamma}\gtrsim$ 1.59e-13 GeV$^{-1}$ with a 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>AstroECP: towards more practical Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based technique that enables bulk-sample characterization of crystallographic defects (e.g. dislocations, stacking faults, low angle boundaries). Despite its potential, ECCI remains underused for quantitative defect analysis as compared to transmission electron microscope (TEM) based methods. Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy low-noise electrical measurements in a closed-cycle pulse-tube cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A shift of paradigm to obtain (sub-)Kelvin environment is currently on-going with the democratization of cryogen-free cryocoolers, boosted by their easy-to-use and continuous operation without the need of liquid helium whose cost and scarcity globally increase. Thanks to their large sample space and cooling power, they can host a superconducting magnet and are an adapted platform for quantum technologies, material science, low temperature detectors and even medical fields. The drawback is that this type of system is inherently based on gas compression that induces a certain level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, which can potentially prevent the determination of low amplitude signals or spoil their stability. In this paper we demonstrate that pulse-tube based cryocoolers can be used for electrical precision measurements, using a commercial cryomagnetic system combined with our home-made a coaxial cryoprobe. In particular, parts-per-billion level of measurement uncertainties in resistance determination, based on quantum Hall resistance standards, is achievable at the level of state-of-the-art measurements involving conventional cryostats based on liquid helium. We performed an extensive characterization of the cryomagnetic system to determine the level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, and revealed that although the magnetic field has a drastic effect on the noise level, only marginal interplays on the measurement are observed as long as the working frequencies of the instrumentation are not in the vicinity of the ones of the perturbations. The set of characterization measurements presented here are easily implementable in laboratories, which can help to determine the vibrations and electromagnetic pollution generated by any cryocooler.</description>
