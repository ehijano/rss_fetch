      <title>Dynamic Activation with Knowledge Distillation for Energy-Efficient Spiking NN Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While foundation AI models excel at tasks like classification and decision-making, their high energy consumption makes them unsuitable for energy-constrained applications. Inspired by the brain's efficiency, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a viable alternative due to their event-driven nature and compatibility with neuromorphic chips. This work introduces a novel system that combines knowledge distillation and ensemble learning to bridge the performance gap between artificial neural networks (ANNs) and SNNs. A foundation AI model acts as a teacher network, guiding smaller student SNNs organized into an ensemble, called Spiking Neural Ensemble (SNE). SNE enables the disentanglement of the teacher's knowledge, allowing each student to specialize in predicting a distinct aspect of it, while processing the same input. The core innovation of SNE is the adaptive activation of a subset of SNN models of an ensemble, leveraging knowledge-distillation, enhanced with an informed-partitioning (disentanglement) of the teacher's feature space. By dynamically activating only a subset of these student SNNs, the system balances accuracy and energy efficiency, achieving substantial energy savings with minimal accuracy loss. Moreover, SNE is significantly more efficient than the teacher network, reducing computational requirements by up to 20x with only a 2% drop in accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This disentanglement procedure achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 2.4% on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to other partitioning schemes. Finally, we comparatively analyze SNE performance under noisy conditions, demonstrating enhanced robustness compared to its ANN teacher. In summary, SNE offers a promising new direction for energy-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Position: Graph Learning Will Lose Relevance Due To Poor Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning on graphs has demonstrated promise in drug design and molecular property prediction, significant benchmarking challenges hinder its further progress and relevance. Current benchmarking practices often lack focus on transformative, real-world applications, favoring narrow domains like two-dimensional molecular graphs over broader, impactful areas such as combinatorial optimization, relational databases, or chip design. Additionally, many benchmark datasets poorly represent the underlying data, leading to inadequate abstractions and misaligned use cases. Fragmented evaluations and an excessive focus on accuracy further exacerbate these issues, incentivizing overfitting rather than fostering generalizable insights. These limitations have prevented the development of truly useful graph foundation models. This position paper calls for a paradigm shift toward more meaningful benchmarks, rigorous evaluation protocols, and stronger collaboration with domain experts to drive impactful and reliable advances in graph learning research, unlocking the potential of graph learning.</description>

      <title>Multi-Class Imbalanced Learning with Support Vector Machines via Differential Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm to handle classification tasks. However, the classical SVM is developed for binary problems with the assumption of balanced datasets. Obviously, the multi-class imbalanced classification problems are more complex. In this paper, we propose an improved SVM via Differential Evolution (i-SVM-DE) method to deal with it. An improved SVM (i-SVM) model is proposed to handle the data imbalance by combining cost sensitive technique and separation margin modification in the constraints, which formalize a parameter optimization problem. By using one-versus-one (OVO) scheme, a multi-class problem is decomposed into a number of binary subproblems. A large optimization problem is formalized through concatenating the parameters in the binary subproblems. To find the optimal model effectively and learn the support vectors for each class simultaneously, an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm is applied to solve this large optimization problem. Instead of the validation set, we propose the fitness functions to evaluate the learned model and obtain the optimal parameters in the search process of DE. A series of experiments are carried out to verify the benefits of our proposed method. The results indicate that i-SVM-DE is statistically superior by comparing with the other baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Topology Optimization using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge is designing multi-scale structures with good connectivity between cells while optimizing each cell to reach close to the theoretical performance limit. We propose a new method for direct multi-scale topology optimization using neural networks. Our approach focuses on inverse homogenization that seamlessly maintains compatibility across neighboring microstructure cells. Our approach consists of a topology neural network that optimizes the microstructure shape and distribution across the design domain as a continuous field. Each microstructure cell is optimized based on a specified elasticity tensor that also accommodates in-plane rotations. The neural network takes as input the local coordinates within a cell to represent the density distribution within a cell, as well as the global coordinates of each cell to design spatially varying microstructure cells. As such, our approach models an n-dimensional multi-scale optimization problem as a 2n-dimensional inverse homogenization problem using neural networks. During the inverse homogenization of each unit cell, we extend the boundary of each cell by scaling the input coordinates such that the boundaries of neighboring cells are combined. Inverse homogenization on the combined cell improves connectivity. We demonstrate our method through the design and optimization of graded multi-scale structures.</description>

      <title>Integrated Scheduling Model for Arrivals and Departures in Metroplex Terminal Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of the rapid expansion of civil aviation, addressing the delays and congestion phenomena in the vicinity of metroplex caused by the imbalance between air traffic flow and capacity is crucial. This paper first proposes a bi-level optimization model for the collaborative flight sequencing of arrival and departure flights in the metroplex with multiple airports, considering both the runway systems and TMA (Terminal Control Area) entry/exit fixes. Besides, the model is adaptive to various traffic scenarios. The genetic algorithm is employed to solve the proposed model. The Shanghai TMA, located in China, is used as a case study, and it includes two airports, Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The results demonstrate that the model can reduce arrival delay by 51.52%, departure delay by 18.05%, and the runway occupation time of departure flights by 23.83%. Furthermore, the model utilized in this study significantly enhances flight scheduling efficiency, providing a more efficient solution than the traditional FCFS (First Come, First Served) approach. Additionally, the algorithm employed offers further improvements over the NSGA II algorithm.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Primacy Effect in Structured State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human and animal memory for sequentially presented items is well-documented to be more accurate for those at the beginning and end of the sequence, phenomena known as the primacy and recency effects, respectively. By contrast, artificial neural network (ANN) models are typically designed with a memory that decays monotonically over time. Accordingly, ANNs are expected to show the recency effect but not the primacy effect. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: a recently developed ANN architecture, called structured state-space models, exhibits the primacy effect when trained and evaluated on a synthetic task that mirrors psychological memory experiments. Given that this model was originally designed for recovering neuronal activity patterns observed in biological brains, this result provides a novel perspective on the psychological primacy effect while also posing a non-trivial puzzle for the current theories in machine learning.</description>
