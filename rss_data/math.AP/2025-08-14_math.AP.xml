      <title>Global uniform regularity for the 3D incompressible MHD equations with slip boundary condition near a background magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper resolves the global regularity problem for the three-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations in the upper half-space with slip boundary conditions, in the presence of a background magnetic field. Motivated by geophysical applications, we consider an anisotropic MHD system with weak dissipation in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and small vertical magnetic diffusion. By exploiting the stabilizing effect induced by the background magnetic field and constructing a hierarchy of four energy functionals, we establish global-in-time uniform bounds that are independent of the viscosity in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and the vertical resistivity. A key innovation in our analysis is the development of a two-tier energy method, which couples the boundedness of conormal derivatives with the decay of tangential derivatives. These global conormal regularity estimates, together with sharp decay rates, enable us to rigorously justify the vanishing dissipation limit and derive explicit long-time convergence rates to the MHD system with vanishing dissipation in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and no vertical magnetic diffusion. In the absence of a magnetic field, the global-in-time vanishing viscosity limit for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with anisotropic dissipation remains a challenging open problem. This work reveals the mechanism by which the magnetic field enhances dissipation and stabilizes the fluid dynamics in the vanishing viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Unconditional uniqueness for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation by normal form approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in $L^\infty_tH^{1/2}_x$. Our proof is based on the method of normal form reduction (NFR), which has been employed to obtain the uniqueness in $C_tH^s_x$, $s&gt;1/2$. To overcome logarithmic divergences at the $H^{1/2}$ regularity, we exploit the $B^{0+}_{\infty,1}$ control of solutions provided by a refined Strichartz estimate. Our NFR argument consists of two stages: we first use NFR finitely many times to derive an intermediate equation in which the main cubic nonlinearity is restricted to a certain type of frequency interaction; we then apply the infinite NFR scheme to the intermediate equation. Moreover, we modify the usual NFR argument relying on continuity in time of solutions so that the uniqueness in the class $L^\infty_tH^{1/2}_x$ can be obtained directly.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of strong solution to the nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with an initial-boundary value problem of the nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system with the Landau potential in a two and three dimensions. Global existence of strong solutions with bounded and strictly positive density for this system was proven by Giorgini and Temam \cite{GT}; however, an additional smoothness assumption on the initial density was needed to prove uniqueness in \cite{GT1}. Whether uniqueness holds without this additional assumption has remained an open question. The present work solves this question and we finally establish uniqueness of the strong solution in the framework in \cite{GT}. Our method relies on some extra time weighted estimates and the Lagrangian approach.</description>

      <title>Fujita-Kato solution for the 3D compressible pressureless Navier-Stokes equations with discontinuous and large-variation density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper mainly focuses on the Cauchy problem to the 3D compressible pressureless Navier-Stokes equations arising from models of collective behavior, which can be derived by taking the high Mach number limit of the classical compressible Navier-Stokes system. We construct the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of the so-called Fujita-Kato solution to the system, provided that the initial density $\rho_0$ is discontinuous, large-variation and the initial velocity $u_0$ is in a critical functional framework. Our method relies on some time weighted estimates and the Lagrangian approach.</description>

      <title>An alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation on non-mean convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation that applies to non-mean convex domains. This condition is derived from a second-order ordinary differential equation whose solution produces a barrier that appears to be novel in the context of barrier constructions. It admits an explicit formulation and, in the setting of Hadamard manifolds, reveals a direct and transparent relationship between the geometry of the domain and the behavior of the boundary data required for solvability. The condition also extends naturally to unbounded domains. In the Euclidean case, it is not only more practical to verify but also less restrictive than the classical Jenkins - Serrin criterion, ensuring the existence of solutions in situations where that approach fail. Furthermore, unlike the Jenkins-Serrin condition, our appproach separates the geometric properties of the domain from its boundary data, providing a clearer and more manageable framework for solvability analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative version of a sharp integral inequality by Hang, Wang, and Yan for both the Poisson operator and its adjoint. Our result has the strongest possible norm and the optimal stability exponent. This stability exponent is not necessarily equal to 2, displaying the same phenomenon that Figalli and Zhang observed for the $p$-Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <title>Edge states in square lattice media and their deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge states are time-harmonic solutions of conservative wave systems which are plane wave-like parallel to and localized transverse to an interface between two bulk media. We study a class of 2D edge Hamiltonians modeling a medium which slowly interpolates between periodic bulk media via a domain wall across a "rational" line defect. We consider the cases of (1) periodic bulk media having the symmetries of a square lattice, and (2) linear deformations of such media. Our bulk Hamiltonians break time-reversal symmetry due to perturbation by a magnetic term, which opens a band gap about the band structure degeneracies of the unperturbed bulk Hamiltonian. In case (1), these are quadratic band degeneracies; in case (2), they are pairs of conical degeneracies. We demonstrate that this band gap is traversed by two distinct edge state curves, consistent with the bulk-edge correspondence principle of topological physics. Blow-ups of these curves near the bulk band degeneracies are described by effective (homogenized) edge Hamiltonians derived via multiple-scale analysis which control the bifurcation of edge states. In case (1), the bifurcation is governed by a matrix Schr\"{o}dinger operator; in case (2), it is governed by a pair of Dirac operators. We present analytical results and numerical simulations for both the full 2D edge Hamiltonian spectral problem and the spectra of effective edge Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problems for bodies of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, one of which, appearing multiple times, is free and the rest are fixed. In the case where all bodies involved are symmetric around a common axis, we provide a complete solution to this problem, without assuming any regularity. In particular, we refine Firey's classification of area measures of figures of revolution.
  In our argument, we introduce an easy way to transform mixed area measures and mixed volumes involving axially symmetric bodies, and we significantly improve Firey's estimate on the local behavior of area measures. As a secondary result, we obtain a family of Hadwiger type theorems for convex valuations that are invariant under rotations around an axis.</description>

      <title>Doubling measures and Poincar\'e inequalities for sphericalizations of metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification between the complex plane and the Riemann sphere preserves holomorphic and harmonic functions and is a classical tool. In this paper we consider a similar mapping from an unbounded metric space $X$ to a bounded space and show how it preserves $p$-harmonic functions and Poincar\'e inequalities. When $X$ is Ahlfors regular, this was shown in our earlier paper (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 474 (2019), 852-875). Here we only require the much weaker (and more natural) doubling property of the measure. Furthermore, we consider a broader class of transformed measures. The sphericalization is then applied to obtain new results for the Dirichlet boundary value problem in unbounded sets and for boundary regularity at infinity for $p$-harmonic functions. Some of these results are new also for unweighted $\mathbf{R}^n$, $n \ge 2$ and $p\ne2$.</description>

      <title>Integrated Local Energy Decay for Damped Magnetic Wave Equations on Stationary Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish local energy decay for damped magnetic wave equations on stationary, asymptotically flat space-times subject to the geometric control condition. More specifically, we allow for the addition of time-independent magnetic and scalar potentials, which negatively affect energy coercivity and may add in unwieldy spectral effects. By asserting the non-existence of eigenvalues in the lower half-plane and resonances on the real line, we are able to apply spectral theory from the work of Metcalfe, Sterbenz, and Tataru and combine with a generalization of prior work by the present author to extend the latter work and establish local energy decay, under one additional symmetry hypothesis. Namely, we assume that the damping term is the dominant principal term in the skew-adjoint part of the damped wave operator within the region where the metric perturbation from that of Minkowski space is permitted to be large. We also obtain an energy dichotomy if we do not prohibit non-zero real resonances. In order to make the structure of the argument more cohesive, we contextualize the present work within the requisite existing theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we review recent results on stability and instability in logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, with a particular emphasis on strong norms. We consider several versions of these inequalities on the Euclidean space, for the Lebesgue and the Gaussian measures, and discuss their differences in terms of moments and stability. We give new and direct proofs, as well as examples and discuss the stability of a logarithmic uncertainty principle. Although we do not cover all aspects of the topic, we hope to contribute to establishing the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize weighted modulation spaces (data space) for which the heat semigroup $e^{-tL}f$ converges pointwise to the initial data $f$ as time $t$ tends to zero. Here $L$ stands for the standard Laplacian $-\Delta $ or Hermite operator $H=-\Delta +|x|^2$ on the Euclidean space. Similar result also holds for Poisson semigroup $e^{-t\sqrt{L}}f.$ This is the first result on pointwise convergence with data in a weighted modulation spaces (which do not coincide with weighted Lebesgue spaces). We also prove that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator operates on certain modulation spaces. This may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Nystr\"{o}m Method for Scattering by a Two-layered Medium with a Rough Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02339v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with problems of scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by a two-layered medium with a non-locally perturbed boundary (called a rough boundary in this paper) in two dimensions, where a Dirichlet or impedance boundary condition is imposed on the boundary. The two-layered medium is composed of two unbounded media with different physical properties and the interface between the two media is considered to be a planar surface. We formulate the scattering problems considered as boundary value problems and prove the result of the well-posedness of each boundary value problem by utilizing the integral equation method associated with the two-layered Green function. Moreover, we develop a Nystr\"{o}m method for numerically solving the boundary value problems considered, based on the proposed integral equation formulations. We establish the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method with the convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the rough boundary. It is worth noting that in establishing the well-posedness of the boundary value problems as well as the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method, an essential role is played by the investigation of the asymptotic properties of the two-layered Green function for small and large arguments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the Nystr\"{o}m method.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and compactness with constant mean curvature in warped product manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03499v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the rigidity of rectifiable boundaries with constant distributional mean curvature in the Brendle class of warped product manifolds (which includes important models in General Relativity, like the deSitter--Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordstrom manifolds). As a corollary we characterize limits of rectifiable boundaries whose mean curvatures converge, as distributions, to a constant. The latter result is new, and requires the full strength of distributional CMC-rigidity, even when one considers smooth boundaries whose mean curvature oscillations vanish in arbitrarily strong $C^k$-norms.</description>
