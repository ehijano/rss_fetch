      <title>Splitting methods with complex coefficients for linear and nonlinear evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution is dedicated to the exploration of exponential operator splitting methods for the time integration of evolution equations. It entails the review of previous achievements as well as the depiction of novel results. The standard class of splitting methods involving real coefficients is contrasted with an alternative approach that relies on the incorporation of complex coefficients. In view of long-term computations for linear evolution equations, it is expedient to distinguish symmetric, symmetric-conjugate, and alternating-conjugate schemes. The scope of applications comprises high-order reaction-diffusion equations and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations, which are of relevance in the theories of patterns and superconductivity. Time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equations and their parabolic counterparts, which model the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates and arise in ground state computations, are formally included as special cases. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of theoretical stability conditions and global error bounds as well as the benefits of higher-order complex splitting methods in comparison with standard schemes.</description>

      <title>STLCutters.jl: A scalable geometrical framework library for unfitted finite element discretisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating partial differential equations for extensive industrial and scientific applications requires leveraging the power of modern high-performance computing. In large-scale parallel computations, the geometrical discretisation rapidly becomes a bottleneck in the simulation pipeline. Unstructured mesh generation is hardly automatic, and meshing algorithms cannot efficiently exploit distributed-memory computers. Adaptive Cartesian meshes are far more advantageous, providing cheap and scalable mesh generation, partitioning, and balancing compared to unstructured meshes. However, Cartesian meshes are not suitable for complex geometries when using standard discretisation techniques. Unfitted finite element methods are a promising solution to the abovementioned problems. Nevertheless, their application is usually constrained to implicit (level-set) geometrical representations. The extension to general geometries, e.g., provided by an STL surface mesh, requires advanced intersection algorithms. This work presents an efficient parallel implementation of all the geometric tools required, e.g., for unfitted finite element methods (in a broad sense), for explicit boundary representations. Such geometries can readily be generated using standard computer-aided design tools. The proposed geometrical workflow utilise a multilevel approach to overlapping computations, effectively eliminating bottlenecks in large-scale computations. The numerical results demonstrate perfect weak scalability over 13,000 processors and one billion cells. All these algorithms are implemented in the open-sopurce STLCutters.jl library, written in the Julia programming language. The library is designed to be used in conjunction with the Gridap.jl library provides a high-level interface to the finite element method.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard equation including time adaptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel spatial discretization for the Cahn-Hilliard equation including transport. The method is given by a mixed discretization for the two elliptic operators, with the phase field and chemical potential discretized in discontinuous Galerkin spaces, and two auxiliary flux variables discretized in a divergence-conforming space. This allows for the use of an upwind-stabilized discretization for the transport term, while still ensuring a consistent treatment of structural properties including mass conservation and energy dissipation. Further, we couple the novel spatial discretization to an adaptive time stepping method in view of the Cahn-Hilliard equation's distinct slow and fast time scale dynamics. The resulting implicit stages are solved with a robust preconditioning strategy, which is derived for our novel spatial discretization based on an existing one for continuous Galerkin based discretizations. Our overall scheme's accuracy, robustness, efficient time adaptivity as well as structure preservation and stability with respect to advection dominated scenarios are demonstrated in a series of numerical tests.</description>

      <title>A unified fourth-order Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook lattice Boltzmann model for high-dimensional linear hyperbolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first develop a unified Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook lattice Boltzmann (BGK-LB) model for the $d$($d\geq 1$)-dimensional linear hyperbolic equation (L-HE), where the natural moments and the D$d$Q$(2d^2+1)$ [($2d^2+1$) discrete velocities in $d$-dimensional space] lattice structure are considered. Subsequently, at the acoustic scaling, we conduct an accuracy analysis on the developed BGK-LB model by the direct Taylor expansion (DTE) method, and present the second- and third-order moments of the equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs) to ensure that the BGK-LB model can be fourth-order consistent with the L-HE. And on this basis, when considering the Dirichlet boundary condition, the fourth-order full-way and half-way boundary schemes are proposed to approximate the unknown distribution functions to ensure that the BGK-LB model can be overall fourth-order accurate. Thereafter, based on the kinetic entropy theory, we derive the conditions that the fourth-order moments of the EDFs should satisfy to ensure the microscopic entropy stability of the BGK-LB model. In addition, with the aid of the von Neumann stability analysis, we also discuss the $L^2$ stability of the BGK-LB model and numerically plot the stability regions. In particular, from a numerical perspective, we find that the region of microscopic entropy stability is identical to that of $L^2$ stability. Finally, we carry out some numerical experiments to test the accuracy and stability of the BGK-LB model, and the numerical results are in agreement with our theoretical analysis. In addition, we compare the developed full-way and half-way boundary schemes for the Dirichlet boundary condition, which shows that the full-way boundary scheme is more stable.</description>

      <title>Subspace method based on neural networks for eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of machine learning, numerical discretization methods based on deep neural networks have been widely used in many fields, especially in solving high-dimensional problems where traditional methods face bottlenecks. However, for low-dimensional problems, existing machine learning methods are not as accurate and efficient as traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a subspace method based on neural networks for eigenvalue problems with high accuracy and low cost. Our basic idea is to use neural network based basis functions to span a subspace, then calculate the parameters of the neural network based basis functions through appropriate training, and finally calculate the Galerkin projection of the eigenvalue problem onto the subspace and obtain an approximate solution. In addition, we reduce the dimension of the subspace by applying some dimensionality reduction technique, which can improve the accuracy of the approximate solution in further. Numerical experiments show that we can obtain approximate eigenvalues with accuracy of $10^{-11}$ but with less then 400 epochs, which is significantly superior to other existing neural network based methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving linear systems $Ax=b$, $A$ and $b$ are given, but the measurements $b$ often contain corruptions. Inspired by recent work on the quantile-randomized Kaczmarz method, we propose an acceleration of the randomized Kaczmarz method using quantile information. We show that the proposed acceleration converges faster than the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm. In addition, we show that our proposed approach can be used in conjunction with the quantile-randomized Kaczamrz algorithm, without adding additional computational complexity, to produce both a fast and robust iterative method for solving large, sparsely corrupted linear systems. Our extensive experimental results support the use of the revised algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Finite Difference Method for Total Variation Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive finite difference scheme in order to numerically solve total variation type problems for image processing tasks. The automatic generation of the grid relies on indicators derived from a local estimation of the primal-dual gap error. This process leads in general to a non-uniform grid for which we introduce an adjusted finite difference method. Further we quantify the impact of the grid refinement on the respective discrete total variation. In particular, it turns out that a finer discretization may lead to a higher value of the discrete total variation for a given function. To compute a numerical solution on non-uniform grids we derive a semi-smooth Newton algorithm in 2D for scalar and vector-valued total variation minimization. We present numerical experiments for image denoising and the estimation of motion in image sequences to demonstrate the applicability of our adaptive scheme.</description>

      <title>Robust time-DG finite and virtual elements for the time-dependent advection--diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a stability and convergence analysis for the fully discrete scheme obtained by combining a finite or virtual element spatial discretization with the upwind-discontinuous Galerkin time-stepping applied to the time-dependent advection-diffusion equation. A space-time streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin term is used to stabilize the method. More precisely, we show that the method is inf-sup stable with constant independent of the diffusion coefficient, which ensures the robustness of the method in the convection- and diffusion-dominated regimes. Moreover, we prove optimal convergence rates in both regimes for the error in the energy norm. An important feature of the presented analysis is the control in the full~$L^2(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ norm without the need of introducing an artificial reaction term in the model. We finally present some numerical experiments in~$(3 + 1)$-dimensions that validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On SCD Semismooth$^*$ Newton methods for the efficient minimization of Tikhonov functionals with non-smooth and non-convex penalties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the efficient numerical minimization of Tikhonov functionals with nonlinear operators and non-smooth and non-convex penalty terms, which appear for example in variational regularization. For this, we consider a new class of SCD semismooth$^*$ Newton methods, which are based on a novel concept of graphical derivatives, and exhibit locally superlinear convergence. We present a detailed description of these methods, and provide explicit algorithms in the case of sparsity and total-variation penalty terms. The numerical performance of these methods is then illustrated on a number of tomographic imaging problems.</description>

      <title>Physically Recurrent Neural Networks for Computational Homogenization of Composite Materials with Microscale Debonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of composite materials in engineering applications has accelerated the demand for computational methods to accurately predict their complex behavior. Multiscale modeling based on computational homogenization is a potentially powerful approach for this purpose, but its widespread adoption is prevented by its excessive computational costs. A popular approach to address this computational bottleneck is using surrogate models, which have been used to successfully predict a wide range of constitutive behaviors. However, applications involving microscale damage and fracture remain largely unexplored. This work aims to extend a recent surrogate modeling approach, the Physically Recurrent Neural Network (PRNN), to include the effect of debonding at the fiber-matrix interface while capturing path-dependent behavior. The core idea of the PRNN is to implement the exact material models from the micromodel into one of the layers of the network. In this work, additional material points with a cohesive zone model are integrated within the network, along with the bulk points associated to the fibers and/or matrix. The limitations of the existing architecture are discussed and taken into account for the development of novel architectures that better represent the stress homogenization procedure. In the proposed layout, the history variables of cohesive points act as extra latent features that help determine the local strains of bulk points. Different architectures are evaluated starting with small training datasets. To maximize the predictive accuracy and extrapolation capabilities of the network, various configurations of bulk and cohesive points are explored, along with different training dataset types and sizes.</description>

      <title>modOpt: A modular development environment and library for optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in computing hardware and modeling software have given rise to new applications for numerical optimization. These new applications occasionally uncover bottlenecks in existing optimization algorithms and necessitate further specialization of the algorithms. However, such specialization requires expert knowledge of the underlying mathematical theory and the software implementation of existing algorithms. To address this challenge, we present modOpt, an open-source software framework that facilitates the construction of optimization algorithms from modules. The modular environment provided by modOpt enables developers to tailor an existing algorithm for a new application by only altering the relevant modules. modOpt is designed as a platform to support students and beginner developers in quickly learning and developing their own algorithms. With that aim, the entirety of the framework is written in Python, and it is well-documented, well-tested, and hosted open-source on GitHub. Several additional features are embedded into the framework to assist both beginner and advanced developers. In addition to providing stock modules, the framework also includes fully transparent implementations of pedagogical optimization algorithms in Python. To facilitate testing and benchmarking of new algorithms, the framework features built-in visualization and recording capabilities, interfaces to modeling frameworks such as OpenMDAO and CSDL, interfaces to general-purpose optimization algorithms such as SNOPT and SLSQP, an interface to the CUTEst test problem set, etc. In this paper, we present the underlying software architecture of modOpt, review its various features, discuss several educational and performance-oriented algorithms within modOpt, and present numerical studies illustrating its unique benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework, treating Lipschitz domains in Riemannian manifolds, that provides conditions guaranteeing the existence of norming sets and generalized local polynomial reproduction - a powerful tool used in the analysis of various mesh-free methods and a mesh-free method in its own right. As a key application, we prove the existence of smooth local polynomial reproductions on compact subsets of algebraic manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Lipschitz boundary. These results are then applied to derive new findings on the existence, stability, regularity, locality, and approximation properties of shape functions for a coordinate-free moving least squares approximation method on algebraic manifolds, which operates directly on point clouds without requiring tangent plane approximations.</description>

      <title>Linear cost and exponentially convergent approximation of Gaussian Mat\'ern processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational cost for inference and prediction of statistical models based on Gaussian processes with Mat\'ern covariance functions scales cubicly with the number of observations, limiting their applicability to large data sets. The cost can be reduced in certain special cases, but there are currently no generally applicable exact methods with linear cost. Several approximate methods have been introduced to reduce the cost, but most of these lack theoretical guarantees for the accuracy. We consider Gaussian processes on bounded intervals with Mat\'ern covariance functions and for the first time develop a generally applicable method with linear cost and with a covariance error that decreases exponentially fast in the order $m$ of the proposed approximation. The method is based on an optimal rational approximation of the spectral density and results in an approximation that can be represented as a sum of $m$ independent Gaussian Markov processes, which facilitates easy usage in general software for statistical inference, enabling its efficient implementation in general statistical inference software packages. Besides the theoretical justifications, we demonstrate the accuracy empirically through carefully designed simulation studies which show that the method outperforms all state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of accuracy for a fixed computational cost in statistical tasks such as Gaussian process regression.</description>

      <title>Fast-forwarding quantum algorithms for linear dissipative differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish improved complexity estimates of quantum algorithms for linear dissipative ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and show that the time dependence can be fast-forwarded to be sub-linear. Specifically, we show that a quantum algorithm based on truncated Dyson series can prepare history states of dissipative ODEs up to time $T$ with cost $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log(T) (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, which is an exponential speedup over the best previous result. For final state preparation at time $T$, we show that its complexity is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T} (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, achieving a polynomial speedup in $T$. We also analyze the complexity of simpler lower-order quantum algorithms, such as the forward Euler method and the trapezoidal rule, and find that even lower-order methods can still achieve $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ cost with respect to time $T$ for preparing final states of dissipative ODEs. As applications, we show that quantum algorithms can simulate dissipative non-Hermitian quantum dynamics and heat process with fast-forwarded complexity sub-linear in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a tamed theta Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme for superlinearly growing neutral McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential delay equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent $H\in(1/2,1)$. The analytical properties including uniqueness and existence, boundedness of moment and propagation of chaos are investigated. Moreover, the convergence rate of the numerical scheme is established.</description>

      <title>Data-Augmented Predictive Deep Neural Network: Enhancing the extrapolation capabilities of non-intrusive surrogate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerically solving a large parametric nonlinear dynamical system is challenging due to its high complexity and the high computational costs. In recent years, machine-learning-aided surrogates are being actively researched. However, many methods fail in accurately generalizing in the entire time interval $[0, T]$, when the training data is available only in a training time interval $[0, T_0]$, with $T_0&lt;T$.
  To improve the extrapolation capabilities of the surrogate models in the entire time domain, we propose a new deep learning framework, where kernel dynamic mode decomposition (KDMD) is employed to evolve the dynamics of the latent space generated by the encoder part of a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). After adding the KDMD-decoder-extrapolated data into the original data set, we train the CAE along with a feed-forward deep neural network using the augmented data. The trained network can predict future states outside the training time interval at any out-of-training parameter samples. The proposed method is tested on two numerical examples: a FitzHugh-Nagumo model and a model of incompressible flow past a cylinder. Numerical results show accurate and fast prediction performance in both the time and the parameter domain.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomial approximation and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition in chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08074v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is a data-driven tool for forecasting and model reduction of dynamics, which has been extensively taken up in the physical sciences. While the method is conceptually simple, in deterministic chaos it is unclear what its properties are or even what it converges to. In particular, it is not clear how EDMD's least-squares approximation treats the classes of differentiable functions on which chaotic systems act.
  We develop for the first time a general, rigorous theory of EDMD on the simplest examples of chaotic maps: analytic expanding maps of the circle. To do this, we prove a new, basic approximation result in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC) and apply methods from transfer operator theory. We show that in the infinite-data limit, the least-squares projection error is exponentially small for trigonometric polynomial observable dictionaries. As a result, we show that forecasts and Koopman spectral data produced using EDMD in this setting converge to the physically meaningful limits, exponentially fast with respect to the size of the dictionary. This demonstrates that with only a relatively small polynomial dictionary, EDMD can be very effective, even when the sampling measure is not uniform. Furthermore, our OPUC result suggests that data-based least-squares projection may be a very effective approximation strategy more generally.</description>

      <title>Diagonal and normal with Toeplitz-block splitting iteration method for space fractional coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with repulsive nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By applying the linearly implicit conservative difference scheme proposed in [D.-L. Wang, A.-G. Xiao, W. Yang. J. Comput. Phys. 2014;272:670-681], the system of repulsive space fractional coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations leads to a sequence of linear systems with complex symmetric and Toeplitz-plus-diagonal structure. In this paper, we propose the diagonal and normal with Toeplitz-block splitting iteration method to solve the above linear systems. The new iteration method is proved to converge unconditionally, and the optimal iteration parameter is deducted. Naturally, this new iteration method leads to a diagonal and normal with circulant-block preconditioner which can be executed efficiently by fast algorithms. In theory, we provide sharp bounds for the eigenvalues of the discrete fractional Laplacian and its circulant approximation, and further analysis indicates that the spectral distribution of the preconditioned system matrix is tight. Numerical experiments show that the new preconditioner can significantly improve the computational efficiency of the Krylov subspace iteration methods. Moreover, the behavior of the corresponding preconditioned GMRES method exhibits a linear dependence on the space mesh size, which weakens as the fractional order parameter decreases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the pure biharmonic equation and a biharmonic singular perturbation problem, a residual-based error estimator is introduced which applies to many existing nonconforming finite elements. The error estimator involves the local best-approximation error of the finite element function by piecewise polynomial functions of the degree determining the expected approximation order, which need not coincide with the maximal polynomial degree of the element, for example if bubble functions are used. The error estimator is shown to be reliable and locally efficient up to this polynomial best-approximation error and oscillations of the right-hand side.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of discontinuous solutions of the semilinear wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-frequency recovered fully discrete low-regularity integrator is constructed to approximate rough and possibly discontinuous solutions of the semilinear wave equation. The proposed method, with high-frequency recovery techniques, can capture the discontinuities of the solutions correctly without spurious oscillations and approximate rough and discontinuous solutions with a higher convergence rate than pre-existing methods. Rigorous analysis is presented for the convergence rates of the proposed method in approximating solutions such that $(u,\partial_{t}u)\in C([0,T];H^{\gamma}\times H^{\gamma-1})$ for $\gamma\in(0,1]$. For discontinuous solutions of bounded variation in one dimension (which allow jump discontinuities), the proposed method is proved to have almost first-order convergence under the step size condition $\tau \sim N^{-1}$, where $\tau$ and $N$ denote the time step size and the number of Fourier terms in the space discretization, respectively. Numerical examples are presented in both one and two dimensions to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method in improving the accuracy in approximating rough and discontinuous solutions of the semilinear wave equation. The numerical results are consistent with the theoretical results and show the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Discretization of fractional fully nonlinear equations by powers of discrete Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study discretizations of fractional fully nonlinear equations by powers of discrete Laplacians. Our problems are parabolic and of order $\sigma\in(0,2)$ since they involve fractional Laplace operators $(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}$. They arise e.g. in control and game theory as dynamic programming equations -- HJB and Isaacs equation -- and solutions are non-smooth in general and should be interpreted as viscosity solutions. Our approximations are realized as finite-difference quadrature approximations and are 2nd order accurate for all values of $\sigma$. The accuracy of previous approximations of fractional fully nonlinear equations depend on $\sigma$ and are worse when $\sigma$ is close to $2$. We show that the schemes are monotone, consistent, $L^\infty$-stable, and convergent using a priori estimates, viscosity solutions theory, and the method of half-relaxed limits. We also prove a second order error bound for smooth solutions and present many numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Finite element schemes with tangential motion for fourth order geometric curve evolutions in arbitrary codimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce novel finite element schemes for curve diffusion and elastic flow in arbitrary codimension. The schemes are based on a variational form of a system that includes a specifically chosen tangential motion. We derive optimal $L^2$- and $H^1$-error bounds for continuous-in-time semidiscrete finite element approximations that use piecewise linear elements. In addition, we consider fully discrete schemes and, in the case of curve diffusion, prove unconditional stability for it. Finally, we present several numerical simulations, including some convergence experiments that confirm the derived error bounds. The presented simulations suggest that the tangential motion leads to equidistribution in practice.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Riemannian gradient method for the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional in a rotating frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the numerical approximation of ground states of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates. This problem requires the minimization of the Gross-Pitaevskii energy $E$ on a Hilbert manifold $\mathbb{S}$. To find a corresponding minimizer $u$, we use a generalized Riemannian gradient method that is based on the concept of Sobolev gradients in combination with an adaptively changing metric on the manifold. By a suitable choice of the metric, global energy dissipation for the arising gradient method can be proved. The energy dissipation property in turn implies global convergence to the density $|u|^2$ of a critical point $u$ of $E$ on $\mathbb{S}$. Furthermore, we present a precise characterization of the local convergence rates in a neighborhood of each ground state $u$ and how these rates depend on the first spectral gap of $E^{\prime\prime}(u)$ restricted to the $L^2$-orthogonal complement of $u$. With this we establish the first convergence results for a Riemannian gradient method to minimize the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional in a rotating frame. At the same, we refine previous results obtained in the case without rotation. The major complication in our new analysis is the missing isolation of minimizers, which are at most unique up to complex phase shifts. For that, we introduce an auxiliary iteration in the tangent space $T_{\mathrm{i} u} \mathbb{S}$ and apply the Ostrowski theorem to characterize the asymptotic convergence rates through a weighted eigenvalue problem. Afterwards, we link the auxiliary iteration to the original Riemannian gradient method and bound the spectrum of the weighted eigenvalue problem to obtain quantitative convergence rates. Our findings are validated in numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study monotone finite difference approximations for a broad class of reaction-diffusion problems, incorporating general symmetric L\'evy operators. By employing an adaptive time-stepping discretization, we derive the discrete Fujita critical exponent for these problems. Additionally, under general consistency assumptions, we establish the convergence of discrete blow-up times to their continuous counterparts. As complementary results, we also present the asymptotic-in-time behavior of discrete heat-type equations as well as an extensive analysis of discrete eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Randomized Iterative Solver as Iterative Refinement: A Simple Fix Towards Backward Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative sketching and sketch-and-precondition are well-established randomized algorithms for solving large-scale, over-determined linear least-squares problems. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective that interprets Iterative Sketching and Sketching-and-Precondition as forms of Iterative Refinement. We also examine the numerical stability of two distinct refinement strategies, iterative refinement and recursive refinement, which progressively improve the accuracy of a sketched linear solver. Building on this insight, we propose a novel algorithm, Sketched Iterative and Recursive Refinement (SIRR), which combines both refinement methods. SIRR demonstrates a \emph{four order of magnitude improvement} in backward error compared to iterative sketching, achieved simply by reorganizing the computational order, ensuring that the computed solution exactly solves a modified least-squares system where the coefficient matrix deviates only slightly from the original matrix. To the best of our knowledge, \emph{SIRR is the first asymptotically fast, single-stage randomized least-squares solver that achieves both forward and backward stability}.</description>

Abstract: A framework for numerical evaluation of entropy-conservative volume fluxes in gas flows with internal energies is developed, for use with high-order discretization methods. The novelty of the approach lies in the ability to use arbitrary expressions for the internal degrees of freedom of the constituent gas species. The developed approach is implemented in an open-source discontinuous Galerkin code for solving hyperbolic equations. Numerical simulations are carried out for several model 2-D flows and the results are compared to those obtained with the finite volume-based solver DLR TAU.</description>
