      <title>Joint Beamforming and Position Optimization for Movable-Antenna and Movable-Element RIS-Aided Full-Duplex 6G MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-duplex communication substantially enhances spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous transmission and reception on the same time-frequency resources. However, its practical deployment remains hindered by strong residual self-interference and inter-user interference, which severely degrade system performance. This work investigates a full-duplex MISO network that leverages movable-antenna base stations (MA-BS) and movable-element reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ME-RIS) to overcome these limitations in next-generation 6G systems. Unlike conventional fixed-geometry architectures, the proposed framework jointly optimizes antenna and RIS element positions, together with RIS phase shifts, to strengthen desired links while suppressing interference. Our design objective is to maximize the system sum rate through the joint optimization of transmit and receive beamforming vectors, uplink transmit powers, RIS phase shifts, and the spatial locations of both the BS antennas and RIS elements. To solve this challenging nonconvex problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed, employing semidefinite relaxation for beamforming design and successive convex approximation for position optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ME-RIS-assisted architecture with movable BS antennas offers substantial gains over conventional fixed-position full-duplex networks. These findings highlight the potential of integrating movable antennas with movable RIS elements as a key enabler for high-performance full-duplex operation in future 6G wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Consensus-Based Distributed Beamforming for Wideband Cell-free Multi-RIS MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cell-free networking paradigm constitutes a revolutionary architecture for future generations of wireless networks, which has been recently considered in synergy with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), a promising physical-layer technology for signal propagation programmability. In this paper, we focus on wideband cell-free multi-RIS-empowered Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) systems and present a decentralized cooperative active and passive beamforming scheme, aiming to provide an efficient alternative towards the cooperation overhead of available centralized schemes depending on central processing unit. Considering imperfect channel information availability and realistic frequency selectivity behavior of each RIS's element response, we devise a distributed optimization approach based on consensus updates for the RISs' phase configurations. Our simulation results showcase that the proposed distributed design is superior to centralized schemes that are based on various Lorentzian-type wideband modeling approaches for the RISs.</description>

      <title>Joint DOA and Non-circular Phase Estimation of Non-circular Signals for Antenna Arrays: Block Sparse Bayesian Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) algorithm of non-circular (NC) signals for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which is suitable for arbitrary unknown NC phases. The block sparse NC signal representation model is constructed through a permutation strategy, capturing the available intra-block structure information to enhance recovery performance. After that, we create the sparse probability model and derive the cost function under BSBL framework. Finally, the fast marginal likelihood maximum (FMLM) algorithm is introduced, enabling the rapid implementation of signal recovery by the addition and removal of basis functions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the superior performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Stream Sensing for Grant-Free Access: Deep Learning with Covariance Differencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grant-free (GF) access is essential for massive connectivity but faces collision risks due to uncoordinated transmissions. While user-side sensing can mitigate these collisions by enabling autonomous transmission decisions, conventional methods become ineffective in overloaded scenarios where active streams exceed receive antennas. To address this problem, we propose a differential stream sensing framework that reframes the problem from estimating the total stream count to isolating newly activated streams via covariance differencing. We analyze the covariance deviation induced by channel variations to establish a theoretical bound based on channel correlation for determining the sensing window size. To mitigate residual interference from finite sampling, a deep learning (DL) classifier is integrated. Simulations across both independent and identically distributed flat Rayleigh fading and standardized channel environments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms non-DL baselines and remains robust in overloaded scenarios.</description>

      <title>WiFo-M$^2$: Plug-and-Play Multi-Modal Sensing via Foundation Model to Empower Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of sensor-rich intelligent systems has boosted the use of multi-modal sensing to improve wireless communications. However, traditional methods require extensive manual design of data preprocessing, network architecture, and task-specific fine-tuning, which limits both development scalability and real-world deployment. To address this, we propose WiFo-M$^2$, a foundation model that can be easily plugged into existing deep learning-based transceivers for universal performance gains. To extract generalizable out-of-band (OOB) channel features from multi-modal sensing, we introduce ContraSoM, a contrastive pre-training strategy. Once pre-trained, WiFo-M$^2$ infers future OOB channel features from historical sensor data and strengthens feature robustness via modality-specific data augmentation. Experiments show that WiFo-M$^2$ improves performance across multiple transceiver designs and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>WiFo-E: A Scalable Wireless Foundation Model for End-to-End FDD Precoding in Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate precoding in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-division duplexing (FDD) systems relies on efficient channel state information (CSI) acquisition. End-to-end learning frameworks improve performance by jointly optimizing this process, but they lack scalability and fail to generalize across different system configurations, such as varying numbers of antennas and users. To overcome this limitation, we introduce WiFo-E, a wireless foundation model designed for scalable end-to-end precoding. WiFo-E employs multi-task pretraining on a diverse set of configurations to learn transferable representations of underlying wireless principles. Central to the model is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer architecture, which mitigates task interference and enhances training efficiency by activating specialized parameter subsets adaptively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that WiFo-E outperforms conventional per-configuration training and shows strong generalization to unseen system configurations, providing a flexible and efficient foundation for adaptive massive MIMO precoding.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Empowered Channel Prediction: A New Paradigm for Propagation Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm centered on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-empowered propagation channel prediction to address the limitations of traditional channel modeling. We present a comprehensive framework that deeply integrates heterogeneous environmental data and physical propagation knowledge into AI models for site-specific channel prediction, which referred to as channel inference. By leveraging AI to infer site-specific wireless channel states, the proposed paradigm enables accurate prediction of channel characteristics at both link and area levels, capturing spatio-temporal evolution of radio propagation. Some novel strategies to realize the paradigm are introduced and discussed, including AI-native and AI-hybrid inference approaches. This paper also investigates how to enhance model generalization through transfer learning and improve interpretability via explainable AI techniques. Our approach demonstrates significant practical efficacy, achieving an average path loss prediction root mean square error (RMSE) of $\sim$ 4 dB and reducing training time by 60\%-75\%. This new modeling paradigm provides a foundational pathway toward high-fidelity, generalizable, and physically consistent propagation channel prediction for future communication networks.</description>

      <title>Range-Doppler-Acceleration Estimation for Fast-Moving and Accelerating Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central aspect of every pulsed radar signal processor is the targets Range-Doppler estimation within a Coherent Processing Interval. Conventional methods typically rely on simplifying assumptions, such as linear target motion, narrowband operation, or constant velocity, to enable fast computation. However, these assumptions break down in scenarios involving quadratic range-time behavior, high radial velocities or accelerations, or wideband signals, leading to undesired effects such as intra-pulse Doppler shift/stretch and target migration across Range-Doppler cells. This paper presents a generalized waveform-independent Range-Doppler compression approach that compensates for these effects while maintaining minimal Signal-to-Noise-Ratio loss and practical computational efficiency. The performance limits of the proposed method are analyzed and expressed through a unified metric that depends on both scene and system parameters. Comparison with other approaches is presented, showing their estimation bias and performance degradation.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework for Improved Short-Term Peak-Flow Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable river flow forecasting is an essential component of flood risk management and early warning systems. It enables improved emergency response coordination and is critical for protecting infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems from extreme hydrological events. Process-based hydrological models and purely data-driven approaches often underperform during extreme events, particularly in forecasting peak flows. To address this limitation, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that couples Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF). XGBoost is employed for continuous streamflow forecasting, while RF is specifically trained for peak-flow prediction, and the two outputs are combined into an enhanced forecast. The approach is implemented across 857 catchments of the LamaH-CE dataset, using rainfall and discharge observations at 6-hour resolution. Results demonstrate consistently high skill, with 71% of catchments achieving a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.90. Peak-flow detection reaches 87%, with a false-alarm rate of 13%. Compared to the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), the framework achieves lower peak-magnitude errors, fewer false alarms, and improved streamflow and peak-flow forecasting accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally lightweight, scalable, and easily transferable across watersheds, with training times of only seconds on standard CPUs. These findings highlight the potential of integrating hydrological understanding with efficient machine learning to improve the accuracy and reliability of operational flood forecasting, and outline future directions for hybrid hydrological-machine learning model development.</description>

      <title>Unique Word Channel Estimation for Oversampled OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical aspects of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), such as channel estimation and its performance in fractional delay-Doppler (DD) channels, are a lively topic in the OTFS community. Oversampling and pulse shaping are also discussed in the existing literature, but not in the context of channel estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of data-to-pilot and vice versa energy leakage caused by oversampling and pulse shaping in OTFS. Theoretical analysis is performed on an oversampled, pulse-shaped OTFS implementing the embedded pilot channel estimation technique, revealing a trade-off between the amount of energy leakage and excess bandwidth introduced by the pulse shape. Next, a novel variant of OTFS is introduced, called UW-OTFS, which is designed to overcome the leakage problem by placing the pilot in the oversampled time domain instead of the DD domain. The unique structure of UW-OTFS offers 36 percent higher spectral efficiency than the OTFS with embedded pilot. UW-OTFS also outperforms traditional OTFS in terms of bit error ratio and out-of-band emissions.</description>

      <title>Uplink Multi-User MIMO Implementation in OpenAirInterface for a Cell-Free O-RAN Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-Free Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) have been active research topics in the wireless communication community in recent years. As an open-source software implementation of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 5th Generation (5G) protocol stack, OpenAirInterface (OAI) has become a valuable tool for deploying and testing new ideas in wireless communication systems. In this paper, we present our OAI based real-time uplink Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) testbed developed at Fraunhofer HHI. As a part of our Cell-Free MIMO testbed development, we built a 2x2 MU-MIMO system using general purpose computers and commercially available software defined radios (SDRs). Using a modified OAI next-Generation Node-B (gNB) and two unmodified OAI user equipment (UE), we show that it is feasible to use Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) channel estimates to compute uplink combiners. Our results verify that this method can be used to separate and decode signals from two users transmitting in nonorthogonal time-frequency resources. This work serves as an important verification step to build a complete Cell-Free MU-MIMO system that leverages time domain duplexing (TDD) reciprocity to do downlink beamforming over multiple cells.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Gain with Nonideal Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research sets forth a universal framework to characterize the beamforming gain achievable with arbitrarily nonideal phase shifters. Precisely, the maximum possible shortfall relative to the gain attainable with ideal phase shifters is established. Such shortfall is shown to be fundamentally determined by the perimeter of the convex hull of the set of feasible beamforming coefficients on the complex plane. This result holds regardless of whether the beamforming is at the transmitter, at the receiver, or at a reconfigurable intelligent surface. In i.i.d. fading channels, the shortfall hardens to the maximum possible shortfall as the number of antennas grows.</description>

      <title>Two-Scale Spatial Deployment for Cost-Effective Wireless Networks via Cooperative IRSs and Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-scale spatial deployment strategy to ensure reliable coverage for multiple target areas, integrating macroscopic intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and fine-grained movable antennas (MAs). Specifically, IRSs are selectively deployed from candidate sites to shape the propagation geometry, while MAs are locally repositioned among discretized locations to exploit small-scale channel variations. The objective is to minimize the total deployment cost of MAs and IRSs by jointly optimizing the IRS site selection, MA positions, transmit precoding, and IRS phase shifts, subject to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for all target areas. This leads to a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem that is intractable to solve directly. To address this, we first formulate an auxiliary problem to verify the feasibility. A penalty-based double-loop algorithm integrating alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed to solve this feasibility issue, which is subsequently adapted to obtain a suboptimal solution for the original cost minimization problem. Finally, based on the obtained solution, we formulate an element refinement problem to further reduce the deployment cost, which is solved by a penalty-based SCA algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed designs consistently outperform benchmarks relying on independent area planning or full IRS deployment in terms of cost-efficiency. Moreover, for cost minimization, MA architectures are preferable in large placement apertures, whereas fully populated FPA architectures excel in compact ones; for worst-case SNR maximization, MA architectures exhibit a lower cost threshold for feasibility, while FPA architectures can attain peak SNR at a lower total cost.</description>

      <title>Echo-Side Integrated Sensing and Communication via Space-Time Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an echo-side modulation framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A space-time reconfigurable intelligent surface (ST-RIS) impresses a continuous-phase modulation onto the radar echo, enabling uplink data transmission with a phase modulation of the transmitted radar-like waveform. The received signal is a multiplicative composition of the sensing waveform and the phase for communication. Both functionalities share the same physical signal and perceive each other as impairments.
  The achievable communication rate is expressed as a function of a coupling parameter that links sensing accuracy to phase error accumulation. Under a fixed bandwidth constraint, the sensing and communication figures of merit define a convex Pareto frontier. The optimal bandwidth allocation satisfying a minimum sensing requirement is derived in closed form. The modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) for range estimation is derived in closed form; this parameter must be estimated to compensate for the frequency offset before data demodulation. Frame synchronization is formulated as a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and the detection probability is obtained through characteristic function inversion, accounting for residual frequency errors from imperfect range estimation. Numerical results validate the theoretical bounds and characterize the trade-off across the operating range.</description>

      <title>Evaluating GAN-LSTM for Smart Meter Anomaly Detection in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) provides high-resolution electricity consumption data that can enhance monitoring, diagnosis, and decision making in modern power distribution systems. Detecting anomalies in these time-series measurements is challenging due to nonlinear, nonstationary, and multi-scale temporal behavior across diverse building types and operating conditions. This work presents a systematic, power-system-oriented evaluation of a GAN-LSTM framework for smart meter anomaly detection using the Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD) dataset, which contains one year of hourly measurements from 406 buildings. The proposed pipeline applies consistent preprocessing, temporal windowing, and threshold selection across all methods, and compares the GAN-LSTM approach against six widely used baselines, including statistical, kernel-based, reconstruction-based, and GAN-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-LSTM significantly improves detection performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.89. These findings highlight the potential of adversarial temporal modeling as a practical tool for supporting asset monitoring, non-technical loss detection, and situational awareness in real-world power distribution networks.

      <title>Changes in Visual Attention Patterns for Detection Tasks due to Dependencies on Signal and Background Spatial Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to investigate the impact of image and signal properties on visual attention mechanisms during a signal detection task in digital images. The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.</description>

      <title>Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifolds: Cross-Domain Representation Learning via Homeomorphism Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifold (ULHM), a framework that unifies semantic representations (e.g., human descriptions, diagnostic labels) and observation-driven machine representations (e.g., pixel intensities, sensor readings) into a single latent structure. Despite originating from fundamentally different pathways, both modalities capture the same underlying reality. We establish \emph{homeomorphism}, a continuous bijection preserving topological structure, as the mathematical criterion for determining when latent manifolds induced by different semantic-observation pairs can be rigorously unified. This criterion provides theoretical guarantees for three critical applications: (1) semantic-guided sparse recovery from incomplete observations, (2) cross-domain transfer learning with verified structural compatibility, and (3) zero-shot compositional learning via valid transfer from semantic to observation space. Our framework learns continuous manifold-to-manifold transformations through conditional variational inference, avoiding brittle point-to-point mappings. We develop practical verification algorithms, including trust, continuity, and Wasserstein distance metrics, that empirically validate homeomorphic structure from finite samples. Experiments demonstrate: (1) sparse image recovery from 5\% of CelebA pixels and MNIST digit reconstruction at multiple sparsity levels, (2) cross-domain classifier transfer achieving 86.73\% accuracy from MNIST to Fashion-MNIST without retraining, and (3) zero-shot classification on unseen classes achieving 89.47\% on MNIST, 84.70\% on Fashion-MNIST, and 78.76\% on CIFAR-10. Critically, the homeomorphism criterion correctly rejects incompatible datasets, preventing invalid unification and providing a feasible way to principled decomposition of general foundation models into verified domain-specific components.</description>

      <title>Lean Clients, Full Accuracy: Hybrid Zeroth- and First-Order Split Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables collaborative training between resource-constrained edge devices and a compute-rich server. Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Shadow: Bending Airy Beams for Radiative Near-Field Multi-User Access in Half-Space Blockage Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, making hardware remedies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) impractical. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves an SNR improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description>

      <title>Explainable Autoencoder-Based Anomaly Detection in IEC 61850 GOOSE Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IEC 61850 Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol plays a critical role in real-time protection and automation of digital substations, yet its lack of native security mechanisms can expose power systems to sophisticated cyberattacks. Traditional rule-based and supervised intrusion detection techniques struggle to detect protocol-compliant and zero-day attacks under significant class imbalance and limited availability of labeled data. This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing. Experimental results show attack detection rates above 99% with false positives remaining below 5% of total traffic, demonstrating strong generalization across environments and effective operation under extreme class imbalance and interpretable anomaly attribution.</description>

      <title>FairShare: Auditable Geographic Fairness for Multi-Operator LEO Spectrum Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) among multi-operator low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations is essential for coexistence, yet prevailing policies focus almost exclusively on interference mitigation, leaving geographic equity largely unaddressed. This work investigates whether conventional DSS approaches inadvertently exacerbate the rural digital divide. Through large-scale, 3GPP-compliant non-terrestrial network (NTN) simulations with geographically distributed users, we systematically evaluate standard allocation policies. The results uncover a stark and persistent structural bias: SNR-priority scheduling induces a 1.65x urban-rural access disparity, privileging users with favorable satellite geometry. Counter-intuitively, increasing system bandwidth amplifies rather than alleviates this gap, with disparity rising from 1.0x to 1.65x as resources expand. To remedy this, we propose FairShare, a lightweight, quota-based framework that enforces geographic fairness. FairShare not only reverses the bias, achieving an affirmative disparity ratio of Delta_geo = 0.72x, but also reduces scheduler runtime by 3.3%. This demonstrates that algorithmic fairness can be achieved without trading off efficiency or complexity. Our work provides regulators with both a diagnostic metric for auditing fairness and a practical, enforceable mechanism for equitable spectrum governance in next-generation satellite networks.</description>

      <title>TDGCN-Based Mobile Multiuser Physical-Layer Authentication for EI-Enabled IIoT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) offers endogenous security, lightweight implementation, and high reliability, making it a promising complement to upper-layer security methods in Edge Intelligence (EI)-empowered Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, state-of-the-art Channel State Information (CSI)-based PLA schemes face challenges in recognizing mobile multi-users due to the constantly shifting CSI distributions with user movements. To address this issue, we propose a Temporal Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (TDGCN)-based PLA scheme, which employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics induced by user movements. Firstly, we partition CSI fingerprints into multivariate time series and utilize dynamic GNNs to capture their associations. Secondly, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) handle temporal dependencies within each CSI fingerprint dimension. Additionally, Dynamic Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs) and cascade node clustering pooling further enable efficient information aggregation and reduced computational complexity. Simulations demonstrate the proposed scheme's superior authentication accuracy compared to seven baseline schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of machine learning in wireless communications has been extensively explored, with deep unfolding emerging as a powerful model-based technique. Deep unfolding enhances interpretability by transforming complex iterative algorithms into structured layers of deep neural networks (DNNs). This approach seamlessly integrates domain knowledge with deep learning (DL), leveraging the strengths of both methods to simplify complex signal processing tasks in communication systems. To provide a solid foundation, we first present a brief overview of DL and deep unfolding. We then explore the applications of deep unfolding in key areas, including signal detection, channel estimation, beamforming design, decoding for error-correcting codes, sensing and communication, power allocation, and security. Each section focuses on a specific task, highlighting its significance in emerging 6G technologies and reviewing recent advancements in deep unfolding-based solutions. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with developing deep unfolding techniques and propose potential improvements to enhance their applicability across diverse wireless communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum MIMO Receivers for The Multi-User Uplink</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution for evolving wireless receivers from the classical to the quantum domain. To further unleash their great potential in wireless communications, we propose a flexible architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) receivers in the multi-user uplink. Then the corresponding signal model of the RAQ-MIMO system is constructed by paving the way from quantum physics to classical wireless communications. Explicitly, we outline the associated operating principles and transmission flow. We also validate the linearity of our model and its feasible region. Based on our model, we derive closed-form asymptotic formulas for the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) of both the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers operating in uncorrelated fading channels (UFC) and the correlated fading channels (CFC), as well as in the standard quantum limit (SQL) and photon shot limit (PSL) regimes, respectively. Furthermore, we unveil that the EAR scales logarithmically without bound with the product of effective number $N_{\text{atom}}$ and coherence time $T_2$ of the atomic ensemble in the SQL regime, but exhibits non-monotonic trade-off between the collective atomic enhancement and optical-depth-dependent attenuation in the PSL regime. More particularly, the transmit power of users can be scaled down quadratically with $N_{\text{atom}} \tau$, $\tau \in \{ T_2, \frac{ {\cal C} (\Omega_{\ell}) }{A_p} \}$, but the EAR per user retains fixed, by increasing $N_{\text{atom}}$ while retaining the sensor number $M \propto N_{\text{atom}} \tau$ in the SQL regime or $M \propto \exp \big( \frac{N_{\text{atom}} {\bar \chi}}{A_p} \big)$ in the PSL regime....</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system suffers from severe Doppler shifts, while {the Doppler-resilient affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) transmission suffers from significantly high processing complexity in data detection}. In this paper, we explore the channel estimation gain of affine frequency (AF) domain pilot to enhance the OFDM transmission under high mobility. Specifically, we propose a novel AF domain pilot embedding scheme for satellite-ground downlink OFDM systems for capturing the channel characteristics. By exploiting the autoregressive (AR) property of adjacent channels, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based predictor is designed to replace conventional interpolation operation in OFDM channel estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed transmission scheme significantly outperforms conventional OFDM scheme in terms of bit error rate (BER) under high Doppler scenarios, thus paving a new way for the design of next generation non-terrestrial network (NTN) communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle based communication using diffusion and advection has emerged as an alternative signaling paradigm recently. While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments.</description>

Abstract: Neural network-based radio receivers are expected to play a key role in future wireless systems, making reliable Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection essential. We propose a post-hoc, layerwise OOD framework based on channelwise feature aggregation that avoids classwise statistics--critical for multi-label soft-bit outputs with astronomically many classes. Receiver activations exhibit no discrete clusters but a smooth Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR)-aligned manifold, consistent with classical receiver behavior and motivating manifold-aware OOD detection. We evaluate multiple OOD feature types, distance metrics, and methods across layers. Gaussian Mahalanobis with mean activations is the strongest single detector, earlier layers outperform later, and SNR/classifier fusions offer small, inconsistent AUROC gains. High-delay OOD is detected reliably, while high-speed remains challenging.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Emulation of the Radio Resource Control Layer: Towards AI-Native RAN Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16821v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating Large AI Models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks is a key enabler of the AI-Native Air Interface (AI-AI), where protocol intelligence must scale beyond handcrafted logic. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first standards-compliant emulation of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer using a decoder-only LAM (LLAMA-class) fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a multi-vendor corpus of real-world traces spanning both 5G and 4G systems. We treat RRC as a domain-specific language and construct a segmentation-safe, question-answer (Question-and-Answer (QA)) dataset that preserves Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) structure through linearization prior to Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization. The proposed approach combines parameter-efficient adaptation with schema-bounded prompting to ensure syntactic and procedural fidelity. Evaluation introduces a standards-aware triad -- ASN.1 conformance, field-level coverage analysis, and uplink-to-downlink state-machine checks -- alongside semantic similarity and latency profiling across 120 configurations. On 30k 5G request-response pairs plus an additional 4.8k QA turns from 4G sessions, our 8B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97, a 61% relative gain over a zero-shot baseline, while sustaining high conformance rates. These results demonstrate that LAMs, when augmented with protocol-aware reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, laying the foundation for the future Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native Radio Access Network (RAN).</description>

Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.</description>
