      <title>Convex Team Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove expressive completeness results for convex propositional and modal team logics, where a logic is convex if, for each formula, if it is true in two teams $t$ and $u$ and $t\subseteq s\subseteq u$, then it is also true in $s$. We introduce multiple propositional/modal logics which are expressively complete for the class of all convex propositional/modal team properties. We also answer an open question concerning the expressive power of classical propositional logic extended with the nonemptiness atom NE: we show that it is expressively complete for the class of all convex and union-closed properties. A modal analogue of this result additionally yields an expressive completeness theorem for Aloni's Bilateral State-based Modal Logic.
  In a specific sense, one of the novel propositional convex logics extends propositional dependence logic and another, propositional inquisitive logic. We generalize the notion of uniform definability, as considered in the team semantics literature, to formalize the notion of extension pertaining to the convex logics.</description>

      <title>Fractal Countability as a Constructive Alternative to the Power Set of N: A Meta-Formal Approach to Stratified Definability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical set theory constructs the continuum via the power set P(N), thereby postulating an uncountable totality. However, constructive and computability-based approaches reveal that no formal system with countable syntax can generate all subsets of N, nor can it capture the real line in full. In this paper, we propose fractal countability as a constructive alternative to the power set. Rather than treating countability as an absolute cardinal notion, we redefine it as a stratified, process-relative closure over definable subsets, generated by a sequence of conservative extensions to a base formal system. This yields a structured, internally growing hierarchy of constructive definability that remains within the countable realm but approximates the expressive richness of the continuum. We compare fractally countable sets to classical countability and the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, and interpret the continuum not as a completed object, but as a layered definitional horizon. This framework provides a constructive reinterpretation of power set-like operations without invoking non-effective principles.</description>

      <title>Models of an Abstract Elementary Class as a Generalized Polish Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In first order logic, it is known that you can define a topology so that the countable models of some theory $T$ form a Polish Space (i.e. completely metrizable second countable space).
  In this paper we use the Baldwin- Boney Relational Presentation Theorem (from [3]; cf. 2.3) to generalize this result to the models of an Abstract Elementary Class (AEC). More specifically, we define a topology on the models of an AEC of size $\lambda \geq \kappa$, where $\kappa$ is the L$\ddot{o}$wenheim-Skolem number and $\lambda$ has to satisfy a set-theoretic assumption (see Section 4) and prove that these models form a Generalized Polish Space (i.e. a generalization of Polish Spaces i.e. completely $G$-metrizable space with weight $\leq \kappa$).</description>

      <title>A Friedman--Sheard-style Theory for Classical Realisability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Hayashi and Leigh (2024), the authors formulate classical number realisability for first-order arithmetic and a corresponding axiomatic system based on Krivine's classical realisability interpretation. This paper presents a self-referential generalisation of previous results in the spirit of Friedman and Sheard (1987).</description>

      <title>Reaching Classicality through Transitive Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, arXiv:2312.16035 showed that all logics based on Boolean Normal monotonic three-valued schemes coincide with classical logic when defined using a strict-tolerant standard ($\mathbf{st}$). Conversely, they proved that under a tolerant-strict standard ($\mathbf{ts}$), the resulting logics are all empty. Building on these results, we show that classical logic can be obtained by closing under transitivity the union of two logics defined over (potentially different) Boolean normal monotonic schemes, using a strict-strict standard ($\mathbf{ss}$) for one and a tolerant-tolerant standard ($\mathbf{tt}$) for the other, with the first of these logics being paracomplete and the other being paraconsistent. We then identify a notion dual to transitivity that allows us to characterize the logic $\mathsf{TS}$ as the dual transitive closure of the intersection of any two logics defined over (potentially different) Boolean normal monotonic schemes, using an $\mathbf{ss}$ standard for one and a $\mathbf{tt}$ standard for the other. Finally, we expand on the abstract relations between the transitive closure and dual transitive closure operations, showing that they give rise to lattice operations that precisely capture how the logics discussed relate to one another.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees and the two-branching pseudotree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22626v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that each finite chain in the two-branching countable ultrahomogeneous pseudotree has finite big Ramsey degrees. This is in contrast to the recent result of Chodounsk\'{y}, Eskew, and Weinert that antichains of size two have infinite big Ramsey degree in the pseudotree. Combining a lower bound result of theirs with work in this paper shows that chains of length two in the pseudotree have big Ramsey degree exactly seven. The pseudotree is the first example of a countable ultrahomogeneous structure in a finite language in which some finite substructures have finite big Ramsey degrees while others have infinite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <title>Schur ultrafilters and Bohr compactifications of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Schur ultrafilters on groups. Using the algebraic structure of Stone-\v{C}ech compactifications of discrete groups and Schur ultrafilters, we give a new description of Bohr compactifications of topological groups. This approach allows us to characterize chart groups that are topological groups. Namely, a chart group $G$ is a topological group if and only if each Schur ultrafilter on $G$ converges to the unit of $G$.</description>
