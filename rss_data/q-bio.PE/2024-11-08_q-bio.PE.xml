      <title>Dynamics of a Tuberculosis Outbreak Model in a Multi-scale Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation approaches for infectious disease dynamics have proven to be essential tools for effective control of the spread of epidemics in the population. Among these approaches, it is obvious that compartmental mathematical models, such as SIS, SIR, SEIR, etc. are the most widely used by researchers. However, they are difficult to apply in a multi-scale environment, especially if we want to take into account the heterogeneous behaviors of individuals. The aim of this paper is to present a hybrid model in which an Equation-Based Model (EBM) of tuberculosis dynamics is coupled to an Agent-Based Model (ABM) in a two-scale environment. In this model, individuals are placed in cities considered as agents in which the dynamics of the disease is modeled by eight compartments and managed by solving a system of differential equations. Individual agents move between these cities using an ABM that controls their mobility. Considering some parametric values and assumptions, the results obtained show that human mobility has a significant impact on the spread of tuberculosis within the population. The management of population and disease dynamics at different levels (microscopic and macroscopic) testifies to the robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Strong anomalous diffusion for free-ranging birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to explore causes and consequences of movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\textit{Tyto alba}), we demonstrate the necessity of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize bird movement across scales. The mean and MSD -- interchangeable with moments $q=1$ and 2 -- are insufficient special cases. We reveal empirical strong anomalous diffusion as a nonlinear growth of displacement moments according to $\left&lt;|x(t)|^q\right&gt; \sim t^{\lambda(q)}$. The moment spectrum function $\lambda(q)$ displays piecewise linearity with a critical moment marking the crossover point between two scaling regimes, linked to a combination of age-specific behavioral modes. A critical timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex $\lambda_s(q)$ to a concave $\lambda_\ell(q)$, related to environmental and behavioral constraints. Using two stochastic models of varying ecological complexity, we demonstrate that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement, underscoring the importance of expanding analysis beyond the average and MSD.</description>

      <title>Simplifying and Characterizing DAGs and Phylogenetic Networks via Least Common Ancestor Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks, or more generally, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are widely used to model species or gene relationships that traditional rooted trees cannot fully capture, especially in the presence of reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfers. Such networks or DAGs are typically inferred from genomic data of extant taxa, providing only an estimate of the true evolutionary history. However, these inferred DAGs are often complex and difficult to interpret. In particular, many contain vertices that do not serve as least common ancestors (LCAs) for any subset of the underlying genes or species, thus lacking direct support from the observed data. In contrast, LCA vertices represent ancestral states substantiated by the data, offering important insights into evolutionary relationships among subsets of taxa. To reduce unnecessary complexity and eliminate unsupported vertices, we aim to simplify a DAG to retain only LCA vertices while preserving essential evolutionary information.
  In this paper, we characterize $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant and $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant DAGs, defined as those in which every vertex serves as an LCA (or unique LCA) for some subset of taxa. We introduce methods to identify LCAs in DAGs and efficiently transform any DAG into an $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant or $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant one while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG or network. This transformation is achieved using a simple operator ``$\ominus$'' that mimics vertex suppression.</description>

      <title>A review of statistical models used to characterize species-habitat associations with animal movement data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding species-habitat associations is fundamental to ecological sciences and for species conservation. Consequently, various statistical approaches have been designed to infer species-habitat associations. Due to their conceptual and mathematical differences, these methods can yield contrasting results. In this paper, we describe and compare commonly used statistical models that relate animal movement data to environmental data. Specifically, we examined selection functions which include resource selection function (RSF) and step-selection function (SSF), as well as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and related methods such as state-space models. We demonstrate differences in assumptions of each method while highlighting advantages and limitations. Additionally, we provide guidance on selecting the most appropriate statistical method based on research objectives and intended inference. To demonstrate the varying ecological insights derived from each statistical model, we apply them to the movement track of a single ringed seal in a case study. For example, the RSF indicated selection of areas with high prey diversity, whereas the SSFs indicated no discernable relationship with prey diversity. Furthermore, the HMM reveals variable associations with prey diversity across different behaviors. Notably, the three models identified different important areas. This case study highlights the critical significance of selecting the appropriate model to identify species-habitat relationships and specific areas of importance. Our comprehensive review provides the foundational information required for making informed decisions when choosing the most suitable statistical methods to address specific questions, such as identifying expansive corridors or protected zones, understanding movement patterns, or studying behaviours.</description>

      <title>Complexity-stability relationships in competitive disordered dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robert May famously used random matrix theory to predict that large, complex systems cannot admit stable fixed points. However, this general conclusion is not always supported by empirical observation: from cells to biomes, biological systems are large, complex, and often stable. In this paper, we revisit May's argument in light of recent developments in both ecology and random matrix theory. We focus on competitive systems, and, using a nonlinear generalization of the competitive Lotka-Volterra model, we show that there are, in fact, two kinds of complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems: if self-interactions grow faster with density than cross-interactions, complexity is destabilizing; but if cross-interactions grow faster than self-interactions, complexity is stabilizing.</description>
