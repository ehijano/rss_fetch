      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. III: Einstein phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersionless limit of the standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied. The effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by Einstein phonons of frequency $\Omega&gt;0$, equipped with electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda$. This allows for a detailed evaluation of the general results on $T_c$ for phonons with non-trivial dispersion relation, obtained in a previous paper, (II), by the authors. The variational principle for the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal state region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, obtained in (II), simplifies as follows: If $(\lambda,\Omega,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$, where $\varpi:=\Omega/2\pi T$, and where $\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)&gt;0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences; $\mathfrak{H}(\varpi)$ is the dispersionless limit $P(d\omega)\to\delta(\omega-\Omega)d\omega$ of the operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ of (II). It is shown that when $\varpi \leq \sqrt{2}$, then the map $\varpi\mapsto\mathfrak{h}(\varpi)$ is invertible. For $\lambda&gt;0.77$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) = \Omega f(\lambda)$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $f(\lambda)$ that converges to $f(\lambda)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,\Omega)$, which agrees with the asymptotic behavior $T_c(\lambda,\Omega) \sim C \Omega\sqrt{\lambda}$ for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $\Omega$, though with $C\approx 2.034 C_\infty$, where $C_\infty := \frac{1}{2\pi}\mathfrak{k}(2)^\frac12 =0.1827262477...$ is the optimal constant, and $\mathfrak{k}(\gamma)&gt;0$ the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator for the $\gamma$ model, determined in the first paper, (I), on $T_c$ by the authors.</description>

      <title>Nodeless superconductivity and topological nodal states in molybdenum carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orthorhombic molybdenum carbide superconductor with $T_c$ = 3.2 K was investigated by muon-spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements and by first-principle calculations. The low-temperature superfluid density, determined by transverse-field $\mu$SR, suggests a fully-gapped superconducting state in Mo$_2$C, with a zero-temperature gap $\Delta_0$ = 0.44 meV and a magnetic penetration depth $\lambda_0$ = 291 nm. The time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state, as confirmed by the absence of an additional muon-spin relaxation in the zero-field $\mu$SR spectra. Band-structure calculations indicate that the density of states at the Fermi level is dominated by the Mo $4d$-orbitals, which are marginally hybridized with the C $2p$-orbitals over a wide energy range. The symmetry analysis confirms that, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Mo$_2$C hosts twofold-degenerate nodal surfaces and fourfold-degenerate nodal lines. When considering SOC, the fourfold-degenerate nodal lines cross the Fermi level and contribute to the electronic properties. Our results suggest that, similarly to other phases of carbides, also the orthorhombic transition-metal carbides host topological nodal states and may be potential candidates for future studies of topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Single photon detection up to 2 um in pair of parallel microstrips based on NbRe ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting Microstrip Single Photon Detectors (SMSPDs) are increasingly attracting the interest of the scientific community as a new platform for large area detectors with unprecedented advantaged in terms of fabrication. However, while their operativity at the telecommunication wavelength was achieved, working beyond 1.55 um is challenging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate single-photon operation of NbRe microstrips at wavelengths of 1.55 and 2 um. The devices are structured as pairs of parallel microstrips with widths ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 um and lengths from 5 to 10 um. This innovative design may assure large sensitive areas, without affecting the kinetic inductance, namely the time performance of the detectors. The results are discussed in the framework of the hot-spot two-temperature model.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna Analytic Continuation for Migdal-Eliashberg Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a method to reconstruct real-frequency properties from analytically continued causal Green's functions within the framework of Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theory for superconductivity. ME theory involves solving a set of coupled equations self-consistently in imaginary frequency space, but to obtain experimentally measurable properties like the spectral function and quasiparticle density of states, it is necessary to perform an analytic continuation to real frequency space. Traditionally, the ME Green's function is decomposed into three fundamental complex functions, which are analytically continued independently. However, these functions do not possess the causal properties of Green's functions, complicating or even preventing the application of standard methods such as Maximum Entropy. Our approach overcomes these challenges, enabling the use of various analytic continuation techniques that were previously impractical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by combining it with Nevanlinna analytic continuation to achieve accurate real-frequency results for ME theory, which are directly comparable to experimental data, with applications highlighted for the superconductors MgB$_2$ and LaBeH$_8$.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in one-dimensional quantum wires connected to superconductors with mixed singlet-triplet pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by the anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires in Josephson junctions could serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>

      <title>Low-characteristic-impedance superconducting tadpole resonators in the sub-gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple and versatile resonator design based on a short strip of a typical coplanar waveguide shorted at one end to the ground and shunted at the other end with a large parallel-plate capacitor. Due to the shape of the structure, we coin it the tadpole resonator. The design allows tailoring the characteristic impedance of the resonator to especially suit applications requiring low values. We demonstrate characteristic impedances ranging from $Z_c = 2\,{\Omega}$ to $10\,{\Omega}$ and a frequency range from $f_0 = 290\,\mathrm{MHz}$ to $1.1\,\mathrm{GHz}$ while reaching internal quality factors of order $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.5\times 10^3$ translating into a loss tangent of $\tan({\delta}) = 1.2\times 10^{-4}$ for the aluminium oxide used as the dielectric in the parallel plate capacitor. We conclude that these tadpole resonators are well suited for applications requiring low frequency and low charactersitic impedance while maintaining a small footprint on chip. The low characteristic impedance of the tadpole resonator renders it a promising candidate for achieving strong inductive coupling to other microwave components.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectroscopic Study on Bi2Rh3Se2: Two-dimensional-Ising Charge Density Wave and Quantum Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ternary chalcogenide Bi2Rh3Se2 was found to be a charge density wave (CDW) superconductor with a 2*2 periodicity. The key questions regarding the underlying mechanism of CDW state and its interplay with lattice and electronic properties remains to be explored. Here, based on the systematic Raman scattering investigations on single crystalline Bi2Rh3Se2, we observed the fingerprinting feature of CDW state, a collective amplitude mode at 39 cm-1. The temperature evolution of Raman shift and line width for this amplitude mode can be well described by the critical behavior of two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, suggesting the interlayer interactions of Bi2Rh3Se2 is negligible when CDW state is formed, as a consequence, the quantum fluctuations play an important role at low temperature. Moreover, temperature dependence of Raman shift for Ag9 mode deviates significantly from the expected anharmonic behavior when approaching the CDW transition temperature 240 K, demonstrated that strong electron-phonon coupling plays a key role in the formation of CDW. Our results reveal that Bi2Rh3Se2 is an intriguing quasi-2D system to explore electronic quantum phase transition and modulate the correlations between CDW and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Andreev interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Josephson junction, formed between two phase-biased superconductors and a normal metal, hosts a discrete spectrum of Andreev bound states (ABS), as theoretically investigated by Kulik, and, later, by Ishii and by Bagwell. In this paper, we develop a theory for spectroscopy of Andreev bound states (ABS) in long ballistic Andreev interferometers. We specifically demonstrate that the differential conductance can directly probe the ABS spectrum, serving as an alternative to the more complex microwave spectroscopy technique. We consider three frameworks in our theoretical analysis: (i) Perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitudes, which leads to nonstandard phase-sensitive Andreev reflections coupling the supercurrent to the nonequilibrium populations in the normal region; (ii) Nonperturbative transport theory valid for all orders in tunneling and all dimensions of the device; and (iii) Physically-motivated approximations to visualize the conductance maps in the (flux, voltage) plane. We further show that our theory can capture the results of recent experiments by Penn State and Harvard groups.</description>
