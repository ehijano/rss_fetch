      <title>EyeNavGS: A 6-DoF Navigation Dataset and Record-n-Replay Software for Real-World 3DGS Scenes in VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging media representation that reconstructs real-world 3D scenes in high fidelity, enabling 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) navigation in virtual reality (VR). However, developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available 6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion, and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction, adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes. The EyeNavGS dataset is available at: https://symmru.github.io/EyeNavGS/.</description>

      <title>StarVC: A Unified Auto-Regressive Framework for Joint Text and Speech Generation in Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speech to match a target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Traditional methods usually extract speaker information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of linguistic content. Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could enhance conversion performance. However, previous attempts to incorporate semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the integration of explicit text modeling. We propose StarVC, a unified autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing acoustic features. The experiments demonstrate that StarVC outperforms conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS). Audio demo can be found at: https://thuhcsi.github.io/StarVC/.</description>

      <title>Controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Masked-Autoencoded Style-Rich Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable TTS models with natural language prompts often lack the ability for fine-grained control and face a scarcity of high-quality data. We propose a two-stage style-controllable TTS system with language models, utilizing a quantized masked-autoencoded style-rich representation as an intermediary. In the first stage, an autoregressive transformer is used for the conditional generation of these style-rich tokens from text and control signals. The second stage generates codec tokens from both text and sampled style-rich tokens. Experiments show that training the first-stage model on extensive datasets enhances the content robustness of the two-stage model as well as control capabilities over multiple attributes. By selectively combining discrete labels and speaker embeddings, we explore fully controlling the speaker's timbre and other stylistic information, and adjusting attributes like emotion for a specified speaker. Audio samples are available at https://style-ar-tts.github.io.</description>

      <title>LASPA: Language Agnostic Speaker Disentanglement with Prefix-Tuned Cross-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker recognition models face challenges in multi-lingual settings due to the entanglement of linguistic information within speaker embeddings. The overlap between vocal traits such as accent, vocal anatomy, and a language's phonetic structure complicates separating linguistic and speaker information. Disentangling these components can significantly improve speaker recognition accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel disentanglement learning strategy that integrates joint learning through prefix-tuned cross-attention. This approach is particularly effective when speakers switch between languages. Experimental results show the model generalizes across monolingual and multi-lingual settings, including unseen languages. Notably, the proposed model improves the equal error rate across multiple datasets, highlighting its ability to separate language information from speaker embeddings and enhance recognition in diverse linguistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Trusted Fake Audio Detection Based on Dirichlet Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the continuous development of deep learning-based speech conversion and speech synthesis technologies, the cybersecurity problem posed by fake audio has become increasingly serious. Previously proposed models for defending against fake audio have attained remarkable performance. However, they all fall short in modeling the trustworthiness of the decisions made by the models themselves. Based on this, we put forward a plausible fake audio detection approach based on the Dirichlet distribution with the aim of enhancing the reliability of fake audio detection. Specifically, we first generate evidence through a neural network. Uncertainty is then modeled using the Dirichlet distribution. By modeling the belief distribution with the parameters of the Dirichlet distribution, an estimate of uncertainty can be obtained for each decision. Finally, the predicted probabilities and corresponding uncertainty estimates are combined to form the final opinion. On the ASVspoof series dataset (i.e., ASVspoof 2019 LA, ASVspoof 2021 LA, and DF), we conduct a number of comparison experiments to verify the excellent performance of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, robustness, and trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Dynamic mapping from static labels: remote sensing dynamic sample generation with temporal-spectral embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate remote sensing geographic mapping depends heavily on representative and timely sample data. However, rapid changes in land surface dynamics necessitate frequent updates, quickly rendering previously collected samples obsolete and imposing significant labor demands for continuous manual updates. In this study, we aim to address this problem by dynamic sample generation using existing single-date static labeled samples. We introduce TasGen, a two-stage automated framework to automatically generate dynamic samples, designed to simultaneously model spectral and temporal dependencies in time-series remote sensing imagery via temporal-spectral embedding, capturing land surface changes without additional manual annotations.</description>

      <title>MERIT: Multilingual Semantic Retrieval with Interleaved Multi-Condition Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</description>

      <title>IllumiCraft: Unified Geometry and Illumination Diffusion for Controllable Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1) high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2) synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues; and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing controllable video generation methods.

      <title>T-TAME: Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explaining Convolutional Networks and Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development and adoption of Vision Transformers and other deep-learning architectures for image classification tasks has been rapid. However, the "black box" nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption in applications where explainability is essential. While some techniques for generating explanations have been proposed, primarily for Convolutional Neural Networks, adapting such techniques to the new paradigm of Vision Transformers is non-trivial. This paper presents T-TAME, Transformer-compatible Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations, a general methodology for explaining deep neural networks used in image classification tasks. The proposed architecture and training technique can be easily applied to any convolutional or Vision Transformer-like neural network, using a streamlined training approach. After training, explanation maps can be computed in a single forward pass; these explanation maps are comparable to or outperform the outputs of computationally expensive perturbation-based explainability techniques, achieving SOTA performance. We apply T-TAME to three popular deep learning classifier architectures, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, trained on the ImageNet dataset, and we demonstrate improvements over existing state-of-the-art explainability methods. A detailed analysis of the results and an ablation study provide insights into how the T-TAME design choices affect the quality of the generated explanation maps.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Jailbreak Attack for Image Generation Models via Editing Step by Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-based image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3, hold significant potential in content creation and publishing workflows, making them the focus in recent years. Despite their remarkable capability to generate diverse and vivid images, considerable efforts are being made to prevent the generation of harmful content, such as abusive, violent, or pornographic material. To assess the safety of existing models, we introduce a novel jailbreaking method called Chain-of-Jailbreak (CoJ) attack, which compromises image generation models through a step-by-step editing process. Specifically, for malicious queries that cannot bypass the safeguards with a single prompt, we intentionally decompose the query into multiple sub-queries. The image generation models are then prompted to generate and iteratively edit images based on these sub-queries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CoJ attack method, we constructed a comprehensive dataset, CoJ-Bench, encompassing nine safety scenarios, three types of editing operations, and three editing elements. Experiments on four widely-used image generation services provided by GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 and Gemini 1.5 Pro, demonstrate that our CoJ attack method can successfully bypass the safeguards of models for over 60% cases, which significantly outperforms other jailbreaking methods (i.e., 14%). Further, to enhance these models' safety against our CoJ attack method, we also propose an effective prompting-based method, Think Twice Prompting, that can successfully defend over 95% of CoJ attack. We release our dataset and code to facilitate the AI safety research.</description>

      <title>Ola: Pushing the Frontiers of Omni-Modal Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have sparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of understanding more modalities. While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal Language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts, pushing the frontiers of the omni-modal language model to a large extent. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of architectural design, data curation, and training strategies essential for building a robust omni-modal model. Ola incorporates advanced visual understanding and audio recognition capabilities through several critical and effective improvements over mainstream baselines. Moreover, we rethink inter-modal relationships during omni-modal training, emphasizing cross-modal alignment with video as a central bridge, and propose a progressive training pipeline that begins with the most distinct modalities and gradually moves towards closer modality alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field. Model weights, code, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola.</description>

      <title>Can't See the Forest for the Trees: Benchmarking Multimodal Safety Awareness for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded the capabilities of traditional language models by enabling interaction through both text and images. However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe-a capability we term safety awareness. In this paper, we introduce MMSafeAware, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. MMSafeAware includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using MMSafeAware reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore three methods to improve safety awareness-prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning-but find that none achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings highlight the profound challenges in developing MLLMs with robust safety awareness, underscoring the need for further research in this area. All the code and data will be publicly available to facilitate future research.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have serious security vulnerabilities.While safety alignment using multimodal datasets consisting of text and data of additional modalities can effectively enhance MLLM's security, it is costly to construct these datasets. Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/ZeroNLP/SEA.</description>
