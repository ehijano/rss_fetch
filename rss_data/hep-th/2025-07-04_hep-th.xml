      <title>Growth of block diagonal operators and symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses how the growth of invariant operators is influenced by their underlying symmetry structure. For this purpose, we introduce the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity, which captures the time evolution of each block into which an operator, invariant under a given symmetry, can be decomposed. We find that, at early times, the complexity of the full operator is equal to the average of the symmetry-resolved contributions. At later times, however, the interplay among different charge sectors becomes more intricate. In general, the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity depends on the charge sector, although in some cases this dependence disappears, leading to a form of Krylov complexity equipartition. Our analysis lays the groundwork for a broader application of symmetry structures in the study of Krylov space complexities with implications for thermalization and universality in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>An M-theory dS maximum from Casimir energies on Riemann-flat manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of flux compactifications on non-supersymmetric Riemann-flat manifolds (RFM's) with Casimir energy. While curvature and other corrections are suppressed in RFM's, the inclusion of Casimir energies allows one to evade standard dS no-go theorems, and the absence of orientifolds or other singular sources means that the construction is completely captured by ten or eleven-dimensional supergravity. We obtain a fully explicit formula for the Casimir stress-energy in a general RFM, including its ten or eleven-dimensional profile. The Casimir energy localizes in particular loci of the RFM, which we call "Casimir branes". The tension of Casimir branes sometimes cancels exactly, due to a spacetime analog of worldsheet Atkin-Lehner symmetry. We use Casimir energies to construct an explicit $dS_5$ maximum solution of a flux compactification of M-theory on a specific 6-dimensional RFM. The resulting solution is scale-separated, has a vacuum energy of $10^{-15}$ in five-dimensional Planck units, the Hubble radius is $10^7$ Planck lengths, and the light fields have masses of order $H^2$. This is a fully explicit, top-down de Sitter maximum in M-theory, with precisely computable vacuum energy. While the solution is not parametric, it is under extraordinary control: higher derivative and loop corrections to the vacuum energy are suppressed in powers of a small parameter $\delta V/V\sim 10^{-10}$, and M2 and M5-brane instantons are negligible. In short, the solution survives all known corrections. Nevertheless, it might be sensitive to more exotic ones, such as e.g. loops of 11d Planckian virtual black holes if there were a large enough number of them. We also extend the Ewald numerical method for lattice sums to arbitrary dimensions and develop an efficient numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation as an open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reinterpret Starobinsky's stochastic inflation as an open quantum system, where short-wavelength modes act as the environment for long-wavelength modes. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we systematically trace out the environment and derive an effective theory for the reduced density matrix, including deviations from exact de Sitter. The resulting master equation is a Lindblad equation, which reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation for the diagonal elements up to higher orders in the slow-roll expansion, while also yielding a more complete equation in phase space. Finally, we extend the formalism to global de Sitter, for which the associated Fokker-Planck equation lacks equilibrium solutions until the late-time regime $aH \gg 1$.</description>

      <title>Examining the Anomalous Nature of Chiral Effects in Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalies give rise to novel transport phenomena, including the generation of a current in a relativistic fluid due to the presence of magnetic field or vorticity. We present an exclusive and direct computation of the chiral anomaly within the path integral for a massless fermion on a generic electromagnetic and curved background, including local temperature and chemical potential. We identify new thermodynamical contributions to the anomaly which induce the Chiral Separation and Vortical Effects. Additionally, we show that the anomaly fully vanishes at global equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Applied Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetry is one of the most important and indispensable ingredients of modern theoretical physics. However, the absence, at least at the time of publishing this review, of experimental verification of supersymmetry in elementary particle/high-energy physics casts doubt on the viability of this concept at the energies achievable at the LHC. The more unexpected are either already experimentally verified or proposed for verification manifestations of supersymmetry at the level of low (condensed matter physics, quantum optics) and medium (nuclear physics) energies where standard quantum mechanics works. Using examples of various systems from completely different areas of physics, we discuss the isospectrality of quantum Hamiltonians, hidden and explicit supersymmetry, the advantages of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics approach and its role in quantum engineering.</description>

      <title>Adjusting Higher Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in formulating higher Chern-Simons theories is the construction of a consistent higher gauge theory that circumvents the fake-flatness constraint. Here, we propose a solution to this problem using adjusted higher connections. In particular, we shall demonstrate that there is an obstruction to constructing such action functionals since, generically, adjusted higher gauge algebras do not admit an inner product. To overcome this obstruction, we introduce half-adjusted higher Chern-Simons theories. These theories have both well-defined underlying kinematic data as well as the expected properties of a higher generalisation of Chern-Simons theory. We develop the general construction of these theories in arbitrary dimensions and provide explicit details for the four-dimensional case. We also present the complete differential cohomological framework for principal 2-bundles with half-adjusted connections. Finally, we discuss an alternative approach introducing additional trivial symmetries.</description>

      <title>Inflation Model Based on Virasoro Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for realizing slow-roll inflation that is fully consistent with observational data, based on conformal transformations acting exclusively on a complex scalar field -- without coupling to the gravitational sector. These transformations generically produce a plateau in the inflaton potential, as guaranteed by the maximum modulus theorem, thereby naturally satisfying the slow-roll conditions.
  Our framework utilizes squeezing operations generated by the Virasoro algebra without central extension, as developed in our earlier work. The resulting inflationary potentials depend on the Virasoro mode $n$, the power $m$ of the original potential, and the squeezing parameter $\theta$.
  We present approximate analytical expressions at leading order for the special case $n=-2$, and perform numerical analyses for both $n=-2$ and other values of $n$. These reveal parameter regimes in which the predicted cosmological observables $(n_{s},r)$ align remarkably well with current CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry-breaking compactifications on Riemann-flat manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider compactifications of higher-dimensional supergravities on Riemann-flat manifolds of dimension d ($3 \le d \le 7$) that fully break supersymmetry at the classical level on a resulting D-dimensional Minkowski space. We systematically discuss consistency conditions, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum and harmonics, and the resulting one-loop effective potential $V_1$, focusing for illustration on maximal supergravity and d=3, in particular on the $T^3/Z_3$ and on the Hantzsche-Wendt manifolds. We show how the KK spectrum is organized in multiplets of the broken supersymmetry, derive new universal supertrace mass relations valid at each KK level and obtain an analytic finite expression for $V_1$ after resumming the contributions of all KK levels. In all examples $V_1$ is negative definite and scales with inverse powers of some internal radii. We extensively comment, when applicable, on the relation with the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and with supersymmetry-breaking string compactifications on freely acting symmetric orbifolds. We also finally clarify the assumptions and constraints for Scherk-Schwarz reductions to correspond to twisted tori compactifications.</description>

      <title>On discrete gauging and non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify selection rules of conjugacy classes of several finite discrete groups where we deal with both gauged and ungauged cases. We find that the selection rules enjoy finite Abelian or non-Abelian discrete symmetries originating from the inner and/or outer automorphism of underlying discrete groups. Since the selection rules of conjugacy classes do not obey conventional group-like selection rules, they open up new coupling selection rules of fields which are labeled by the conjugacy classes.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping periodic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic structures are ubiquitous in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theories, ranging from lattice models, compact spaces, to topological phenomena. However, previous bootstrap studies encountered technical challenges even for one-body periodic problems, such as a failure in determining the accurate dispersion relations for Bloch bands. In this work, we develop a new bootstrap procedure to resolve these issues, which does not make use of positivity constraints. We mainly consider a quantum particle in a periodic cosine potential. The same procedure also applies to a particle on a circle, where the role of the Bloch momentum $k$ is played by the boundary condition or the $\theta$ angle. We unify the natural set of operators and the translation operator by a new set of operators $\{e^{inx} e^{iap} p^s\}$. To extract the Bloch momentum $k$, we further introduce a set of differential equations for $\langle{e^{inx} e^{iap} p^s}\rangle$ in the translation parameter $a$. At some fixed $a$, the boundary conditions can be determined accurately by analytic bootstrap techniques and matching conditions. After solving the differential equations, we impose certain reality conditions to determine the accurate dispersion relations, as well as the $k$ dependence of other physical quantities. We also investigate the case of noninteger $s$ using the Weyl integral in fractional calculus.</description>

      <title>Stringy Corrections to Heterotic SU(3)-Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the $\alpha'^2$ corrections to the supersymmetry algebra constructed by Bergshoeff de Roo for heterotic compactifications on SU(3) manifolds. The geometry remains complex, conformally balanced, but H and the hermitian form $\omega$ are corrected to $H = i(\partial - \bar\partial)\omega + \alpha' P$, with P determined in terms of dH. The supersymmetry algebra is integrable if and only if the graviton equation of motion is corrected, though the correction is pure gauge. We derive the same condition independently from hermitian geometry. The curvature of the tangent bundle connection acquires a nonzero (0,2) component with its trace fixed in terms of dH.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical properties of back reacted thermal plasma with finite 't Hooft coupling correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, holographic approach has been used to analyse the hydrodynamical properties of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills thermal plasma with subleading 't Hooft coupling correction and flavour quarks dual to the AdS Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of string cloud. The drag exerted on an external probe quark while translating through the thermal plasma enhances with probe velocity, flavour quark density, temperature and finite coupling correction. The jet quenching parameter gets enhanced on increase of flavour quark density, temperature and finite coupling correction. Quark-antiquark screening length is observed to reduce with rapidity parameter, flavour quark density, finite coupling correction and temperature which suggests an early transition to the thermal plasma phase of QGP. The screening length is found to be larger for the parallel orientation compared to the perpendicular configuration. Finally, the rotational dynamics of the heavy probe quark is studied. The rotational and drag energy loss increases with angular frequency and quark density, but is almost independent of the 't Hooft coupling.</description>

      <title>Trans-series from condensates in the non-linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide a massless perturbative framework for the two dimensional non-linear sigma model (NLSM), that allows the computation of the perturbative series attached to the operator condensates in the operator product expansion (OPE). It is based on a limit of the quartic linear sigma model (LSM) and is manifestly $O(N)$ symmetric. We show, at next-to-leading order in the $1/N$ expansion, how this framework reproduces the perturbative contribution to the two-point function, as well as its first exponentially small correction due to the condensate of the Lagrangian operator, in full agreement with the exact non-perturbative large $N$ solution. We also show that, in the full LSM, the physics at the natural UV cutoff indeed decouples from the NLSM in the IR, in the weak-coupling limit. In particular, we show that the perturbative framework for the LSM at the cutoff scale is connected to the one in the NLSM. The structure of power divergences in the LSM regularization also reveals that the first renormalon on the positive Borel axis of the NLSM perturbative self-energy is an UV renormalon, which cancels against the ambiguity in the condensate.</description>

      <title>Classification of $f(R)$ Theories Of Inflation And The Uniqueness of Starobinsky Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify $f(R)$ theories using a mathematical analogy between slow-roll inflation and the renormalization-group flow. We derive the power spectra and spectral indices class by class and compare them with the latest data. The framework used for the classification allows us to determine the general structure of the $f(R)$ functions that belong to each class. Our main result is that only two classes survive. Moreover, we show that the Starobinsky model is the only polynomial $f(R)$ that can realize slow-roll inflation. In fact, all other polynomials belong to a special class that can only realize constant-roll inflation, at least far enough in the past. We point out some of the issues involved in considering a smooth transition between constant-roll and slow-roll inflation in this class of models. Finally, we derive the map that transforms the results from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holography and entropy bounds suggest that the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs of gravitational effective theories are related to one another as a form of UV/IR mixing. Motivated by this, we derive a bound on the allowed scalar field range in theories with cosmic horizons. We show how this bound challenges several inflationary scenarios, such as $\alpha$-attractors and modular-invariant inflation. Besides, we find a relation between the number of extra spatial dimensions and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

Abstract: We propose a purely group-theoretical method for describing the S-matrix in quantum field theory with dynamical symmetry. In this approach, the Heisenberg S-matrix in a QFT with dynamical symmetry is an intertwining operator between unitary representations of the underlining dynamical group acting in Hilbert spaces spanned by the 'in' and 'out' states. As application we consider scalar Euclidean QFT with conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Stability of non-supersymmetric vacua from calibrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric vacua are protected from vacuum decay by energy positivity. No such argument is known for any non-supersymmetric vacua. In this paper, we try to extend to the latter a simpler argument based on calibrations, to at least protect them from decays mediated by D-brane bubbles, including their abelian bound states. We examine several classes of AdS$_4$ and AdS$_5$ solutions in type II string theory, including some new ones, involving coset spaces, sphere fibrations, K\"ahler--Einstein manifolds. Many of these vacua have resisted against all the decay channels we were able to assess. We also show how to use calibrations for the stability of D-branes already present in a non-supersymmetric solution.</description>

      <title>Trace Formulas for Deformed W-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate trace formulas in $\varepsilon$-deformed W-algebras, highlighting a novel connection to the modular double of $q$-deformed W-algebras. In particular, we show that torus correlators in the additive (Yangian) setting reproduce sphere correlators in the trigonometric setup, possibly with the inclusion of a non-perturbative completion. From a dual perspective, this mechanism implements a gauge theoretic 2d$\to$3d uplift, where a circle direction in the world-sheet transmutes to a compact space-time direction in a non-trivial manner. We further discuss a unified picture of deformed W-algebras driven by trace formulas, suggesting a deeper algebraic layer related to the massive and massless form-factor approach to integrable QFT and 2d CFT.</description>

      <title>Early time hydrodynamic attractor in a nearly-unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractors paradigm aims to explain fast applicability of hydrodynamics at ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC in terms of the emergence of a universal behaviour across different initial states. The attractors observed in theoretical models are first driven by a rapid expansion of matter, which later gives way to the decay of exponentially damped transient excitations into the viscous fluid regime. Recently a theoretical proposal was made how to realize hydrodynamic attractors in cold atomic gases focusing on the decay of transients and opening prospects for a future experimental realization in table top experiments. Motivated by this, in the present paper we show how the far-from-equilibrium, expansion-driven part of the hydrodynamic attractor emerges in a model of a nearly-unitary Fermi gas dynamics under full theoretical control.</description>

      <title>Spacetime symmetry-enriched SymTFT: from LSM anomalies to modulated symmetries and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework beyond internal symmetries by including geometric data that encode spacetime symmetries. Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by spacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological (SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal symmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in 1+1D. To this end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of 2+1D SETs affect the enriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and detecting anomalies of the 1+1D symmetry, as well as to classifying 1+1D symmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly construct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice translations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations, the interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations permuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a foliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify modulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For reflection and time-reversal symmetries, the interplay can additionally be encoded by symmetry fractionalization data in the SymTFT, and we identify mixed anomalies and study gauging for such examples.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Perturbations on Arbitrary Black Hole Backgrounds with Spacelike Scalar Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the effective field theory (EFT) of perturbations in the context of scalar-tensor theories with a spacelike scalar profile on arbitrary black hole backgrounds. Our construction of the EFT is based on the fact that in the unitary gauge, where the scalar field is chosen as one of the spatial coordinates, the background scalar field spontaneously breaks the diffeomorphism invariance along the direction of its gradient. The residual symmetry on a timelike hypersurface of constant scalar field is referred to as the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphism invariance. We then derive a set of consistency relations, imposed on the EFT parameters, by requiring that the EFT action in the unitary gauge be invariant under the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphisms. For concreteness, we apply the EFT to study the background dynamics of a class of non-static and spherically symmetric solutions, focusing in particular on a black hole solution with a time-varying mass. We emphasize that our EFT framework is broadly applicable to any black hole background as long as the scalar field remains spacelike throughout the spacetime region of interest. This formulation provides a model-independent approach for testing scalar-tensor theories as gravity beyond general relativity in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <title>ACT-Inspired Kaehler-Based Inflationary Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new class of cosmological attractors which are compatible with the recent ACT results. They are based on two types of fractional Kaehler potentials, K, for a gauge-singlet inflaton phi which reduce, along the inflationary path, to the form N/(1-phi^qM)^p with qM=1, 2 and 0.1&lt; p&lt;10. The combination of these K's with the chaotic potentials phi^n (where n=2, 4) within a non-linear sigma model leads to inflationary observables which are consistent with the current data and largely independent from qM and n. Endowing these K's with a shift symmetry we also offer a supergravity realization of our models introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. The attainment of inflation with subplanckian inflaton values and the large values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which increases with N, are two additional attractive features of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Einstein-Maxwell-phantom spacetime: Instabilities of charged Ellis wormholes and quasinormal modes of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phantom scalar fields, as a viable candidate for dark energy, have been instrumental in eliminating spacetime singularities and constructing wormholes and regular black holes. We investigate the Einstein-Maxwell-phantom (EMP) framework, in which the Ellis wormholes can be charged and regular black holes can be admitted. While the previous study has shown the stability of EMP wormholes under massless scalar field perturbations, we further perform a comprehensive linear analysis of the EMP spacetime through phantom scalar field perturbations and gravito-electromagnetic field perturbations. Our analyses of effective potentials and finite difference time profiles reveal the linear instability of EMP wormholes. In the black hole scenario, the quasinormal spectra of the EMP theory, where the matrix-valued direct integration method and the Prony method are used, recover those of general relativity when the scalar charge goes to zero. By introducing the concepts of generalized specific charge and mixing angle, we quantify how the relative contributions between the phantom scalar and the electromagnetic fields produce distinct modifications in the quasinormal spectra.</description>

      <title>Coupling Electromagnetism to Torsion: Black Holes and Spin-Charge Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between matter fields and gravity (encoded in the geometry of spacetime) can be realized in various ways. Most commonly, a minimal coupling principle is employed, meaning that all matter fields, except spinors, couple only to the spacetime metric, while spinors additionally couple to the spacetime connection. Non-minimal couplings between matter fields and spacetime curvature can arise, for example, from quantum field theory on curved spacetime through renormalization corrections, in gauge theories of gravity, and in effective field theories. In this article, we consider a non-minimal coupling $F^{\mu\nu}\tilde{R}{\mu\nu}$ between the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field $F{\mu\nu}$ and the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor $\tilde{R}_{[\mu\nu]}$ in Riemann-Cartan geometry, which is based on a general metric-compatible connection with torsion. We find an exact 4-dimensional vacuum solution that generalizes the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole from Einstein-Maxwell and reveals new interactions between the intrinsic torsion-spin charge and the electric charge. Qualitatively, this solution exhibits two distinct features: the effective charge is not constrained to be positive, and the sign of the electric charge influences its gravitational effects. We also derive slowly rotating solutions in 3 dimensions, representing a generalized slowly rotating BTZ black hole solution with couplings among the magnetic and electric charges, the angular momentum, and the intrinsic torsion-spin charge.</description>

Abstract: We derive the chiral kinetic theory in a non-Abelian gauge field using a self-consistent semiclassical expansion. Within this new expansion scheme, we disentangle the Wigner equations up to second order and demonstrate that they do not introduce additional constraint equations. By integrating the covariant chiral kinetic equations in eight-dimensional phase space, we obtain the corresponding equations in seven-dimensional phase space. This reduction facilitates numerical simulations and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological production of scalar, non-minimally coupled dark matter depends on the specifics of the inflationary model under consideration. We analyze both Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic potential, solve the full background dynamics, study pair production during inflation and reheating, and find that the observed dark matter abundance can be explained solely by this mechanism, regardless of the inflationary model. Qualitative differences between the two cases only appear for dark matter masses close to the inflationary scale. In addition, we identify a large region in parameter space in which cosmological production of dark matter is mostly independent of the chosen inflationary potential, highlighting the robustness of this dark matter production mechanism and its independence of the unknown particular details of inflation. In the region of masses lower than the scale of inflation, and sufficiently away from the conformal limit, the total comoving number density of produced particles becomes a function of the coupling to the geometry alone. This allows us to provide an approximated analytic expression for fitting the resulting abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most theories that attempt to reproduce the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology for dark matter at galactic scales rely on ad hoc free functions, preventing them from being regarded as fundamental. In this work, we present a new theory that reproduces MOND, built on a supposed to be fundamental Yang-Mills gauge field based on SU(2), with a gravitational coupling constant, and emerging in a low-acceleration regime, below the MOND acceleration scale. The gauge field plays the role of the internal force in the dipolar dark matter (DDM) model. We discuss how certain solutions of this theory recover the deep MOND regime without introducing arbitrary functions in the action. Within this framework, the MOND phenomenology appears to be due to the existence of a new sector of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Axion USR Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of inflation in which the inflaton field is a rolling axion with a potential which is flat enough to support an intermediate phase of USR inflation. Because of the Chern-Simons interaction, one polarization of the gauge field experiences the tachyonic growth during the first slow-roll stage, inducing large corrections in curvature perturbations via the inverse decay effect. A non-trivial feature of our setup is that once the system enters the USR phase, the instability parameter falls off rapidly, terminating the gauge field production efficiently. Consequently, the power spectrum involves two separate peaks, the first peak is induced by the gauge field particles production while the second peak is due to standard USR mechanism. We show that the power spectrum at the intermediate scales develops strong scale-dependence $\propto k^m$ with the index $m &gt;4$. Calculating the bispectrum, we demonstrate that non-Gaussianities with non-trivial shapes and multiple peaks are generated in this setup.</description>

      <title>A Note on Chaos in Hayward Black Holes with String Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the onset of thermodynamic chaos in Hayward AdS black holes with string fluids, emphasizing the effects of temporal and spatially periodic perturbations. We apply Melnikov's approach to examine the perturbed Hamiltonian dynamics and detect the onset of chaotic behavior within the spinodal regime of the $(P-v)$ plot. In the case of temporal perturbations induced by thermal quenches, chaos occurs for perturbation amplitude $\gamma$ exceeding a critical threshold that can be determined by charge $q$ and the string fluid parameter. From the equation of state of the black hole, a general condition can be established indicating that under temporal perturbations, the existence of charge is an essential prerequisite for chaos. In this regime, neutral Hayward black holes do not exhibit chaotic dynamics. However, regardless of the presence of charge, spatial perturbations result in chaotic behavior. The nonlinear interplay between the regularized core geometry and string fluids drives the formation of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits in phase space, validating the persistence of chaos. The results obtained in this work, highlights the role of nonlinear matter fields and curvature regularization mechanisms in governing thermodynamic instability and the onset of chaos in Hayward black holes in AdS.</description>

      <title>Dynamical-System analysis of single-axion monodromy inflation with periodically-modulated potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study field theoretic systems of a single axion-like field with linear potentials modulated by cosine terms, allegedly induced by non-perturbative instanton configurations. These systems are considered in expanding-Universe spacetime backgrounds (of Friedman-Lema$\hat{\rm i}$tre-Robertson-Walker type). Using a dynamical-system approach, we classify the various de-Sitter like (inflationary) vacua from the point of view of their stability, which depend on the values of the model parameters. In this respect, bifurcation points are found to be present for the various models under consideration. Part of the parameter space of the systems under consideration includes the running-vacuum (approximately) linear-axion monodromy potentials, considered in previous works by some of the authors, where inflation is induced by primordial gravitational-wave condensates. A particularly interesting case, corresponding to another part of the parameter space of the models, includes a series of stable de-Sitter vacua, which physically may correspond to a series of successive tunnelings of the system, via say non-perturbative effects, with a decreasing effective cosmological constant. Under certain values of the parameters, these successive tunnelings can reach a Minkowski spacetime, with zero value of the minimum of the axion potential. The situation is not dissimilar to the one of discrete inflation that arguably characterizes some minimal non-critical-string (Liouville) models of cosmology. Finally, for comparison, we also include in this article a dynamical-system study of standard axion-monodromy-modulated potentials characterizing some string/brane-compactification models of inflation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic accretion and burdened primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the joint effects of relativistic accretion and memory burdened evaporation on the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs). The memory burden effect, which delays the evaporation by inducing a backreaction and making the evaporation rate scale as an inverse power law of the PBH entropy, opens up a new window that allows PBHs with $M \lesssim 10^{15}~\mathrm{g}$ to survive until the present epoch. Meanwhile, accretion increases the mass of PBHs, thereby enhancing their chances of survival for a given initial mass. We consider two main scenarios: one where PBHs evaporate completely before big bang nucleosynthesis, and another where PBHs persist until today. In the case of evaporation, we analyse the emission of dark matter (DM) and dark radiation (DR) during the process of evaporation. Conversely, in the other case, the surviving PBHs themselves can contribute as DM. We further investigate how relativistic and non-relativistic accretion, together with memory burdened evaporation, impact the parameter space of the emitted DM, the abundance of stable PBHs as DM, and the contribution of DR to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$.</description>

      <title>Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</description>

      <title>Proof of a magnificent conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by super-Yang-Mills theory on a Calabi-Yau 4-fold, Nekrasov and Piazzalunga have assigned weights to $r$-tuples of solid partitions and conjectured a formula for their weighted generating function.
  We define $K$-theoretic virtual invariants of Quot schemes of 0-dimensional quotients of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^4}^{\oplus r}$ by realizing them as zero loci of isotropic sections of orthogonal bundles on non-commutative Quot schemes. Via the Oh-Thomas localization formula, we recover Nekrasov-Piazzalunga's weights and derive their sign rule.
  Our proof passes through refining the $K$-theoretic invariants to sheaves and describing them via Clifford modules, which lets us show that they arise from a factorizable sequence of sheaves in the sense of Okounkov. Taking limits of the equivariant parameters, we then deduce the Nekrasov-Piazzalunga conjecture from its 3-dimensional analog.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Superintegrability from Unitary Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some eigenvalue matrix models possess an interesting property: one can manifestly define the basis where all averages can be explicitly calculated. For example, in the Gaussian Hermitian and rectangular complex models, averages of the Schur functions are again expressed through the Schur functions. However, so far this property remains restricted to very particular (e.g. Gaussian) measures. In this paper, we extend this observation to unitary matrix integrals, where one could expect that this restriction is easier to lift. We demonstrate that this is indeed the case, only this time the Schur averages are linear combinations of the Schur functions. Full factorization to a single item in the sum appears only on the Miwa locus, where at least one half of the time-variables is expressed through matrices of the same size. For unitary integrals, this is a manifestation of the de Wit-t'Hooft anomaly, which prevents the answer to be fully analytic in the matrix size $N$. Once achieved, this understanding can be extended back to the Hermitian model, where the phenomenon looks very similar: beyond Gaussian measures superintegrability requires an additional summation.</description>

      <title>Connecting topological strings and spectral theory via non-autonomous Toda equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Topological String/Spectral theory duality on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from the resolution of the cone over the $Y^{N,0}$ singularity. Assuming Kyiv formula, we demonstrate this duality in a special regime thanks to an underlying connection between spectral determinants of quantum mirror curves and the non-autonomous (q)-Toda system. We further exploit this link to connect small and large time expansions in Toda equations. In particular we provide an explicit expression for their tau functions at large time in terms of a strong coupling version of irregular $W_N$ conformal blocks at $c=N-1$. These are related to a special class of multi-cut matrix models which describe the strong coupling regime of four dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra in ${\cal N}=1\, SU(N_c)$ SQCD with $N_F=N_c$ and problems with S-confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low energy mass spectra of the direct $SU(N_c)$, $\,N_F=N_c$ $\,{\cal N}=1$ SQCD theory and its N.Seiberg's dual variant [1], are calculated in sections 2 and 3. It is shown that these two mass spectra are parametrically different, both for equal or unequal small quark masses $m_{Q,i}\neq 0$.
  In [17] the very special non-SUSY lattice $SU(N_c)$ QCD theory with $N_F=N_c$ scalar defective "quarks" was considered by E.Fradkin and S.H.Shenker. The conclusion of [17] was that the transition between the confinement and higgs regimes in this theory is the analytic crossover, not the non-analytic phase transition. And although the theory considered in [17] was very specific, the experience shows that up to now there is a widely spread opinion that this conclusion has general applicability.
  This model used in [17] is criticized in section 5 of this paper as incompatible with and qualitatively different from the standard non-SUSY $SU(N_c)$ $N_F=N_c$ QCD theory with standard scalar quarks $\phi^i_{\beta}$ with all their $2N^2_F$ real degrees of freedom. It is emphasized that this model [17] is really the Stuckelberg $SU(N_c)$ YM-theory with no dynamical electric quarks and with massive all $N_c^2-1$ electric gluons with fixed by hands nonzero masses. There is no genuine confinement in this theory, it stays permanently in the completely higgsed phase only. And this is a reason for a crossover in this theory. While in the theory with standard scalar quarks there is the phase transition between the confinement and higgs phases.
  Besides, in section 5, the arguments presented in [2] by K.Intriligator and N.Seiberg for the standard direct $SU(N_c)$, $N_F=N_c$ $\,{\cal N}=1$ SQCD in support of the crossover from [17] are criticized as erroneous.
  Besides, in section 5 a qualitative mechanism of confinement in our ordinary (i.e. not SUSY) QCD is proposed.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin, and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three, and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homology of three-manifolds -- and its novel Atiyah-Floer type correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

      <title>S-confinement of 3d Argyres-Douglas theories and the Seiberg-like duality with an adjoint matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an $\mathcal{N}=2$ preserving deformation that leads to the confining phase of the 3d reduction of the $D_p[SU(N)]$ Argyres-Douglas theories, referred to as $\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$. This deformation incorporates monopole superpotential terms, which have recently played interesting roles in exploring possible RG fixed points of 3d supersymmetric gauge theories. Employing this confining phenomenon in 3d $\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$ theories, we also propose a deconfined version of the Kim-Park duality, an IR duality for 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ adjoint SQCDs, where an adjoint matter field is replaced by a linear quiver tail of $\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$. Surprisingly, both the confinement of deformed $\mathbb{D}_p[SU(N)]$ and the deconfined Kim-Park duality can be proven only assuming some basic 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ IR dualities. Finally, we propose a variant of the Kim-Park duality deformed by a single monopole superpotential term, which can also be derived using the same method.</description>

Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. In the 8d case, one can also derive higher $A_{\infty}$-categories, such as a novel Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-3-category that 3-categorifies the Haydys-Witten Floer homology of four-manifolds via a 4d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the theory. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], our work furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3], Doan-Rezchikov [4], and Cao [5].</description>

      <title>Equivalence of spin-2 and spin-3 models invariant under transverse diffeomorphisms and the tensionless limit of string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we investigate a general class of massless local theories of spin-2 and spin-3 both invariant under generalized transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff). We identify the ghost free region in their parameters space and show the relationship of those models with the ``doublet'' action stemming from the tensionless limit of the open bosonic string field theory (for symmetric tensors). The connection is implemented via a non local field redefinition which introduces a Stuckelberg-like field of rank-0 (rank-1) for the spin-2 (spin-3) case. An apparent mismatch between most of the TDiff models and the ``doublet'' action has led us to prove a nontrivial duality within the TDiff models which restores the equivalence. Any point in the parameters subspace of ghost free TDiff models is equivalent to any other one within that subspace. In particular, they are all physically equivalent to their simplest version known as Maxwell-like models. So the physical TDiff models seem to differ from each other by a BRST cohomologically trivial term.</description>

      <title>Kac-Moody Algebras on Soft Group Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the so-called group geometric approach to (super)gravity and (super)string theories, any compact Lie group manifold $G_{c}$ can be smoothly deformed into a group manifold $G_{c}^{\mu }$ (locally diffeomorphic to $G_{c}$ itself), which is `soft', namely, based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein $\mu $, which violates the Maurer-Cartan equations and consequently has a non-vanishing associated curvature two-form. Within the framework based on the above deformation (`softening'), we show how to construct an infinite-dimensional (infinite-rank), generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to $G_{c}$. As an application, we consider KM algebras associated to deformed manifolds such as the `soft' circle, the `soft' two-sphere and the `soft' three-sphere. While the generalized KM algebra associated to the deformed circle is trivially isomorphic to its undeformed analogue, and hence not new, the `softening' of the two- and three- sphere includes squashed manifolds (and in particular, the so-called Berger three-sphere) and yields to non-trivial results.</description>

      <title>Multipoint conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Part I: Bipartite Mellin-Barnes representation and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic approach to calculating $n$-point one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions which we call the reconstruction procedure. It relies on decomposing a conformal integral over basis functions which are generated from a set of master functions by acting with the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. In order to identify the master functions we introduce a bipartite Mellin-Barnes representation by means of splitting a given conformal integral into two additive parts, one of which can be evaluated explicitly in terms of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series.
  For the box and pentagon integrals (i.e. $n=4,5$) we show that a computable part of the bipartite representation contains all master functions. In particular, this allows us to evaluate the parametric pentagon integral as a sum of ten basis functions generated from two master functions by the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_5$. The resulting expression can be tested in two ways. First, when one of propagator powers is set to zero, the pentagon integral is reduced to the known box integral, which is also rederived through the reconstruction procedure. Second, going to the non-parametric case, we reproduce the known expression for the pentagon integral given in terms of logarithms derived earlier within the geometric approach to calculating conformal integrals.
  We conclude by considering the hexagon integral ($n=6$) for which we show that those basis functions which follow from the computable part of the bipartite representation are not enough and more basis functions are required. In the second part of our project we will describe a method of constructing a complete set of master/basis functions in the $n$-point case.</description>

      <title>Symmetries Beyond Branes: Geometric Engineering and Isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the relation between finite isometries of the internal space and symmetries of the transverse field theory in Geometric Engineering. On top of the established relation between branes wrapping torsional cycles and topological defects, we study other symmetries of the field theory that are not captured by branes wrapped at infinity. Isometries of the engineering geometry have a representations on the field theory, encoded by their non-trivial actions on exceptional and torsional cycles. In this work we describe such action in general terms. As examples, we focus on three classes of geometric engineering spaces: Du Val singularities, toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and $G_2$ manifolds obtained as fibrations of Du Val singularities over $\mathbb S^3$. In the latter case, we check explicitly that M-theory on Calabi-Yau or $G_2$ manifold with finite isometries reproduces correctly the higher group structures and non-invertible symmetries of the transverse field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generic nonlinear theories of chiral 2-form electrodynamics allow superluminal propagation in some stationary homogeneous backgrounds and are therefore acausal. We find a simple parameterisation of the Hamiltonian for causal theories, and we use it to show that the stress-energy tensor satisfies both the Dominant and Strong energy conditions. We also revisit the Perry-Schwarz formulation, clarifying aspects of it and of its relation to the Hamiltonian formulation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of $F^4$-couplings in Heterotic/Type IIA Dual String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The M-theoretic emergence proposal claims that in an isotropic decompactification limit to M-theory the full effective action is generated via quantum effects by integrating out only the light towers of states of the theory. In the BPS particle sector, these include transversally wrapped $M2$- and $M5$-branes possibly carrying Kaluza-Klein momentum. This implies that a longitudinally wrapped $M5$-brane, i.e. a wrapped $D4$-brane, is not to be included in emergence computations. In this work we collect explicit evidence supporting this point by examining an $F^4$ gauge coupling in six dimensions, making use of the duality between heterotic string theory on $T^4$ and strongly coupled type IIA on K3. In this instance, the M-theoretic emergence proposal can be viewed as a tool for making predictions for the microscopic behavior of string theoretic amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Graviton stimulated emission in squeezed vacuum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state under a thermal radiation background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ the Heisenberg equation and average it over general quantum states. In contrast to the usual Boltzmann-based descriptions, our approach captures the subtleties arising from quantum coherence in different number eigenstates, which is essential for soft graviton modes in the squeezed vacuum state. Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results within the in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates significantly as the parameter increases, indicating that our results extend beyond the one-loop in-in formalism. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. In the flat background, it is found that backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission. In the expanding background, to avoid the subtleties associated with superhorizon modes, we investigate the effect of emission within the horizon immediately after reheating and find a significant effect. We also examined the IR graviton evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the secular growth problem.</description>

      <title>A Chiral-Planar dualization algorithm for 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a broad class of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ chiral Chern-Simons gauge theories admit an abelian and planar dual description. These chiral-planar dualities emerge by performing real mass deformations on known $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror pairs, using the $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ setup to flow to chiral theories on the electric side. While identifying the correct dual vacuum is subtle due to the rich structure of the Coulomb branch, we develop a mirror dualization algorithm that streamlines this process and systematically provides the abelian-planar duals of chiral quivers.</description>

      <title>Correlators in non-conformal $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories from localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-point correlation functions of chiral/anti-chiral operators in SU(N) $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories with massless hyper-multiplets in a representation $\mathcal{R}$ associated with a non-vanishing $\beta$-function. Using supersymmetric localization on the four-sphere $S^4$, these observables can be evaluated by matrix correlators of normal ordered operators. We show that, within a specific regime of validity, standard perturbative calculations based on Feynman diagrams and renormalization procedures in flat space perfectly match the localization predictions up to two loops generalizing and extending previous results. Our analysis highlights that non-trivial interference effects between evanescent terms and the UV poles of the bare coupling are essential for the agreement. On the matrix model side, we employ a direct diagrammatic procedure akin to the Feynman diagram expansion on the field theory description; this simplifies the comparison for generic operators and general matter representation $\mathcal{R}$.</description>

      <title>Twisted-Circle Compactifications of SQCD-like Theories and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and analyse holographic duals to a class of four-dimensional N = 1 SU($N_c$) SQCD-like theories compactified on a circle with an R-symmetry twist. The setup originates from type IIB backgrounds previously proposed as duals to SQCD with $N_f$ fundamental flavours. The U(1) R-symmetry is anomaly-free only if $ N_f = 2N_c$. We implement a supersymmetric twisted-circle reduction, holographically realised through a smoothly shrinking $S^1$ fibered over the internal U(1)$_R$ direction. We obtain new regular type IIB supergravity backgrounds that are valid only if the condition $N_f = 2N_c$ is satisfied--mirroring the anomaly cancellation requirement in the field theory. We compute various field-theoretic observables--including the Chern-Simons level, Wilson loop and the holographic central charge--showing the emergence of a 3D ${\cal N} = 2$ gapped phase consistent with a Chern-Simons TQFT. This work highlights the interplay between anomalies, supersymmetry, and geometry in the holographic realisation of compactified gauge theories with fundamental matter.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions from integrability in $\mathcal{N}=2$ orbifold theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides solving the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, integrability also provides us with tools to compute the structure constants of the theory, most prominently through the hexagon formalism. We show that, with minor modifications, this formalism can also be applied to orbifolds of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, which are integrable theories in their own right. To substantiate this claim, we test our results against a direct gauge-theory calculation at tree-level. We focus here on a family of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $\mathbb{Z}_M$-orbifold theories. BPS correlators in these theories have recently been investigated with independent localisation techniques and a tentative matching with wrapping corrections in the hexagon formalism was observed. Together with our weak-coupling evidence, this suggests that a full determination of the structure constants of orbifold theories at finite coupling may be within reach.</description>

      <title>Optical effects in unmagnetized cold plasmas by a chiral axion factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmagnetized cold plasma modes are investigated in the context of the chiral Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCJF) electrodynamics, where the axion chiral factor acts retrieving some typical properties of magnetized plasmas. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive indices, and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices modified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic conductivity chiral parameter role associated with right-circularly polarized (RCP) and left-circularly polarized (LCP) waves. For each refractive index, the propagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some specific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the low-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the chiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power (RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The negative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP sign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas. Charge density oscillations and Langmuir waves are also discussed, revealing no modified dispersion relation due to the chiral axion factor.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes (as Dark Matter) from the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the production of primordial black holes (PBHs), as well as their mass and initial spin, due to the phase transitions corresponding to radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) and featuring a large supercooling. The latter property allows us to use a model-independent approach. In this context, we demonstrate that the decay rate of the false vacuum grows exponentially with time to a high degree of accuracy, justifying a time dependence commonly assumed in the literature. Our study provides ready-to-use results for determining the abundance, mass and initial spin of PBHs generated in a generic RSB model with large supercooling. We find that PBHs are generically produced in a broad region of the model-independent parameter space. As an application, we identify the subregion that may explain recently reported microlensing anomalies. Additionally, we show that a simple Standard-Model extension, with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ featuring RSB, may explain an anomaly of this sort in a region of its parameter space.</description>

      <title>Casimir Radial Parts via Matsuki Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Matsuki's decomposition for symmetric pairs $(G, H)$ of (not necessarily compact) reductive Lie groups to construct the radial parts for invariant differential operators acting on matrix-spherical functions. As an application, we employ this machinery to formulate an alternative, mathematically rigorous approach to obtaining radial parts of Casimir operators that appear in the theory of conformal blocks, which avoids poorly defined analytical continuations from the compact quotient cases. To exemplify how this works, after reviewing the presentation of conformal 4-point correlation functions via matrix-spherical functions for the corresponding symmetric pair, we for the first time provide a complete analysis of the Casimir radial part decomposition in the case of Lorentzian signature. As another example, we revisit the Casimir reduction in the case of conformal blocks for two scalar defects of equal dimension. We argue that Matsuki's decomposition thus provides a proper mathematical framework for analysing the correspondence between Casimir equations and the Calogero-Sutherland-type models, first discovered by one of the authors and Schomerus.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Reflection Signatures of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary signatures and the feasibility of identifying them through X-ray reflection spectra. The X-ray emitting region is modeled as a set of two mini-disks bound to the individual SMBHs separated by 100 $GM/c^2$ and the spectra calculated as a function of the mass, mass ratio, and total accretion rate of the binary. The X-ray reflection features are strongly influenced by the accretion-inversion phenomenon expected in SMBH binaries, which results in a wide range of ionization conditions in the two mini-disks. These are imprinted in the resulting composite spectra and the double-peaked and time-variable relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles. To test whether these features can be used as evidence for the presence of an SMBH binary, we fit mock 100 ks observations with a single AGN model. For a $10^9$ $M_\odot$ binary targeted by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), at $z=0.1$ the single AGN model clearly fails to fit the data, while at $z=1$ the fit is acceptable but unable to converge on the SMBH spin. For a $10^6$ $M_\odot$ binary, a progenitor of a Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) source, spectral fitting is only possible at $z=0.1$, with the outcomes similar to the PTA binary at $z=1$. We also find that PTA binaries can be expected to show a distinct X-ray spectral variability in multi-epoch observations, whereas for LISA precursors, orbital averaging results in the loss of spectral variability signatures.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent Year-2 data release of the DESI collaboration, we update our results on time-varying dark energy models driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound. The previously found preference of time-dependent dark energy models compared to $\Lambda$CDM is further strengthend by the new data release. For our particular models, we find that this preference increases up to $\approx 2.6\,\sigma$ depending on the used supernova dataset.</description>

      <title>Ill-posedness of the Cauchy problem for linearized gravity in a cavity with conformal boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Lorentzian General Relativity in a cavity with a timelike boundary, with conformal boundary conditions and also a generalization of these boundary conditions. We focus on the linearized gravitational dynamics about the static empty cavity whose boundary has spherical spatial geometry. It has been recently shown that there exist dynamical instabilities, whose angular dependence is given in terms of spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}$, and whose coefficient of exponential growth in time goes as $\sim \ell^{1/3}$. We use these modes to construct a sequence of solutions for which the initial data converge to zero as $\ell \rightarrow \infty$ but for which the solution itself does not converge to zero. This implies a lack of continuity of solutions on initial data, which shows that the initial value problem with these boundary conditions is not well-posed. This is in tension with recent mathematical work on well-posedness for such boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We summarize recent work showing that the $1/r^2$ model of interacting particles in 1-dimension is a universal Hamiltonian for quantum chaotic systems. The problem is analyzed in terms of random matrices and of the evolution of their eigenvalues under changes of parameters. The robustness of bulk space-time correlations of a many particle system to changing boundary conditions is suggested to be at the root of the universality. The explicit density-density correlation functions of the $1/r^2$ model, now available through the above mapping at two values of the coupling constant, are interpreted in the light of Bethe's {\it Ansatz}, giving a vivid picture of the fractionalization of bare particles or holes into ``quark'' like Bethe quasi-particles and holes.</description>
