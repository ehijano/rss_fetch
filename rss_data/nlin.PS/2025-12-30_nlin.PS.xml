      <title>Discrete equations and auto-traveling kinks of the $\phi^6$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\phi^{6}$ model and derive two broad classes of lattice discretizations that admit static, translationally invariant kinks; that is, stationary kink profiles that can be centered at an arbitrary position relative to the lattice. These discretizations are constructed using a one-dimensional map, $\phi_{n+1}=F(\phi_{n})$, which provides a direct and systematic algorithm for generating such models. Numerical computations for two representative cases show that the discrete kinks do not possess internal modes, consistent with the continuum theory, although an additional high-frequency mode may appear above the phonon band. We also show that generic discretizations of the $\phi^{6}$ model do not support static kink solutions. Instead, the resulting dynamics produce auto-traveling and self-accelerating kinks that propagate at the maximal group velocity while continuously emitting radiation.</description>

      <title>amangkurat: A Python Library for Symplectic Pseudo-Spectral Solution of the Idealized (1+1)D Nonlinear Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces amangkurat, an open-source Python library designed for the robust numerical simulation of relativistic scalar field dynamics governed by the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in $(1+1)$D spacetime. The software implements a hybrid computational strategy that couples Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization with a symplectic St\o rmer-Verlet temporal integrator, ensuring both exponential spatial convergence for smooth solutions and long-term preservation of Hamiltonian structure. To optimize performance, the solver incorporates adaptive timestepping based on Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability criteria and utilizes Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for parallelized force computation. The library's capabilities are validated across four canonical physical regimes: dispersive linear wave propagation, static topological kink preservation in phi-fourth theory, integrable breather dynamics in the sine-Gordon model, and non-integrable kink-antikink collisions. Beyond standard numerical validation, this work establishes a multi-faceted analysis framework employing information-theoretic entropy metrics (Shannon, R\'{e}nyi, and Tsallis), kernel density estimation, and phase space reconstruction to quantify the distinct phenomenological signatures of these regimes. Statistical hypothesis testing confirms that these scenarios represent statistically distinguishable dynamical populations. Benchmarks on standard workstation hardware demonstrate that the implementation achieves high computational efficiency, making it a viable platform for exploratory research and education in nonlinear field theory.</description>

      <title>Quasi-continuum descriptions of rarefaction and dispersive shock waves in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattices with Hertzian potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we review two well-established quasi-continuum models of a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice with Hertzian type potentials, and utilize these two models to approximate the discrete dispersive shock waves (DDSWs) which are numerically observed in the simulation of the lattice. To perform analysis on the various characteristics of the DDSW, we analytically derive the Whitham modulation equations of the two quasi-continuum models, which govern the slowly varying spatial and temporal dynamics of distinct parameters of the periodic solutions. We then perform a very useful reduction of the Whitham modulation system to gain a system of initial-value problems whose solutions can provide important insights on edge features of the DSWs such as their edge speeds. In addition, we also study the numerical rarefaction waves (RWs) of the lattice based on the two quasi-continuum models. In particular, we analytically compute and compare their self-similar solutions with the numerical discrete RW of the lattice. These comparisons made for both DSWs and RWs reveal to be reasonably good, which suggest the impressive performance of both quasi-continuum models.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for a complex scalar field under discrete symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the presence of families of exact solutions for a complex scalar field that behaves according to the rules of discrete $Z_N$ symmetry. Since the family of models is exactly solved, the results appear to be of interest to integrability, to build junctions and networks of localized structures and to describe scalar dark matter in high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Virial Identities: Radial Constraints for Solitons, Instantons, and Bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological solitons and tunneling configurations (monopoles, vortices, Skyrmions, sphalerons, and bounces) are characterized by profile functions that encode their physical properties. Derrick's scaling relation provides a global integral constraint on these profiles, but reveals nothing about the local balance between kinetic and potential contributions in different regions. We derive a continuous family of virial identities for O($n$) symmetric configurations, parameterized by an exponent $\alpha$ that controls the radial weighting: negative $\alpha$ emphasizes the core where topological boundary conditions are imposed, large positive $\alpha$ emphasizes the asymptotic tail, and $\alpha = 1$ recovers the classical Derrick relation. The family provides a systematic decomposition of the global constraint into radially-resolved components, with special $\alpha$ values isolating specific mechanisms. For BPS configurations, where the Bogomolny equations imply pointwise equality between kinetic and potential densities, the virial identity is satisfied for all valid $\alpha$. We verify the formalism analytically for the Fubini-Lipatov instanton, BPS monopole, and BPST instanton. Numerical tests on the Coleman bounce and Nielsen-Olesen vortex illustrate how the $\alpha$-dependence of errors distinguishes core from tail inaccuracies: the vortex shows errors growing at negative $\alpha$ (core), while the bounce shows errors growing at positive $\alpha$ (tail). Applications to the electroweak sphaleron, where the Higgs mass explicitly breaks scale invariance, and the hedgehog Skyrmion illustrate the formalism in systems with multiple competing length scales.</description>

      <title>Energetics-based model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a mathematical model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet, which is floating at a liquid surface and is driven by the surface tension gradient originating from the surface concentration field of the chemicals that are emitted from the droplet. We define the free energy of the system by including the surface and line energies. From the calculation of the functional of the free energy, we obtain a mathematical model for the diffusiophoretic motion with deformation. By only considering the deformation of the second mode, we explicitly derive the time-evolution equations for the translational motion and the elliptic deformation. There are three stable states: an immobile circular droplet, an immobile elliptically deformed droplet, and a moving droplet with the elliptic deformation in which the minor axis meets the motion direction, and we discuss the transition between these three stable states.</description>
