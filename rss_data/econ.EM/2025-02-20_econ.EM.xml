      <title>Locally Robust Policy Learning: Inequality, Inequality of Opportunity and Intergenerational Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy makers need to decide whether to treat or not to treat heterogeneous individuals. The optimal treatment choice depends on the welfare function that the policy maker has in mind and it is referred to as the policy learning problem. I study a general setting for policy learning with semiparametric Social Welfare Functions (SWFs) that can be estimated by locally robust/orthogonal moments based on U-statistics. This rich class of SWFs substantially expands the setting in Athey and Wager (2021) and accommodates a wider range of distributional preferences. Three main applications of the general theory motivate the paper: (i) Inequality aware SWFs, (ii) Inequality of Opportunity aware SWFs and (iii) Intergenerational Mobility SWFs. I use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to assess the effect of attending preschool on adult earnings and estimate optimal policy rules based on parental years of education and parental income.</description>

      <title>Robust Inference for the Direct Average Treatment Effect with Treatment Assignment Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in causal inference settings with random network interference is a challenging open problem. We study the large sample distributional properties of the classical difference-in-means Hajek treatment effect estimator, and propose a robust inference procedure for the (conditional) direct average treatment effect, allowing for cross-unit interference in both the outcome and treatment equations. Leveraging ideas from statistical physics, we introduce a novel Ising model capturing interference in the treatment assignment, and then obtain three main results. First, we establish a Berry-Esseen distributional approximation pointwise in the degree of interference generated by the Ising model. Our distributional approximation recovers known results in the literature under no-interference in treatment assignment, and also highlights a fundamental fragility of inference procedures developed using such a pointwise approximation. Second, we establish a uniform distributional approximation for the Hajek estimator, and develop robust inference procedures that remain valid regardless of the unknown degree of interference in the Ising model. Third, we propose a novel resampling method for implementation of robust inference procedure. A key technical innovation underlying our work is a new \textit{De-Finetti Machine} that facilitates conditional i.i.d. Gaussianization, a technique that may be of independent interest in other settings.</description>

      <title>Functional Network Autoregressive Models for Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel functional vector autoregressive framework for analyzing network interactions of functional outcomes in panel data settings. In this framework, an individual's outcome function is influenced by the outcomes of others through a simultaneous equation system. To estimate the functional parameters of interest, we need to address the endogeneity issue arising from these simultaneous interactions among outcome functions. This issue is carefully handled by developing a novel functional moment-based estimator. We establish the consistency, convergence rate, and pointwise asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. Additionally, we discuss the estimation of marginal effects and impulse response analysis. As an empirical illustration, we analyze the demand for a bike-sharing service in the U.S. The results reveal statistically significant spatial interactions in bike availability across stations, with interaction patterns varying over the time of day.</description>

      <title>Balancing Flexibility and Interpretability: A Conditional Linear Model Estimation via Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional parametric econometric models often rely on rigid functional forms, while nonparametric techniques, despite their flexibility, frequently lack interpretability. This paper proposes a parsimonious alternative by modeling the outcome $Y$ as a linear function of a vector of variables of interest $\boldsymbol{X}$, conditional on additional covariates $\boldsymbol{Z}$. Specifically, the conditional expectation is expressed as $\mathbb{E}[Y|\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{Z}]=\boldsymbol{X}^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}(\boldsymbol{Z})$, where $\boldsymbol{\beta}(\cdot)$ is an unknown Lipschitz-continuous function. We introduce an adaptation of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to estimate this model, balancing the flexibility of machine learning methods with the interpretability of traditional linear models. This approach addresses a key challenge in applied econometrics by accommodating heterogeneity in the relationship between covariates and outcomes. Furthermore, the heterogeneous partial effects of $\boldsymbol{X}$ on $Y$ are represented by $\boldsymbol{\beta}(\cdot)$ and can be directly estimated using our proposed method. Our framework effectively unifies established parametric and nonparametric models, including varying-coefficient, switching regression, and additive models. We provide theoretical guarantees, such as pointwise and $L^p$-norm rates of convergence for the estimator, and establish a pointwise central limit theorem through subsampling, aiding inference on the function $\boldsymbol\beta(\cdot)$. We present Monte Carlo simulation results to assess the finite-sample performance of the method.</description>

      <title>Tensor dynamic conditional correlation model: A new way to pursuit "Holy Grail of investing"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Style investing creates asset classes (or the so-called "styles") with low correlations, aligning well with the principle of "Holy Grail of investing" in terms of portfolio selection. The returns of styles naturally form a tensor-valued time series, which requires new tools for studying the dynamics of the conditional correlation matrix to facilitate the aforementioned principle. Towards this goal, we introduce a new tensor dynamic conditional correlation (TDCC) model, which is based on two novel treatments: trace-normalization and dimension-normalization. These two normalizations adapt to the tensor nature of the data, and they are necessary except when the tensor data reduce to vector data. Moreover, we provide an easy-to-implement estimation procedure for the TDCC model, and examine its finite sample performance by simulations. Finally, we assess the usefulness of the TDCC model in international portfolio selection across ten global markets and in large portfolio selection for 1800 stocks from the Chinese stock market.</description>

      <title>The Risk-Neutral Equivalent Pricing of Model-Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches to asset-pricing under model-uncertainty adapt classical utility-maximisation frameworks and seek theoretical comprehensiveness. We move toward practice by considering binary model-uncertainties and by switching attention from 'preference' to 'constraints'. Economic asset-pricing in this setting is found to decompose naturally into the viable pricing of model-risk and of non-model risk separately such that the former has a unique and intuitive risk-neutral equivalent formulation with convenient properties. Its parameter, a dynamically conserved constant of model-risk inference, allows an integrated representation of ex-ante risk-pricing and bias, such that their ex-post price-effects can be disentangled, through well-known price anomalies.</description>

      <title>Cointegration with Occasionally Binding Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature on nonlinear cointegration, a long-standing open problem relates to how a (nonlinear) vector autoregression, which provides a unified description of the short- and long-run dynamics of a vector of time series, can generate 'nonlinear cointegration' in the profound sense of those series sharing common nonlinear stochastic trends. We consider this problem in the setting of the censored and kinked structural VAR (CKSVAR), which provides a flexible yet tractable framework within which to model time series that are subject to threshold-type nonlinearities, such as those arising due to occasionally binding constraints, of which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on short-term nominal interest rates provides a leading example. We provide a complete characterisation of how common linear and nonlinear stochastic trends may be generated in this model, via unit roots and appropriate generalisations of the usual rank conditions, providing the first extension to date of the Granger-Johansen representation theorem to a nonlinearly cointegrated setting, and thereby giving the first successful treatment of the open problem. The limiting common trend processes include regulated, censored and kinked Brownian motions, none of which have previously appeared in the literature on cointegrated VARs. Our results and running examples illustrate that the CKSVAR is capable of supporting a far richer variety of long-run behaviour than is a linear VAR, in ways that may be particularly useful for the identification of structural parameters.</description>

      <title>Stationarity with Occasionally Binding Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of multivariate threshold autoregressive models, known as censored and kinked structural vector autoregressions (CKSVAR), which are notably able to accommodate series that are subject to occasionally binding constraints. We develop a set of sufficient conditions for the processes generated by a CKSVAR to be stationary, ergodic, and weakly dependent. Our conditions relate directly to the stability of the deterministic part of the model, and are therefore less conservative than those typically available for general vector threshold autoregressive (VTAR) models. Though our criteria refer to quantities, such as refinements of the joint spectral radius, that cannot feasibly be computed exactly, they can be approximated numerically to a high degree of precision.</description>

      <title>When does IV identification not restrict outcomes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02835v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many identification results in instrumental variables (IV) models hold without requiring any restrictions on the distribution of potential outcomes, or how those outcomes are correlated with selection behavior. This enables IV models to allow for arbitrary heterogeneity in treatment effects and the possibility of selection on gains in the outcome. I provide a necessary and sufficient condition for treatment effects to be point identified in a manner that does not restrict outcomes, when the instruments take a finite number of values. The condition generalizes the well-known LATE monotonicity assumption, and unifies a wide variety of other known IV identification results. The result also yields a brute-force approach to reveal all selection models that allow for point identification of treatment effects without restricting outcomes, and then enumerate all of the identified parameters within each such selection model. The search uncovers new selection models that yield identification, provides impossibility results for others, and offers opportunities to relax assumptions on selection used in existing literature. An application considers the identification of complementarities between two cross-randomized treatments, obtaining a necessary and sufficient condition on selection for local average complementarities among compliers to be identified in a manner that does not restrict outcomes. I use this result to revisit two empirical settings, one in which the data are incompatible with this restriction on selection, and another in which the data are compatible with the restriction.</description>

Abstract: We warmly thank Kosuke Imai, Michael Lingzhi Li, and Stefan Wager for their gracious and insightful comments. We are particularly encouraged that both pieces recognize the importance of the research agenda the lecture laid out, which we see as critical for applied researchers. It is also great to see that both underscore the potential of the basic approach we propose - targeting summary features of the CATE after proxy estimation with sample splitting. We are also happy that both papers push us (and the reader) to continue thinking about the inference problem associated with sample splitting. We recognize that our current paper is only scratching the surface of this interesting agenda. Our proposal is certainly not the only option, and it is exciting that both papers provide and assess alternatives. Hopefully, this will generate even more work in this area.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Fisher Market Equilibrium and First-Price Pacing Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02303v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear Fisher market (LFM) is a basic equilibrium model from economics, which also has applications in fair and efficient resource allocation. First-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) is a model capturing budget-management mechanisms in first-price auctions. In certain practical settings such as advertising auctions, there is an interest in performing statistical inference over these models. A popular methodology for general statistical inference is the bootstrap procedure. Yet, for LFM and FPPE there is no existing theory for the valid application of bootstrap procedures. In this paper, we introduce and devise several statistically valid bootstrap inference procedures for LFM and FPPE. The most challenging part is to bootstrap general FPPE, which reduces to bootstrapping constrained M-estimators, a largely unexplored problem. We devise a bootstrap procedure for FPPE under mild degeneracy conditions by using the powerful tool of epi-convergence theory. Experiments with synthetic and semi-real data verify our theory.</description>

      <title>Selective Reviews of Bandit Problems in AI via a Statistical View</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a widely researched area in artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching agents decision-making through interactions with their environment. A key subset includes stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) and continuum-armed bandit (SCAB) problems, which model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This review outlines the foundational models and assumptions of bandit problems, explores non-asymptotic theoretical tools like concentration inequalities and minimax regret bounds, and compares frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for managing exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Additionally, we explore K-armed contextual bandits and SCAB, focusing on their methodologies and regret analyses. We also examine the connections between SCAB problems and functional data analysis. Finally, we highlight recent advances and ongoing challenges in the field.</description>
