      <title>Flow-Through Tensors: A Unified Computational Graph Architecture for Multi-Layer Transportation Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation integrated mobility systems.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for optimal breakaways in cycling: balancing energy expenditure and crash risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical model for optimizing breakaway strategies in competitive cycling, balancing power expenditure, aerodynamic drag, and crashing. Our framework incorporates probabilistic crash dynamics, allowing a cyclist's risk tolerance to shape optimal tactics. We define an objective function that accounts for both finish time differences and the probability of crashing, which we optimize subject to an energy expenditure constraint. We demonstrate the methodology for a flat stage with a simple constant-power breakaway. We then extend this analysis to account for fatigue-driven power decay, and varying terrain and race conditions. We highlight the importance of strategy by demonstrating that carefully planned decision making can lead to a race win even when the energy expenditure is low. Our results highlight and quantify the fact that, at the elite level, success often depends as much on minimizing risk as on maximizing physical output.</description>

      <title>A column generation approach to exact experimental design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the exact D-optimal experimental design problem by proposing an efficient algorithm that rapidly identifies the support of its continuous relaxation. Our method leverages a column generation framework to solve such a continuous relaxation, where each restricted master problem is tackled using a Primal-Dual Interior-Point-based Semidefinite Programming solver. This enables fast and reliable detection of the design's support. The identified support is subsequently used to construct a feasible exact design that is provably close to optimal. We show that, for large-scale instances in which the number of regression points exceeds by far the number of experiments, our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing branch-and-bound-based algorithms in both computational efficiency and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Generating realistic patient data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing algorithms for real-life problems that perform well in practice highly depends on the availability of realistic data for testing. Obtaining real-life data for optimization problems in health care, however, is often difficult. This is especially true for any patient related optimization problems, e.g., for patient-to-room assignment, due to data privacy policies. Furthermore, obtained real-life data usually cannot be published which prohibits reproducibility of results by other researchers. Therefore, often artificially generated instances are used. In this paper, we present combinatorial insights about the feasibility of instances for the patient-to-room assignment problem (PRA). We use these insights to develop a configurable instance generator for PRA with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. Configurability is in this case especially important as we observed in an extensive analysis of real-life data that, e.g., the probability distribution for patients' age and length of stay depends on the respective ward.</description>

      <title>Exact penalty functions in optimization with unbounded constraint sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper identifies necessary and sufficient conditions for the exactness of penalty functions in optimization problems whose constraint sets are not necessarily bounded. The case where the data of problems is locally Lipschitz or semi-algebraic is studied in detail. The conditions are given in terms of properties of the objective and residual functions of the problems in question. The obtained results generalize and improve some known results in the literature on exact penalty functions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimal Stopping with Maximum Value Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an optimal stopping problem with n correlated offers where the goal is to design a (randomized) stopping strategy that maximizes the expected value of the offer in the sequence at which we stop. Instead of assuming to know the complete correlation structure, which is unrealistic in practice, we only assume to have knowledge of the distribution of the maximum value of the sequence, and want to analyze the worst-case correlation structure whose maximum follows this distribution. This can be seen as a trade-off between the setting in which no distributional information is known, and the Bayesian setting in which the (possibly correlated) distributions of all the individual offers are known. As our first main result we show that a deterministic threshold strategy using the monopoly price of the distribution of the maximum value is asymptotically optimal assuming that the expectation of the maximum value grows sublinearly in n. In our second main result, we further tighten this bound by deriving a tight quadratic convergence guarantee for sufficiently smooth distributions of the maximum value. Our results also give rise to a more fine-grained picture regarding prophet inequalities with correlated values, for which distribution-free bounds often only yield a performance guarantee that is of the order 1/n.</description>

      <title>Modified Block Newton Algorithm for $\ell_0$- Regularized Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a globally convergent Newton type method to solve $\ell_0$ regularized sparse optimization problem. In fact, a line search strategy is applied to the Newton method to obtain global convergence. The Jacobian matrix of the original problem is a block upper triangular matrix. To reduce the computational burden, our method only requires the calculation of the block diagonal. We also introduced regularization to overcome matrix singularity. Although we only use the block-diagonal part of the Jacobian matrix, our algorithm still maintains global convergence and achieves a local quadratic convergence rate. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Pricing, bundling, and driver behavior in crowdsourced delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Challenges in last-mile delivery have encouraged innovative solutions like crowdsourced delivery, where online platforms leverage the services of drivers who occasionally perform delivery tasks for compensation. A key challenge is that occasional drivers' acceptance behavior towards offered tasks is uncertain and influenced by task properties and compensation. The current literature lacks formulations that fully address this challenge. Hence, we formulate an integrated problem that maximizes total expected cost savings by offering task bundles to occasional drivers. To this end, we simultaneously determine the optimal bundle set, their assignment to occasional drivers, and compensations for each pair while considering acceptance probabilities, which are captured via generic logistic functions. The vast number of potential bundles, combined with incorporating acceptance probabilities leads to a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) with exponentially many variables. Using mild assumptions, we address these complexities by exploiting properties of the problem, leading to an exact linearization of the MINLP which we solve via a tailored exact column generation algorithm. Our algorithm uses a variant of the elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints (ESPPRC) that features a non-linear and non-additive objective function as its subproblem, for which we develop tailored dominance and pruning strategies. We introduce several heuristic and exact variants and perform an extensive set of experiments evaluating the algorithm performances and solution structures. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms for instances with up to 120 tasks and 60 drivers and highlight the advantages of integrated decision-making over sequential approaches. The sensitivity analysis indicates that compensation is the most influential factor in shaping the bundle structure.</description>

      <title>The Monge optimal transport barycenter problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel methodology is developed for the solution of the data-driven Monge optimal transport barycenter problem, where the pushforward condition is formulated in terms of the statistical independence between two sets of random variables: the factors $z$ and a transformed outcome $y$. Relaxing independence to the uncorrelation between all functions of $z$ and $y$ within suitable finite-dimensional spaces leads to an adversarial formulation, for which the adversarial strategy can be found in closed form through the first principal components of a small-dimensional matrix. The resulting pure minimization problem can be solved very efficiently through gradient descent driven flows in phase space. The methodology extends beyond scenarios where only discrete factors affect the outcome, to multivariate sets of both discrete and continuous factors, for which the corresponding barycenter problems have infinitely many marginals. Corollaries include a new framework for the solution of the Monge optimal transport problem, a procedure for the data-based simulation and estimation of conditional probability densities, and a nonparametric methodology for Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization with Switching Cost with Only One Single Gradient Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online convex optimization with switching cost is considered under the frugal information setting where at time $t$, before action $x_t$ is taken, only a single function evaluation and a single gradient is available at the previously chosen action $x_{t-1}$ for either the current cost function $f_t$ or the most recent cost function $f_{t-1}$. When the switching cost is linear, online algorithms with optimal order-wise competitive ratios are derived for the frugal setting. When the gradient information is noisy, an online algorithm whose competitive ratio grows quadratically with the noise magnitude is derived.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and stability analysis of a third-order multiclass traffic flow model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic flow modeling spans a wide range of mathematical approaches, from microscopic descriptions of individual vehicle dynamics to macroscopic models based on aggregate quantities. A fundamental challenge in macroscopic modeling lies in the closure relations, particularly in the specification of a traffic hesitation function in second-order models like Aw-Rascle-Zhang. In this work, we propose a third-order hyperbolic traffic model in which the hesitation evolves as a driver-dependent dynamic quantity. Starting from a microscopic formulation, we relax the standard assumption by introducing an evolution law for the hesitation. This extension allows to incorporate hysteresis effects, modeling the fact that drivers respond differently when accelerating or decelerating, even under identical local traffic conditions. Furthermore, various relaxation terms are introduced. These allow us to establish relations to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model and other traffic flow models.</description>

      <title>Gramians for a New Class of Nonlinear Control Systems Using Koopman and a Novel Generalized SVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model reduction with error bounds in nonlinear systems with non-affine control inputs remains an active field of research. In this work we present a construction for Controllability and Observability Gramians in a class of non-affine control input systems satisfying certain induced norm properties. We do so using a combination of representational forms, including a novel function decomposition that resembles linear Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), in tandem with an additional unconventional decomposition of the dynamics, and Koopman operator theory. The resulting representation allows one to place error bounds on the $H_{\infty}$ norm on a reduced-order representation of the system computed using finite-dimensional nonlinear Controllability and Observability Gramians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a methodology for closing duality gap and guaranteeing strong duality in infinite convex optimization. Specifically, we examine two new Lagrangian-type dual formulations involving infinitely many dual variables and infinite sums of functions. Unlike the classical Haar duality scheme, these dual problems provide zero duality gap and are solvable under the standard Slater condition. Then we derive general optimality conditions/multiplier rules by applying subdifferential rules for infinite sums established in [13].</description>

      <title>Regression-Based Single-Point Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) is widely used for solving black-box optimization and control problems. In particular, single-point ZO (SZO) is well-suited to online or dynamic problem settings due to its requirement of only a single function evaluation per iteration. However, SZO suffers from high gradient estimation variance and slow convergence, which severely limit its practical applicability. Despite recent advances, the convergence of existing SZO methods remains inferior to that of two-point ZO methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel yet simple SZO framework, termed regression-based SZO (RESZO), which substantially enhances the convergence rate. Unlike conventional ZO methods that rely solely on function evaluations at the current point for gradient estimation, RESZO improves gradient estimation by effectively leveraging historical function evaluations from previous iterations. Specifically, RESZO constructs a surrogate function via regression using recent historical evaluations and employs the gradient of this surrogate function for iterative updates. Two variants of RESZO, which fit linear and quadratic surrogate functions respectively, are introduced. Theoretically, we provide a non-asymptotic convergence analysis for the linear variant of RESZO, showing that its convergence rates are comparable to those of two-point ZO methods for both smooth nonconvex and strongly convex functions. Moreover, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that RESZO not only matches but empirically outperforms two-point ZO in terms of function query complexity.</description>

      <title>Soft Actor-Critic with Backstepping-Pretrained DeepONet for control of PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a reinforcement learning-based controller for the stabilization of partial differential equation (PDE) systems. Within the soft actor-critic (SAC) framework, we embed a DeepONet, a well-known neural operator (NO), which is pretrained using the backstepping controller. The pretrained DeepONet captures the essential features of the backstepping controller and serves as a feature extractor, replacing the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) layers in the original actor and critic networks, and directly connects to the fully connected layers of the SAC architecture. We apply this novel backstepping and reinforcement learning integrated method to stabilize an unstable ffrst-order hyperbolic PDE and an unstable reactiondiffusion PDE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the standard SAC, SAC with an untrained DeepONet, and the backstepping controller on both systems.</description>

      <title>Mission-Aligned Learning-Informed Control of Autonomous Systems: Formulation and Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research, innovation and practical capital investment have been increasing rapidly toward the realization of autonomous physical agents. This includes industrial and service robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, embedded control devices, and a number of other realizations of cybernetic/mechatronic implementations of intelligent autonomous devices. In this paper, we consider a stylized version of robotic care, which would normally involve a two-level Reinforcement Learning procedure that trains a policy for both lower level physical movement decisions as well as higher level conceptual tasks and their sub-components. In order to deliver greater safety and reliability in the system, we present the general formulation of this as a two-level optimization scheme which incorporates control at the lower level, and classical planning at the higher level, integrated with a capacity for learning. This synergistic integration of multiple methodologies -- control, classical planning, and RL -- presents an opportunity for greater insight for algorithm development, leading to more efficient and reliable performance. Here, the notion of reliability pertains to physical safety and interpretability into an otherwise black box operation of autonomous agents, concerning users and regulators. This work presents the necessary background and general formulation of the optimization framework, detailing each component and its integration with the others.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Programming Algorithm with $O(n^3)$ Time Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving linear systems and quadratic programming (QP) problems are both ubiquitous tasks in the engineering and computing fields. Direct methods for solving systems, such as Cholesky, LU, and QR factorizations, exhibit data-independent time complexity of $O(n^3)$. This raises a natural question: could there exist algorithms for solving QPs that also achieve \textit{data-independent} time complexity of $O(n^3)$? This raises a natural question: could there exist algorithms for solving QPs that also achieve data-independent time complexity of $O(n^3)$? This is critical for offering an execution time certificate for real-time optimization-based applications such as model predictive control. This article first demonstrates that solving real-time strictly convex QPs, Lasso problems, and support vector machine problems can be turned into solving box-constrained QPs (Box-QPs), which support a cost-free initialization strategy for feasible interior-point methods (IPMs). Next, focusing on solving Box-QPs, this article replaces the exact Newton step with an approximated Newton step (substituting the matrix-inversion operation with multiple rank-1 updates) within feasible IPMs. For the first time, this article proposes an implementable feasible IPM algorithm with $O(n^3)$ time complexity, by proving the number of iterations is exact $O(\sqrt{n})$ and the number of rank-1 updates is bounded by $O(n)$. Numerical validations/applications and codes are provided.</description>

      <title>Robust Vehicle Rebalancing with Deep Uncertainty in Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) services offer an opportunity for improving passenger service while reducing pollution and energy consumption through effective vehicle coordination. A primary challenge in the autonomous fleets coordination is to tackle the inherent issue of supply-demand imbalance. A key strategy in resolving this is vehicle rebalancing, strategically directing idle vehicles to areas with anticipated future demand. Traditional research focuses on deterministic optimization using specific demand forecasts, but the unpredictable nature of demand calls for methods that can manage this uncertainty. This paper introduces the Deep Uncertainty Robust Optimization (DURO), a framework specifically designed for vehicle rebalancing in AMoD systems amidst uncertain demand based on neural networks for robust optimization. DURO forecasts demand uncertainty intervals using a deep neural network, which are then integrated into a robust optimization model. We assess DURO against various established models, including deterministic optimization with refined demand forecasts and Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). Based on real-world data from New York City (NYC), our findings show that DURO surpasses traditional deterministic models in accuracy and is on par with DRO, but with superior computational efficiency. The DURO framework is a promising approach for vehicle rebalancing in AMoD systems that is proven to be effective in managing demand uncertainty, competitive in performance, and more computationally efficient than other optimization models.</description>

      <title>An experimental approach: Converting verbal expressions to numerical scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key issues in decision problems is the selection and use of the appropriate response scale. In this paper verbal expressions are converted into numerical scales for a subjective problem instance. The main motivation for our research was that verbal values in decision tasks are often mechanically converted into numbers, which thus typically do not fully represent the respondent's true evaluation. In our experiment, we conducted a color selection test with 462 subjects by testing six colors (red, green, blue, magenta, turquoise, yellow) defined from the Color Namer database on color-calibrated tablets in ISO standardized sensory test booths of a sensory laboratory. The colors were evaluated both in a pairwise comparison matrix (indirect ranking with four-item verbal category scale) and on a direct scoring basis. We determined scales that provide the closest results on average and individually to the direct scoring, based on the eigenvector and the logarithmic least squares methods. All results show that the difference between verbal expressions is much smaller than the one used by most of the common numerical scales. The respondents' inconsistency was also analyzed, even with a repeated question regarding their preference between a given pair of colors. It is shown that most decision makers answer fairly similarly for the second time, but there can be significant (even ordinal) differences. The respondents whose answers are further from the original tends to be more inconsistent in general.</description>

      <title>Markov Perfect Equilibria in Discrete Finite-Player and Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamic finite-player and mean-field stochastic games within the framework of Markov perfect equilibria (MPE). Our focus is on discrete time and space structures without monotonicity. Unlike their continuous-time analogues, discrete-time finite-player games generally do not admit unique MPE. However, we show that uniqueness is remarkably recovered when the time steps are sufficiently small, and we provide examples demonstrating the necessity of this assumption. This result, established without relying on any monotonicity conditions, underscores the importance of inertia in dynamic games. In both the finite-player and mean-field settings, we show that MPE correspond to solutions of the Nash-Lasry-Lions equation, which is known as the master equation in the mean-field case. We exploit this connection to establish the convergence of discrete-time finite-player games to their mean-field counterpart in short time. Finally, we prove the convergence of finite-player games to their continuous-time version on every time horizon.</description>

      <title>Robust Incentive Stackelberg Mean Field Stochastic Linear-Quadratic Differential Game with Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a robust incentive Stackelberg stochastic differential game problem for a linear-quadratic mean field system, where the model uncertainty appears in the drift term of the leader's state equation. Moreover, both the state average and control averages enter into the leader's dynamics and cost functional. Based on the zero-sum game approach, mean field approximation and duality theory, firstly the representation of the leader's limiting cost functional and the closed-loop representation of decentralized open-loop saddle points are given, via decoupling methods. Then by convex analysis and the variational method, the decentralized strategies of the followers' auxiliary limiting problems and the corresponding consistency condition system are derived. Finally, applying decoupling technique, the leader's approximate incentive strategy set is obtained, under which the asymptotical robust incentive optimality of the decentralized mean field strategy is verified. A numerical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Strategies for the N-agent Mean-Variance Investment Problem over a Random Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equilibrium feedback strategies for a family of dynamic mean-variance problems with competition among a large group of agents. We assume that the time horizon is random and each agent's risk aversion depends dynamically on the current wealth. We consider both the finite population game and the corresponding mean-field one. Each agent can invest in a risk-free asset and a specific individual stock, which is correlated with other stocks by a common noise. By applying stochastic control theory, we derive the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system of equations for both $n$-agent and mean-field games. Under an exponentially distributed random horizon, we explicitly obtain the equilibrium feedback strategies and the value functions in both cases. Our results show that the agent's equilibrium feedback strategy depends not only on his/her current wealth but also on the wealth of other competitors. Moreover, when the risk aversion is state-independent and the risk-free interest rate is set to zero, the equilibrium strategies degenerate to constants, which is identical to the unique equilibrium obtained in \citet{lacker2019mean} with exponential risk preferences; when the competition parameter goes to zero and the risk aversion equals some specific value, the equilibrium strategies coincide with the ones derived in \citet{landriault2018equilibrium}.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Inexact Gradient Descent for Quadratic Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an inexact optimization algorithm on Riemannian manifolds, motivated by quadratic discrimination tasks in high-dimensional, low-sample-size (HDLSS) imaging settings. In such applications, gradient evaluations are often biased due to limited sample sizes. To address this, we introduce a novel Riemannian optimization algorithm that is robust to inexact gradient information and prove an $\mathcal O(1/K)$ convergence rate under standard assumptions. We also present a line search variant that requires access to function values but not exact gradients, maintaining the same convergence rate and ensuring sufficient descent. The algorithm is tailored to the Grassmann manifold by leveraging its geometric structure, and its convergence rate is validated numerically. A simulation of heteroscedastic images shows that when bias is introduced into the problem, both intentionally and through estimation of the covariance matrix, the detection performance of the algorithm solution is comparable to when true gradients are used in the optimization. The optimal subspace learned via the algorithm encodes interpretable patterns and shows qualitative similarity to known optimal solutions. By ensuring robust convergence and interpretability, our algorithm offers a compelling tool for manifold-based dimensionality reduction and discrimination in high-dimensional image data settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the number of different basic solutions generated by the simplex method with the maximum distance rule. The pivoting rule was recently proposed, and in some cases, it was reported to be more efficient than the renowned steepest edge rule. If the problem is nondegenerate, these results provide bounds on the number of iterations. As far as we know, they are the first theoretical bounds for the maximum distance rule.</description>

      <title>A Lasry-Lions envelope approach for mathematical programs with complementarity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a homotopy method for solving mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (CCs). The indicator function of the CCs is relaxed by a Lasry-Lions double envelope, an extension of the Moreau envelope that enjoys an additional smoothness property that makes it amenable to fast optimization algorithms. The proposed algorithm mimics the behavior of homotopy methods for systems of nonlinear equations or penalty methods for constrained optimization: it solves a sequence of smooth subproblems that progressively approximate the original problem, using the solution of each subproblem as the starting point for the next one. In the limiting setting, we establish the convergence to Mordukhovich and Clarke stationary points. We also provide a worst-case complexity analysis for computing an approximate stationary point. Preliminary numerical results on a suite of benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Optimal Control of Discrete-Time Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) for discrete-time linear systems. This problem can be regarded as an extension of a maximum entropy optimal control problem (MEOCP). Differently from the MEOCP where the prior is fixed to the uniform distribution, the MIOCP optimizes the policy and prior simultaneously. As analytical results, under the policy and prior classes consisting of Gaussian distributions, we derive the optimal policy and prior of the MIOCP with the prior and policy fixed, respectively. Using the results, we propose an alternating minimization algorithm for the MIOCP. Through numerical experiments, we discuss how our proposed algorithm works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel characterization of the reachable set of discrete-time switched linear control systems and a Kalman-type criterion for controllability, assuming that the switching parameter can be used as a control parameter in addition to the actual control variable. For controllable switched linear control systems it turns out that there always exists a switching sequence such that the reachable set of the corresponding linear time-variant system covers the whole state space after a sufficiently large time. We provide estimates on the minimal time guaranteeing this property in terms of the state dimension, number of modes and rank of the control matrices, and show that such estimates are actually tight in some relevant cases.</description>

      <title>Time-inconsistent singular control problems: Reflection and Absolutely continuous controls with exploding rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a time-inconsistent singular stochastic control problem for a general one-dimensional diffusion, where time-inconsistency arises from a non-exponential discount function. To address this, we adopt a game-theoretic framework and study the optimality of a novel class of controls that encompasses both traditional singular controls -- responsible for generating multiple jumps and reflective boundaries (strong thresholds) -- and new mild threshold control strategies, which allow for the explosion of the control rate in absolutely continuous controls, thereby creating an inaccessible boundary (mild threshold) for the controlled process. We establish a general verification theorem, formulated in terms of a system of variational inequalities, that provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for equilibrium within the proposed class of control strategies and their combinations. To demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical results, we examine case studies in inventory management. We show that for certain parameter values, the problem admits a strong threshold control equilibrium in the form of Skorokhod reflection. In contrast, for other parameter values, we prove that no such equilibrium exists, necessitating the use of our extended control class. In the latter case, we explicitly construct an equilibrium using a mild threshold control strategy with a discontinuous, increasing, and exploding rate that induces an inaccessible boundary for the optimally controlled process, marking the first example of a singular control problem with such a solution structure.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Vector-Valued Splines for the Resolution of Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for the reconstruction of vector-valued functions from finite and possibly noisy data, acquired through a known measurement operator. The reconstruction is done by the minimization of a loss functional formed as the sum of a convex data fidelity functional and a total-variation-based regularizer involving a suitable matrix L of differential operators. Here, the total variation is a norm on the space of vector measures. These are split into two categories: inner, and outer norms. The minimization is performed over an infinite-dimensional Banach search space. When the measurement operator is weakstar-continuous over the search space, our main result is that the solution set of the loss functional is the closed convex hull of adaptive L-splines, with fewer knots than the number of measurements. We reveal the effect of the total-variation norms on the structure of the solutions and show that inner norms yield sparser solutions. We also provide an explicit description of the class of admissible measurement operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The market split problem (MSP), introduced by Cornuejols and Dawande (1998), is a challenging binary optimization problem that performs poorly on state-of-the-art linear programming-based branch-and-cut solvers. We present a novel algorithm for solving the feasibility version of this problem, derived from Schroeppel-Shamir's algorithm for the one-dimensional subset sum problem. Our approach is based on exhaustively enumerating one-dimensional solutions of MSP and utilizing GPUs to evaluate candidate solutions across the entire problem. The resulting hybrid CPU-GPU implementation efficiently solves instances with up to 10 constraints and 90 variables. We demonstrate the algorithm's performance on benchmark problems, solving instances of size (9, 80) in less than fifteen minutes and (10, 90) in up to one day.</description>

      <title>Optimal Consumption-Investment for General Utility with a Drawdown Constraint over a Finite-Time Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an optimal investment and consumption problem over a finite-time horizon, in which an individual invests in a risk-free asset and a risky asset, and evaluate utility using a general utility function that exhibits loss aversion with respect to the historical maximum of consumption. Motivated by behavioral finance and habit formation theory, we model the agent's preference for maintaining a standard of living by imposing constraints on declines from the peak consumption level. To solve the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) variational inequality, which is fully nonlinear, we apply a dual transformation, transforming the original problem into a linear singular control problem with a constraint. By differentiating the value function further, we reduce the constrained linear singular control problem to a linear obstacle problem. We prove the existence of a solution to the obstacle problem under standard constraints. It allows us to characterize the optimal consumption and investment strategies through piecewise analytical feedback forms derived from the dual formulation. Our analysis contributes to the literature on habit formation, drawdown constraints, and stochastic control by explicitly characterizing the time-dependent free boundaries and the associated optimal feedback strategies.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Scheduling Method for Nurse Scheduling and Its Practical Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation of nurses' schedules is a critical task that directly impacts the quality and safety of patient care as well as the quality of life for nurses. In most hospitals in Japan, this responsibility falls to the head nurse of each ward. The physical and mental burden of this task is considerable, and recent challenges such as the growing shortage of nurses and increasingly diverse working styles have further complicated the scheduling process. Consequently, there is a growing demand for automated nurse scheduling systems. Technically, modern integer programming solvers can generate feasible schedules within a practical timeframe. However, in many hospitals, schedules are still created manually. This is largely because tacit knowledge, considerations unconsciously applied by head nurses, cannot be fully formalized into explicit constraints, often resulting in automatically generated schedules that are not practically usable. To address this issue, we propose a novel "two-stage scheduling method." This approach divides the scheduling task into night shift and day shift stages, allowing head nurses to make manual adjustments after the first stage. This interactive process makes it possible to produce nurse schedules that are suitable for real-world implementation. Furthermore, to promote the practical adoption of nurse scheduling, we present case studies from acute and chronic care hospitals where systems based on the proposed method were deployed. We also discuss the challenges encountered during implementation and the corresponding solutions.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Robustness Bounds for Second-Order Pruning of Neural Controller Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear. We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz. Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$, producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$ and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state $s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases, and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the robustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>MathOptAI.jl: Embed trained machine learning predictors into JuMP models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \texttt{MathOptAI.jl}, an open-source Julia library for embedding trained machine learning predictors into a JuMP model. \texttt{MathOptAI.jl} can embed a wide variety of neural networks, decision trees, and Gaussian Processes into a larger mathematical optimization model. In addition to interfacing a range of Julia-based machine learning libraries such as \texttt{Lux.jl} and \texttt{Flux.jl}, \texttt{MathOptAI.jl} uses Julia's Python interface to provide support for PyTorch models. When the PyTorch support is combined with \texttt{MathOptAI.jl}'s gray-box formulation, the function, Jacobian, and Hessian evaluations associated with the PyTorch model are offloaded to the GPU in Python, while the rest of the nonlinear oracles are evaluated on the CPU in Julia. \MathOptAI is available at https://github.com/lanl-ansi/MathOptAI.jl under a BSD-3 license.</description>

      <title>Robust and Efficient Embedded Convex Optimization through First-Order Adaptive Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Model Predictive Control (MPC) leveraging a combination of first-order methods, such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and offline precomputation and caching of select operations, have excitingly enabled real-time MPC on microcontrollers. Unfortunately, these approaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their adaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order Adaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also their sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online hyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks, achieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized fixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache recomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2) complexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on a 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation open-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community.</description>

      <title>On the non-convexity issue in the radial Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical approach to the Calder\'on problem is to estimate the unknown conductivity by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. It is generally believed that it leads to a nonconvex optimization problem which is riddled with bad local minimums. This has motivated the development of reconstruction methods based on convex optimization, one recent contribution being the nonlinear convex semidefinite programming approach of Harrach (2023). In this work, we investigate the computational viability of this convex approach in a simple setting where the conductivities are piecewise constant and radial. We implement this convex reconstruction method and compare it extensively to the least squares approach. Our experiments suggest that this convex programming approach only allows to accurately estimate the unknown for problems with a very small size. Moreover, surprisingly, it is consistently outperformed by Newton-type least squares solvers, which are also faster and require less measurements. We revisit the issue of nonconvexity in this piecewise constant radial setting and prove that, contrary to previous claims, there are no local minimums in the case of two scalar unknowns with no measurement noise. We also provide a partial proof of this result in the general setting which holds under a numerically verifiable assumption.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of the $z$-Transform Method in Quadratic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its $z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the $z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem refers to the question of the existence of a Nash equilibrium in an abstract economy. This model is due to Kenneth J. Arrow and Gerard Debreu in their pioneering work from 1954. An abstract economy is an extension of John Nash's original concept of a non-cooperative game from the 1950's. Here players selfishly seek to maximize their profits, which may depend on the others' choices. The novelty of an abstract economy is that the players may now mutually constrain each-other in their decision-making. A Nash equilibrium is reached when no player alone can increase his profit by a unilateral change of strategy. Abstract economies have found widespread applications from welfare economy, economic analysis and policy-making to constrained optimization, partial differential equations and optimal allocation.
  We generalize Leigh Tesfatsion's Nash equilibrium existence result to abstract economies without resorting to commonly employed convexity assumptions, thereby also re-proving all known Nash equilibrium existence results as special cases. A key element of our proof is the translation of the Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem into the question of the existence of a coincidence of two particularly defined maps, and the application of a coincidence result from algebraic topology due to Samuel Eilenberg and Deane Montgomery in 1946.</description>

      <title>Spectrahedral relaxations of Eulerian rigidly convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Eulerian polynomials to the multivariate setting introduced by Br\"and\'en. Although initially these polynomials were introduced using the language of hyperbolic and stable polynomials, we manage to translate some restrictions of these polynomials to our real zero setting. Once we are in this setting, we focus our attention on the rigidly convex sets (RCSs) defined by these polynomials. In particular, we study the corresponding rigidly convex sets looking at spectrahedral relaxations constructed through the use of monic symmetric linear matrix polynomials (MSLMPs) of small size and depending polynomially (actually just cubically) on the coefficients of the corresponding polynomials. We analyze how good are the obtained spectrahedral approximations to these rigidly convex sets. We do this analysis by measuring the behavior along the diagonal, where we precisely recover the original univariate Eulerian polynomials. Thus we conclude that, measuring through the diagonal, our relaxation-based spectrahedral method for approximation of the rigidly convex sets defined by multivariate Eulerian polynomials is highly accurate. In particular, we see that this relaxation-based spectrahedral method for approximation of the rigidly convex sets defined by multivariate Eulerian polynomials provides bounds for the extreme roots of the corresponding univariate Eulerian polynomials that are better than these already found in the literature. All in all, this tells us that, at least close to the diagonal, the global outer approximation to the rigidly convex sets provided by this relaxation-based spectrahedral method is itself highly accurate.</description>

      <title>Network Behavioral-Feedback SIR Epidemic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a network behavioral-feedback Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model in which the interaction matrix describing the infection rates across subpopulations depends in feedback on the current epidemic state. This model captures both heterogeneities in individuals mixing, contact frequency, aptitude to contract and spread the infection, and endogenous behavioral responses such as voluntary social distancing and the adoption of self-protective measures. We study the stability of the equilibria and illustrate through several examples how the shape of the stability region depends on the structure of the interaction matrix, providing insights for the design of effective control strategies. We then analyze the transient behavior of the dynamics, showing that, for a special class of rank-1 interaction matrices, there always exists an aggregate infection curve that exhibits a unimodal behavior, expanding the results on the unimodality of infection curve known in the literature of epidemic models and paving the way for future control applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Node Localization for Rough and Extreme Deployment Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications have been identified which require the deployment of large-scale low-power wireless sensor networks. Some of the deployment environments, however, impose harsh operation conditions due to intense cross-technology interference, extreme weather conditions (heavy rainfall, excessive heat, etc.), or rough motion, thereby affecting the quality and predictability of the wireless links the nodes establish. In localization tasks, these conditions often lead to significant errors in estimating the position of target nodes. Motivated by the practical deployments of sensors on the surface of different water bodies, we address the problem of identifying susceptible nodes and robustly estimating their positions. We formulate these tasks as a compressive sensing problem and propose algorithms for both node identification and robust estimation. Additionally, we design an optimal anchor configuration to maximize the robustness of the position estimation task. Our numerical results and comparisons with competitive methods demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve both objectives with a modest number of anchors. Since our method relies only on target-to-anchor distances, it is broadly applicable and yields resilient, robust localization.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Stochastic Approximation Algorithms for Fairness-Constrained Training of Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with constraints is instrumental in improving the fairness of modern machine-learning models. Many algorithms have been analysed in recent years, and yet there is no standard, widely accepted method for the constrained training of DNNs. In this paper, we provide a challenging benchmark of real-world large-scale fairness-constrained learning tasks, built on top of the US Census (Folktables). We point out the theoretical challenges of such tasks and review the main approaches in stochastic approximation algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the benchmark by implementing and comparing three recently proposed, but as-of-yet unimplemented, algorithms both in terms of optimization performance, and fairness improvement. We release the code of the benchmark as a Python package at https://github.com/humancompatible/train.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the scores of random dynamical systems, then formally pass to the continuous-time limit of SDEs. Our formula works for multiplicative noise systems over any period of time; it does not require hyperbolicity. We also consider several special cases: (1) for additive noise, we give a pure kernel formula; (2) for short-time, we give a pure divergence formula; (3) we give a formula which does not involve scores of the initial distribution. Based on the new formula, we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm for scores, and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system with multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Attractors for Second Order in Time Non-Conservative Dynamics with Nonlinear Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-time behavior of solutions to a nonlinear plate model subject to non-conservative and non-dissipative effects and nonlinear damping is considered. The model under study is a prototype for a suspension bridge under the effects of unstable flow of gas. To counteract the unwanted oscillations a damping mechanism of a nonlinear nature is applied. From the point of view of nonlinear PDEs, we are dealing with a non-dissipative and nonlinear second order in time dynamical system of hyperbolic nature subjected to nonlinear damping. One of the first goals is to establish ultimate dissipativity of all solutions, which will imply an existence of a weak attractor. The combined effects of non-dissipative forcing with nonlinear damping-leading to an overdamping-give rise to major challenges in proving an existence of an absorbing set. Known methods based on equipartition of the energy do not suffice. A rather general novel methodology based on ``barrier's'' method will be developed to address this and related problems. Ultimately, it will be shown that a weak attractor becomes strong, and the nonlinear PDE system has a coherent finite-dimensional asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Two-sided Assortment Optimization: Revenue Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study adaptive two-sided assortment optimization for revenue maximization in choice-based matching platforms. The platform has two sides of agents, an initiating side, and a responding side. The decision-maker sequentially selects agents from the initiating side, shows each an assortment of agents from the responding side, and observes their choices. After processing all initiating agents, the responding agents are shown assortments and make their selections. A match occurs when two agents mutually select each other, generating pair-dependent revenue. Choices follow Multinomial Logit (MNL) models. This setting generalizes prior work focused on maximizing the number of matches under submodular demand assumptions, which do not hold in our revenue-maximization context. Our main contribution is the design of polynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant-factor guarantees. In particular, for general pairwise revenues, we develop a randomized algorithm that achieves a $(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon)$-approximation in expectation for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. The algorithm is static and provides guarantees under various agent arrival settings, including fixed order, simultaneous processing, and adaptive selection. When revenues are uniform across all pairs involving any given responding-side agent, the guarantee improves to $(1 - \frac{1}{e} - \epsilon)$. In structural settings where responding-side agents share a common revenue-based ranking, we design a simpler adaptive deterministic algorithm achieving a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation. Our approach leverages novel linear programming relaxations, correlation gap arguments, and structural properties of the revenue functions.</description>

      <title>Inertial Quadratic Majorization Minimization with Application to Kernel Regularized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order methods in convex optimization offer low per-iteration cost but often suffer from slow convergence, while second-order methods achieve fast local convergence at the expense of costly Hessian inversions. In this paper, we highlight a middle ground: minimizing a quadratic majorant with fixed curvature at each iteration. This strategy strikes a balance between per-iteration cost and convergence speed, and crucially allows the reuse of matrix decompositions, such as Cholesky or spectral decompositions, across iterations and varying regularization parameters. We introduce the Quadratic Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation (QMME) framework and establish its sequential convergence properties under standard assumptions. The new perspective of our analysis is to center the arguments around the induced norm of the curvature matrix $H$. To demonstrate practical advantages, we apply QMME to large-scale kernel regularized learning problems. In particular, we propose a novel Sylvester equation modelling technique for kernel multinomial regression. In Julia-based experiments, QMME compares favorably against various established first- and second-order methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithms complement existing kernel approximation techniques through more efficiently handling sketching matrices with large projection dimensions. Our numerical experiments and real data analysis are available and fully reproducible at https://github.com/qhengncsu/QMME.jl.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sizing and Control of a Grid-Connected Battery in a Stacked Revenue Model Including an Energy Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid increases in intermittent renewable generation, requiring novel battery energy storage systems (BESS) solutions. One recent trend is the emergence of large grid-connected batteries, that can be controlled to provide multiple storage and flexibility services, using a stacked revenue model. Another emerging development is renewable energy communities (REC), in which prosumers invest in their own renewable generation capacity, but also requiring battery storage for flexibility. In this paper, we study settings in which energy communities rent battery capacity from a battery operator through a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) model. We present a methodology for determining the sizing and pricing of battery capacity that can be rented, such that it provides economic benefits to both the community and the battery operator that participates in the energy market. We examine how sizes and prices vary across a number of different scenarios for different types of tariffs (flat, dynamic) and competing energy market uses. Second, we conduct a systematic study of linear optimization models for battery control when deployed to provide flexibility to energy communities. We show that existing approaches for battery control with daily time windows have a number of important limitations in practical deployments, and we propose a number of regularization functions in the optimization to address them. Finally, we investigate the proposed method using real generation, demand, tariffs, and battery data, based on a practical case study from a large battery operator in the Netherlands. For the settings in our case study, we find that a community of 200 houses with a 330 kW wind turbine can save up to 12,874 euros per year by renting just 280 kWh of battery capacity (after subtracting battery rental costs), with the methodology applicable to a wide variety of settings and tariff types.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Sample Complexity of First-Order Methods for Agnostic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting, where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD) condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm \citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and \emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key assumption.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Bandits with Knapsacks with Improved Regret and Time Complexities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandits with knapsacks (BwK) constitute a fundamental model that combines aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. Classical algorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret bound of ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\log T)$. In this paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum computing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via quantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent regret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we demonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a factor of $(1+\sqrt{B/\mathrm{OPT}_\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget constraint in BwK and $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of a linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem. For the problem-dependent setting, we develop a quantum algorithm using an inexact quantum linear programming solver. This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of the problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time complexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts. Compared to previous works on quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our study is the first to consider bandit models with resource constraints and hence shed light on operations research.</description>

      <title>The Fair Periodic Assignment Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the periodic assignment problem, in which a set of periodically repeating tasks must be assigned to workers within a repeating schedule. The classical efficiency objective is to minimize the number of workers required to operate the schedule. We propose a O(n log n) algorithm to solve this problem. Next, we formalize a notion of fairness among workers, and impose that each worker performs the same work over time. We analyze the resulting trade-off between efficiency and fairness, showing that the price of fairness is at most one extra worker, and that such a fair solution can always be found using the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. We characterize all instances that admit a solution that is both fair and efficient, and use this result to develop a O(n log n) exact algorithm for the fair periodic assignment problem. Finally, we show that allowing aperiodic schedules never reduces the price of fairness.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Transfers linking Ballistic Captures to Earth-Moon Periodic Orbit Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of transfers to periodic orbits in the Earth--Moon system has regained prominence with NASA's Artemis and CNSA's Chang'e programs. This work addresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting multi-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic motion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A unified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to families of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP dynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous 'abacus' parameterization of orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers to planar periodic-orbit families (Lyapunov L1 and L2, and distant retrograde orbits) are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families, such as butterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits, with an emphasis towards Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-cost solutions and validate the method's adaptability for the design of lunar missions. The optimized trajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching it with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and underlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic-orbit families. Finally, the proposed transfers provide reliable initial guesses for rapid refinement, readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific needs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.09416v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates quadratic hedging in a semimartingale market that does not necessarily contain a risk-free asset. An equivalence result for hedging with and without numeraire change is established. This permits direct computation of the optimal strategy without choosing a reference asset and/or performing a numeraire change. New explicit expressions for optimal strategies are obtained, featuring the use of oblique projections that provide unified treatment of the case with and without a risk-free asset. The analysis yields a streamlined computation of the efficient frontier for the pure investment problem in terms of three easily interpreted processes. The main result advances our understanding of the efficient frontier formation in the most general case where a risk-free asset may not be present. Several illustrations of the numeraire-invariant approach are given.</description>

      <title>On Global and Local Convergence of Iterative Linear Quadratic Optimization Algorithms for Discrete Time Nonlinear Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical approach for solving discrete time nonlinear control on a finite horizon consists in repeatedly minimizing linear quadratic approximations of the original problem around current candidate solutions. While widely popular in many domains, such an approach has mainly been analyzed locally. We provide detailed convergence guarantees to stationary points as well as local linear convergence rates for the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (ILQR) algorithm and its Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) variant. For problems without costs on control variables, we observe that global convergence to minima can be ensured provided that the linearized discrete time dynamics are surjective, costs on the state variables are gradient dominated. We further detail quadratic local convergence when the costs are self-concordant. We show that surjectivity of the linearized dynamics hold for appropriate discretization schemes given the existence of a feedback linearization scheme. We present complexity bounds of algorithms based on linear quadratic approximations through the lens of generalized Gauss-Newton methods. Our analysis uncovers several convergence phases for regularized generalized Gauss-Newton algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative optimization algorithms depend on access to information about the objective function. In a differentiable programming framework, this information, such as gradients, can be automatically derived from the computational graph. We explore how nonlinear control algorithms, often employing linear and/or quadratic approximations, can be effectively cast within this framework. Our approach illuminates shared components and differences between gradient descent, Gauss-Newton, Newton, and differential dynamic programming methods in the context of discrete time nonlinear control. Furthermore, we present line-search strategies and regularized variants of these algorithms, along with a comprehensive analysis of their computational complexities. We study the performance of the aforementioned algorithms on various nonlinear control benchmarks, including autonomous car racing simulations using a simplified car model. All implementations are publicly available in a package coded in a differentiable programming language.</description>

      <title>Individual Path Recommendation Under Public Transit Service Disruptions Considering Behavior Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public transit passengers need guidance during service disruptions. This study proposes an individual-based path (IPR) recommendation model. The model decides which paths to recommend for each passenger with the objective of minimizing system travel time and respecting passengers' path choice preferences. We assume the recommendations could affect passengers' path choice probabilities, but their actual choices are uncertain. This behavior uncertainty makes the problem a stochastic optimization with decision-dependent distributions. We propose a single-point approximation method to eliminate the expectation operator by introducing two new concepts: epsilon-feasibility and Gamma-concentration, which control the mean and variance of path flows in the optimization problem. The approximation yields a tractable single-stage mixed integer linear formulation, which can be solved efficiently with Benders decomposition. The approximation gap is approved to be bounded from the above. Additional theoretical analysis shows that epsilon-feasibility and Gamma-concentration are strongly connected to expectation and chance constraints in a typical stochastic optimization formulation, respectively. The model is implemented in a real-world case study using data from an urban rail disruption in the Chicago Transit Authority system, and a synthetic case study with varied network sizes and incident locations. In the real-world case study, results show that the proposed IPR model reduces the average travel times in the system by 6.6% compared to the status quo and by 4.2% compared to a capacity-based benchmark model. In the synthetic case study, the proposed model shows 15.0% to 1.8% lower system travel time compared to the capacity-based benchmark, depending on the network sizes and demand situations.</description>

      <title>An Inexact Feasible Interior Point Method for Linear Optimization with High Adaptability to Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of quantum computing to accelerate complex optimization problems is a burgeoning research field. This paper applies Quantum Linear System Algorithms (QLSAs) to Newton systems within Interior Point Methods (IPMs) to take advantage of quantum speedup in solving Linear Optimization (LO) problems. Due to their inexact nature, QLSAs can be applied only to inexact variants of IPMs. Existing IPMs with inexact Newton directions are infeasible methods due to the inexact nature of their computations. This paper proposes an Inexact-Feasible IPM (IF-IPM) for LO problems, using a novel linear system to generate inexact but feasible steps. We show that this method has $\Ocal(\sqrt{n}L)$ iteration complexity, analogous to the best exact IPMs, where $n$ is the number of variables and $L$ is the binary length of the input data. Moreover, we examine how QLSAs can efficiently solve the proposed system in an iterative refinement (IR) scheme to find the exact solution without excessive calls to QLSAs. We show that the proposed IR-IF-IPM can also be helpful to mitigate the impact of the condition number when a classical iterative method, such as a Conjugate Gradient method or a quantum solver is used at iterations of IPMs. After applying the proposed IF-IPM to the self-dual embedding formulation, we investigate the proposed IF-IPM's efficiency using the QISKIT simulator of QLSA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17229v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moment-SOS (sum of squares) hierarchy is a powerful approach for solving globally non-convex polynomial optimization problems (POPs) at the price of solving a family of convex semidefinite optimization problems (called moment-SOS relaxations) of increasing size, controlled by an integer, the relaxation order. We say that a relaxation of a given order is exact if solving the relaxation actually solves the POP globally. In this note, we study the geometry of the exactness cone, defined as the set of polynomial objective functions for which the relaxation is exact. Generalizing previous foundational work on quadratic optimization on real varieties, we prove by elementary arguments that the exactness cones are unions of semidefinite representable cones monotonically embedded for increasing relaxation order.</description>

      <title>Solving Two-Stage Stochastic Programs with Endogenous Uncertainty via Random Variable Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15486v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world decision-making problems often involve decision-dependent uncertainty, where the probability distribution of the random vector depends on the model decisions. Few studies focus on two-stage stochastic programs with this type of endogenous uncertainty, and those that do lack general methodologies. We propose a general method for solving a class of these programs based on random variable transformation, a technique widely employed in probability and statistics. The random variable transformation converts a stochastic program with endogenous uncertainty (original program) into an equivalent stochastic program with decision-independent uncertainty (transformed program), for which solution procedures are well-studied. Additionally, endogenous uncertainty usually leads to nonlinear nonconvex programs, which are theoretically intractable. Nonetheless, we show that, for some classical endogenous distributions, the proposed method yields mixed-integer linear or convex programs with exogenous uncertainty. We validate this method by applying it to a network design and facility-protection problem, considering distinct decision-dependent distributions for the random variables. While the original formulation of this problem is nonlinear nonconvex for most endogenous distributions, the proposed method transforms it into mixed-integer linear programs with exogenous uncertainty. We solve these transformed programs with the sample average approximation method. We highlight the superior performance of our approach compared to solving the original program in the case a mixed-integer linear formulation of this program exists.</description>

      <title>Schr{\"o}dinger eigenfunctions sharing the same modulus and applications to the control of quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate when linearly independent eigenfunctions of the Schr\''odinger operator may have the same modulus. General properties are established and the one-dimensional case is treated in full generality. The study is motivated by its application to the bilinear control of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation. By assuming that the potentials of interaction satisfy a saturation property and by adapting a strategy recently proposed by Duca and Nersesyan, we discuss when the system can be steered arbitrarily fast between energy levels. Extensions of the previous results to quantum graphs are finally presented.</description>

      <title>Sequential Decision-Making under Uncertainty: A Robust MDPs review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00940v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fueled by advances in both robust optimization theory and reinforcement learning (RL), robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) have garnered increasing attention due to their powerful capability for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and recent developments in RMDPs, with a particular emphasis on ambiguity modeling. We examine the ``rectangular assumption", a key condition ensuring computational tractability in RMDPs but often resulting in overly conservative policies. Three widely used rectangular forms are summarized, and a novel proof is provided for the NP-hardness of non-rectangular RMDPs. We categorize RMDP formulation approaches into parametric, moment-based, and discrepancy-based models, analyzing the trade-offs associated with each representation. Beyond the traditional scope of RMDPs, we also explore recent efforts to relax rectangular assumptions and highlight emerging trends within the RMDP research community. These developments contribute to more practical and flexible modeling frameworks, complementing the classical RMDP results. Relaxing rectangular assumptions tailored to operations management is a promising area for future research, and there are also opportunities for further advances in developing fast algorithms and provably robust RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of infinite-dimensional systems under quantization and packet loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of stabilizing infinite-dimensional systems with input and output quantization. The closed-loop system we consider is subject to packet loss, whose average duration is assumed to be bounded. Given a bound on the initial state, we propose a design method for dynamic quantizers with zoom parameters. We show that the closed-loop state starting in a given region exponentially converges to zero if bounds on quantization errors and packet-loss intervals satisfy suitable conditions. Since the norms of the operators representing the system dynamics are used in the proposed quantizer design, we also present methods for approximately computing the operator norms.</description>

      <title>Randomized Gradient Descents on Riemannian Manifolds: Almost Sure Convergence to Global Minima in and beyond Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze convergence of gradient-descent methods on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we study randomization of Riemannian gradient algorithms for minimizing smooth cost functions (of Morse-Bott type). We prove that randomized gradient descent methods, where the Riemannian gradient is replaced by a random projection of it, converge to a single local optimum almost surely despite the existence of saddle points. We consider both uniformly distributed and discrete random projections. We also discuss the time required to pass a saddle point. As a major application, we consider ground-state preparation through quantum optimization over the unitary group. In mathematical terms our randomized algorithm applied to the trace function $U \to \operatorname{tr}(AU\rho U^*)$ almost surely converges to its global minimum. The minimum corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue (ground state) of the selfadjoint operator $A$ (Hamiltonian) if $\rho$ is a rank-one projector (pure state). In this setting, one can efficiently replace the uniform random projections by implementing so-called discrete unitary 2-designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic (SLQ) differential games with Markovian jumps. Open-loop and closed-loop solvabilities are studied by employing a new ``decomposition method", which decomposes the open-loop and closed-loop solvability problems of zero-sum SLQ differential games into two coupled SLQ control problems. Under the uniform convexity-concavity condition, we construct the open-loop saddle point along with its closed-loop representation based on the solution to a system of constrained coupled differential Riccati equations (CDREs), whose solvability is also established by employing the dimension extension technique and the continuation method. Finally, we provide a concrete example and present its closed-form saddle point based on the theoretical results obtained.</description>

      <title>An ADMM-Based Approach to Quadratically-Regularized Distributed Optimal Transport on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport on a graph focuses on finding the most efficient way to transfer resources from one distribution to another while considering the graph's structure. This paper introduces a new distributed algorithm that solves the optimal transport problem on directed, strongly connected graphs, unlike previous approaches which were limited to bipartite graphs. Our algorithm incorporates quadratic regularization and guarantees convergence using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Notably, it proves convergence not only with quadratic regularization but also in cases without it, whereas earlier works required strictly convex objective functions.
  In this approach, nodes are treated as agents that collaborate through local interactions to optimize the total transportation cost, relying only on information from their neighbors. Through numerical experiments, we show how quadratic regularization affects both convergence behavior and solution sparsity under different graph structures. Additionally, we provide a practical example that highlights the algorithm's robustness through its ability to adjust to topological changes in the graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce QICS (Quantum Information Conic Solver), an open-source primal-dual interior point solver fully implemented in Python, which is focused on solving optimization problems arising in quantum information theory. QICS has the ability to solve optimization problems involving the quantum relative entropy, noncommutative perspectives of operator convex functions, and related functions. It also includes an efficient semidefinite programming solver which exploits sparsity, as well as support for Hermitian matrices. QICS is also currently supported by the Python optimization modelling software PICOS. This paper aims to document the implementation details of the algorithm and cone oracles used in QICS, and serve as a reference guide for the software. Additionally, we showcase extensive numerical experiments which demonstrate that QICS outperforms state-of-the-art quantum relative entropy programming solvers, and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art semidefinite programming solvers.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of ODE Solutions and Quantities of Interest with Respect to Component Functions in the Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work analyzes the sensitivities of the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs. This extends existing ODE sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the ODE solution with respect to state-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carath\'eodory-type assumptions on the ODEs, the Implicit Function Theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fr\'echet differentiability of the ODE solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the ODE solution or QoI when the component function is perturbed. In applications, this new sensitivity-based bound on the ODE solution or QoI error is often much tighter than classical Gronwall-type error bounds. The sensitivity-based error bounds are applied to Zermelo's problem and to a trajectory simulation for a hypersonic vehicle.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stochastic Optimization over Unreliable Networks via Two-timescales Updates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a robust two-timescale compressed primal-dual (TiCoPD) algorithm tailored for decentralized optimization under bandwidth-limited and unreliable channels. By integrating the majorization-minimization approach with the primal-dual optimization framework, the TiCoPD algorithm strategically compresses the difference term shared among agents to enhance communication efficiency and robustness against noisy channels without compromising convergence stability. The method incorporates a mirror sequence for agent consensus on nonlinearly compressed terms updated on a fast timescale, together with a slow timescale primal-dual recursion for optimizing the objective function. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary solution when the objective function is smooth but possibly non-convex. Numerical experiments corroborate the conclusions of this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss kinetic-based particle optimization methods and variable-sample strategies for problems where the cost function represents the expected value of a random mapping. Kinetic-based optimization methods rely on a consensus mechanism targeting the global minimizer, and they exploit tools of kinetic theory to establish a rigorous framework for proving convergence to that minimizer. Variable-sample strategies replace the expected value by an approximation at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. We combine these approaches and introduce a novel algorithm based on instantaneous collisions governed by a linear Boltzmann-type equation. After proving the convergence of the resulting kinetic method under appropriate parameter constraints, we establish a connection to a recently introduced consensus-based method for solving the random problem in a suitable scaling. Finally, we showcase its enhanced computational efficiency compared to the aforementioned algorithm and validate the consistency of the proposed modeling approaches through several numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: The behaviour of the moment-sums-of-squares (moment-SOS) hierarchy for polynomial optimal control problems on compact sets has been explored to a large extent. Our contribution focuses on the case of non-compact control sets. We describe a new approach to optimal control problems with unbounded controls, using compactification by partial homogenization, leading to an equivalent infinite dimensional linear program with compactly supported measures. Our results are closely related to the results of a previous approach using DiPerna-Majda measures. However, our work provides a sound proof of the absence of relaxation gap, which was conjectured in the previous work, and thereby enables the design of a moment-sum-of-squares relaxation with guaranteed convergence.</description>

      <title>Krasovski\u{i} Stability Theorem for FDEs in the Extended Sense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of the stability of systems' equilibria plays a central role in the study of dynamical systems and control theory. This note establishes an extension of the celebrated Krasovski\u{\i} stability theorem for functional differential equations (FDEs) in the extended sense. Namely, the FDEs hold for $t \geq t_0$ almost everywhere with respect to the Lebesgue measure. The existence and uniqueness of such FDEs were briefly discussed in J.K Hale's classical treatise on FDEs, yet a corresponding stability theorem was not provided. A key step in proving the proposed stability theorem was to utilize an alternative strategy instead of relying on the mean value theorem of differentiable functions. The proposed theorem can be useful in the stability analysis of cybernetic systems, which are often subject to noise and glitches that have a countably infinite number of jumps. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed theorem, we provide examples of linear systems with time-varying delays in which the FDEs cannot be defined in the conventional sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14377v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that functions (resp. operators) satisfying a property~$p$ on a subset $Q\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ cannot necessarily be extended to a function (resp. operator) satisfying~$p$ on the whole of~$\mathbb{R}^d$. Given $Q \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, this work considers the problem of obtaining necessary and ideally sufficient conditions to be satisfied by a function (resp. operator) on $Q$, ensuring the existence of an extension of this function (resp. operator) satisfying $p$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  More precisely, given some property $p$, we present a refinement procedure to obtain stronger necessary conditions to be imposed on $Q$. This procedure can be applied iteratively until the stronger conditions are also sufficient. We illustrate the procedure on a few examples, including the strengthening of existing descriptions for the classes of smooth functions satisfying a \L{}ojasiewicz condition, convex blockwise smooth functions, Lipschitz monotone operators, strongly monotone cocoercive operators, and uniformly convex functions.
  In most cases, these strengthened descriptions can be represented, or relaxed, to semi-definite constraints, which can be used to formulate tractable optimization problems on functions (resp. operators) within those classes.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of an Inexact MBA Method for Constrained DC Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns a class of constrained difference-of-convex (DC) optimization problems in which, the constraint functions are continuously differentiable and their gradients are strictly continuous. For such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, we develop an inexact moving balls approximation (MBA) method by a workable inexactness criterion for the solution of subproblems. This criterion is proposed by leveraging a global error bound for the strongly convex program associated with parametric optimization problems. We establish the full convergence of the iterate sequence under the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property of the constructed potential function, achieve the local convergence rate of the iterate and objective value sequences under the KL property of the potential function with exponent $q\in[1/2,1)$, and provide the iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ to seek an $\epsilon$-KKT point. A verifiable condition is also presented to check whether the potential function has the KL property of exponent $q\in[1/2,1)$. To our knowledge, this is the first implementable inexact MBA method with a complete convergence certificate. Numerical comparison with DCA-MOSEK, a DC algorithm with subproblems solved by MOSEK, is conducted on $\ell_1\!-\!\ell_2$ regularized quadratically constrained optimization problems, which demonstrates the advantage of the inexact MBA in the quality of solutions and running time.</description>

Abstract: This papers outlines a novel extension of the classical Pontryagin minimum (maximum) principle to stochastic optimal control problems. Contrary to the well-known stochastic Pontryagin minimum principle involving forward-backward stochastic differential equations, the proposed formulation is deterministic and of mean-field type. We denote it the McKean-Pontryagin minimum principle. The Hamiltonian structure of the proposed McKean-Pontryagin minimum principle is achieved via the introduction of an appropriate gauge variable. The gauge freedom can be used to decouple the forward and reverse time equations; hence simplifying the solution of the underlying boundary value problem. We also consider infinite horizon discounted cost optimal control problems. In this case, the mean-field formulation allows converting the computation of the desired optimal control law into solving a pair of forward mean-field ordinary differential equations. The McKean-Pontryagin minimum principle is tested numerically for a controlled inverted pendulum and a controlled Lorenz-63 system.</description>

      <title>Convex Submodular Minimization with Indicator Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a general class of convex submodular optimization problems with indicator variables. Many applications such as the problem of inferring Markov random fields (MRFs) with a sparsity or robustness prior can be naturally modeled in this form. We show that these problems can be reduced to binary submodular minimization problems, possibly after a suitable reformulation, and thus are strongly polynomially solvable. %We also discuss the implication of our results in the case of quadratic objectives. Furthermore, we develop a parametric approach for computing the associated extreme bases under certain smoothness conditions. This leads to a fast solution method, whose efficiency is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the convex relaxation of the barrier parameter functional of self-concordant barriers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-concordant barriers are essential for interior-point algorithms in conic programming. To speed up the convergence it is of interest to find a barrier with the lowest possible parameter for a given cone. The barrier parameter is a non-convex function on the set of self-concordant barriers on a given cone, and finding an optimal barrier amounts to solving a non-convex infinite-dimensional optimization problem. In this work we study the degradation of the optimal value of the problem when the problem is convexified, and provide an estimate of the accuracy of the convex relaxation. The amount of degradation can be computed by comparing a 1-parameter family of non-convex bodies in $R^3$ with their convex hulls. Our study provides insight into the degree of non-convexity of the problem and opens up the possibility of constructing suboptimal barriers by solving the convex relaxation</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization for Coordinated Long-Term and Short-Term Isolated Microgrid Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-anticipatory long-short-term coordinated dispatch framework for isolated microgrid with hybrid short-long-duration energy storages (LDES). We introduce a convex hull approximation model for nonconvex LDES electrochemical dynamics, facilitating computational tractability and accuracy. To address temporal coupling in SoC dynamics and long-term contracts, we generate hindsight-optimal state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories of LDES and netloads for offline training. In the online stage, we employ kernel regression to dynamically update the SoC reference and propose an adaptive online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm with SoC reference tracking and expert tracking to mitigate myopia and enable adaptive step-size optimization. We rigorously prove that both long-term and short-term policies achieve sublinear regret bounds over time, which improves with more regression scenarios, stronger tracking penalties, and finer convex approximations. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing costs by 73.4%, eliminating load loss via reference tracking, and achieving an additional 2.4% cost saving via the OCO algorithm. These benefits scale up with longer LDES durations, and the method demonstrates resilience to poor forecasts and unexpected system faults.</description>

Abstract: We construct a weak KAM theory for parameterized cobordisms and their relaxation, holonomic measures. We find a weak kam solution in that context, and we show that in many cases it corresponds to an exact form that satisfies a version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Along the way, we give a characterization of minimizable Lagrangians, as well as some abstract weak KAM machinery.</description>

      <title>On Covering Euclidean Space with Q-arrangements of Cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a covering problem of Euclidean space by a particular arrangement of cones that are not necessarily full and are allowed to overlap. The problem provides an equivalent geometric reformulation of the solvability of the linear complementarity problem defining the class of Q-matrices. Assuming feasibility, we rely on standard tools from convex geometry to study maximal connected uncovered regions, we term \emph{holes}. We then use our approach to fully characterize the problem for dimension $3$, regardless of degeneracy. We further provide, for $n \leq 3$, an algebraic characterization for the class of Q-matrices. That is, we show that, $M$ is a Q-matrix if and only if its entries belong to an explicit semi-algebraic set (in dimension $9$) where all the involved polynomials are subdeterminants of $M$. We showcase the usefulness of such a characterization by generating $3$-by-$3$ Q-matrices with specific interesting properties on the involved cones.</description>

      <title>On time-consistent equilibrium stopping under aggregation of diverse discount rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a central planner's decision making on behalf of a group of members with diverse discount rates. In the context of optimal stopping, we work with an aggregation preference to incorporate all discount rates via an attitude function that reflects the aggregation rule chosen by the central planner. The problem formulation is also applicable to single agent's stopping problem with uncertain discount rate, where our aggregation preference coincides with the conventional smooth ambiguity preference. The resulting optimal stopping problem is time inconsistent, for which we develop an iterative approach using consistent planning and characterize all time-consistent mild equilibria as fixed points of an operator in the setting of one-dimensional diffusion processes. We provide some sufficient conditions on the underlying models and the attitude function such that the smallest mild equilibrium attains the optimal equilibrium. In addition, we show that the optimal equilibrium is a weak equilibrium. When the sufficient condition of the attitude function is violated, we illustrate by various examples that the characterization of the optimal equilibrium may differ significantly from some existing results for a single agent, which now sensitively depends on the attitude function and the diversity distribution of discount rates within the group.</description>

      <title>The geometry of financial institutions -- Wasserstein clustering of financial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of granular and big data on various objects of interest has made it necessary to develop methods for condensing this information into a representative and intelligible map. Financial regulation is a field that exemplifies this need, as regulators require diverse and often highly granular data from financial institutions to monitor and assess their activities. However, processing and analyzing such data can be a daunting task, especially given the challenges of dealing with missing values and identifying clusters based on specific features.
  To address these challenges, we propose a variant of Lloyd's algorithm that applies to probability distributions and uses generalized Wasserstein barycenters to construct a metric space which represents given data on various objects in condensed form. By applying our method to the financial regulation context, we demonstrate its usefulness in dealing with the specific challenges faced by regulators in this domain. We believe that our approach can also be applied more generally to other fields where large and complex data sets need to be represented in concise form.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev approximation by non-Chebyshev systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of the best uniform approximation by linear combinations of a finite system of functions. If the system is Chebyshev and the problem is unconstrained, then the classical Remez algorithm provides a fast and precise solution. For non-Chebyshev systems, this problem may offer a great resistance. The same happens to approximations under linear constraints. We propose a solution by modifying the concept of alternance and of the Remez iterative procedure. A criterion of the best approximation is proved and the full set of polynomials of best approximation (which may not be unique in the non-Chebyshev case) is characterized. The method of finding the best polynomial is applicable for arbitrary functional systems under arbitrary linear constraints. The efficiency is demonstrated in examples with systems of complex exponents, Gaussian functions, and lacunar polynomials. As an application, the Markov-Bernstein type inequalities are obtained for those systems. Applications to signal processing, linear ODEs, switching dynamical systems are considered.</description>

      <title>Structured Difference-of-Q via Orthogonal Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning is important in many settings with available observational data but the inability to deploy new policies online due to safety, cost, and other concerns. Many recent advances in causal inference and machine learning target estimation of causal contrast functions such as CATE, which is sufficient for optimizing decisions and can adapt to potentially smoother structure. We develop a dynamic generalization of the R-learner (Nie and Wager 2021, Lewis and Syrgkanis 2021) for estimating and optimizing the difference of $Q^\pi$-functions, $Q^\pi(s,1)-Q^\pi(s,0)$ (which can be used to optimize multiple-valued actions). We leverage orthogonal estimation to improve convergence rates in the presence of slower nuisance estimation rates and prove consistency of policy optimization under a margin condition. The method can leverage black-box nuisance estimators of the $Q$-function and behavior policy to target estimation of a more structured $Q$-function contrast.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13120v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the degenerate preconditioned proximal point (PPP) method provides a unified and flexible framework for designing and analyzing operator-splitting algorithms such as Douglas-Rachford (DR). However, the degenerate PPP method exhibits weak convergence in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and lacks accelerated variants. To address these issues, we propose a Halpern-type PPP (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence and acceleration properties of Halpern's iteration method. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for image restoration by combining HPPP with denoiser priors such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) prior, which can be viewed as an accelerated PnP method. Finally, numerical experiments including several toy examples and image restoration validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Multiple DER Aggregators on Wholesale Energy Markets: A Hybrid Mean Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy markets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV panels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to ensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We study a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each controlling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf of the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the repeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and adapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other and with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping wholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We model this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses market information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants -- to enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed decisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their portfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control (MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal strategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market conditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly reach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field learning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without storage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop and present a novel regularization scheme for ill-posed inverse problems governed by nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). In our recent work, we introduced a bi-level regularization framework. This study significantly improves upon the bi-level algorithm by sequentially initializing the lower-level problem, yielding accelerated convergence and demonstrable multi-scale effect, while retaining regularizing effect and allows for the usage of inexact PDE solvers. Moreover, by collecting the lower-level trajectory, we uncover an interesting connection to the incremental load method. The sequential bi-level approach illustrates its universality through several reaction-diffusion applications, in which the nonlinear reaction law needs to be determined. We moreover prove that the proposed tangential cone condition is satisfied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and uniqueness of the barycenter of a signed distribution of probability measures on a Hilbert space. The barycenter is found, as usual, as a minimum of a functional. In the case where the positive part of the signed measure is atomic, we can show also uniqueness. In the one-dimensional case, we characterize the quantile function of the unique minimum as the orthogonal projection of the $L^2$-barycenter of the quantiles on the cone of nonincreasing functions in $L^2(0,1)$. Further, we provide a stability estimate in dimension one and a counterexample to uniqueness in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Finally, we address the consistency of the barycenters and we prove that barycenters of a sequence of approximating measures converge (up to subsequences) to a barycenter of the limit measure.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there is no relaxation gap between a quasi-dissipative nonlinear evolution equation in a Hilbert space and its linear Liouville equation reformulation on probability measures. In other words, strong and generalized solutions of such equations are unique in the class of measure-valued solutions. As a major consequence, non-convex numerical optimization over these non-linear partial differential equations can be carried out with the infinite-dimensional moment-SOS hierarchy with global convergence guarantees. This covers in particular all reaction-diffusion equations with polynomial nonlinearity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of bundle adjustment (i.e., simultaneous refinement of camera poses and scene map) for a purely rotating event camera. Starting from first principles, we formulate the problem as a classical non-linear least squares optimization. The photometric error is defined using the event generation model directly in the camera rotations and the semi-dense scene brightness that triggers the events. We leverage the sparsity of event data to design a tractable Levenberg-Marquardt solver that handles the very large number of variables involved. To the best of our knowledge, our method, which we call Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment (EPBA), is the first event-only photometric bundle adjustment method that works on the brightness map directly and exploits the space-time characteristics of event data, without having to convert events into image-like representations. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EPBA's effectiveness in decreasing the photometric error (by up to 90%), yielding results of unparalleled quality. The refined maps reveal details that were hidden using prior state-of-the-art rotation-only estimation methods. The experiments on modern high-resolution event cameras show the applicability of EPBA to panoramic imaging in various scenarios (without map initialization, at multiple resolutions, and in combination with other methods, such as IMU dead reckoning or previous event-based rotation estimation methods). We make the source code publicly available. https://github.com/tub-rip/epba</description>

      <title>Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent Beyond Compatible Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern policy optimization methods roughly follow the policy mirror descent (PMD) algorithmic template, for which there are by now numerous theoretical convergence results. However, most of these either target tabular environments, or can be applied effectively only when the class of policies being optimized over satisfies strong closure conditions, which is typically not the case when working with parametric policy classes in large-scale environments. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for PMD for general policy classes where we replace the closure conditions with a strictly weaker variational gradient dominance assumption, and obtain upper bounds on the rate of convergence to the best-in-class policy. Our main result leverages a novel notion of smoothness with respect to a local norm induced by the occupancy measure of the current policy, and casts PMD as a particular instance of smooth non-convex optimization in non-Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Modeling Driver Behavior in Speed Advisory Systems: Koopman-based Approach with Online Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate driver behavior modeling is essential for improving the interaction and cooperation of the human driver with the driver assistance system. This paper presents a novel approach for modeling the response of human drivers to visual cues provided by a speed advisory system using a Koopman-based method with online updates. The proposed method utilizes the Koopman operator to transform the nonlinear dynamics of driver-speed advisory system interactions into a linear framework, allowing for efficient real-time prediction. An online update mechanism based on Recursive Least Squares (RLS) is integrated into the Koopman-based model to ensure continuous adaptation to changes in driver behavior over time. The model is validated using data collected from a human-in-the-loop driving simulator, capturing diverse driver-specific trajectories. The results demonstrate that the offline learned Koopman-based model can closely predict driver behavior and its accuracy is further enhanced through an online update mechanism with the RLS method.</description>

      <title>Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored Non-Markovian Quantum Systems with a Markovian Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system. Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) is determined by the ``diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the ``off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Gradient Descent on Learning Transformers with Residual Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization. Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.</description>

      <title>Subspace-constrained randomized coordinate descent for linear systems with good low-rank matrix approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The randomized coordinate descent (RCD) method is a classical algorithm with simple, lightweight iterations that is widely used for various optimization problems, including the solution of positive semidefinite linear systems. As a linear solver, RCD is particularly effective when the matrix is well-conditioned; however, its convergence rate deteriorates rapidly in the presence of large spectral outliers. In this paper, we introduce the subspace-constrained randomized coordinate descent (SC-RCD) method, in which the dynamics of RCD are restricted to an affine subspace corresponding to a column Nystr\"{o}m approximation, efficiently computed using the recently analyzed RPCholesky algorithm. We prove that SC-RCD converges at a rate that is unaffected by large spectral outliers, making it an effective and memory-efficient solver for large-scale, dense linear systems with rapidly decaying spectra, such as those encountered in kernel ridge regression. Experimental validation and comparisons with related solvers based on coordinate descent and the conjugate gradient method demonstrate the efficiency of SC-RCD. Our theoretical results are derived by developing a more general subspace-constrained framework for the sketch-and-project method. This framework generalizes popular algorithms such as randomized Kaczmarz and coordinate descent, and provides a flexible, implicit preconditioning strategy for a variety of iterative solvers, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Analytic Full Potential Adjoint Solution for Two-dimensional Subcritical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytic properties of adjoint solutions are investigated for the two-dimensional (2D) full potential equation. For subcritical flows, the Green's function approach is used to derive the analytic adjoint solution for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force. The connection of the adjoint problems for the potential flow equation and the compressible adjoint Euler equations reveals that the adjoint potential and stream function correspond to linear combinations of the compressible adjoint variables measuring the influence of point mass and vorticity sources. The solutions for the adjoint potential and stream function corresponding to aerodynamic lift contain two unknown functions encoding the effect of perturbations to the Kutta condition. The properties of these functions are analyzed from an analytic viewpoint and also by examining numerical adjoint solutions. Based on this analysis, a possible formulation of the Kutta condition within the adjoint framework is also discussed.</description>

      <title>GPU-based complete search for nonlinear minimization subject to bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency, the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10 benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU architecture.</description>
