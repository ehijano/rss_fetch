      <title>On the Jucys-Murphy method and fusion procedure for the Sergeev superalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Jucys-Murphy elements to construct a complete set of primitive idempotents for the Sergeev superalgebra. We apply them to give a version of the seminormal form for the irreducible modules with an explicit construction of basis vectors. We show that the idempotents can also be obtained from a new version of the fusion procedure.</description>

      <title>Intertwining operators for representations of covering groups of reductive $p$-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a covering group of a reductive $p$-adic group. We study intertwining operators between parabolically induced representations of $G$ and prove that they satisfy certain adjointness relations. The Harish-Chandra $\mu$-function is defined as a composition of such intertwining operators for opposite parabolic subgroups of $G$. It can be seen as a complex rational function and we give an explicit formula for it in terms of poles and zeros. The adjointness of the intertwining operators is an important ingredient to prove the formula for the $\mu$-function. To locate the poles of $\mu$, we construct a continuous family of Hermitian forms on a family of parabolically induced representations.</description>

      <title>Weyl Quantization of Exponential Lie Groups for Square Integrable Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a general quantization procedure for square integrable functions on well-behaved connected exponential Lie groups. The Lie groups in question should admit at least one co-adjoint orbit of maximal possible dimension. The construction is based on composing the Fourier-Wigner transform with another Fourier transform we call the Fourier-Kirillov transform. This quantization has many desirable properties including respecting function translations and inducing a well-behaved Wigner distribution.
  Moreover, we investigate the connection to the operator convolutions of quantum harmonic analysis. This is intricately connected to Weyl quantization in the Weyl-Heisenberg setting. We find that convolution relations in quantum harmonic analysis can be written as group convolutions of Weyl quantizations. This implies that the squared modulus of the wavelet transform of the representation can be written as a convolution between two Wigner distributions. Lastly, we look at how we can extend known results based on Weyl quantization to wider classes of groups using our quantization procedure.</description>

      <title>Chevalley operations on TNN Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lusztig showed that invertible totally nonnegative (TNN) matrices form a semigroup generated by positive diagonal matrices and Chevalley generators. From its Grassmann analogue, we introduce Chevalley operations on index sets, which we show have a rich variety of applications. We first completely classify all inequalities that are quadratic in Plucker coordinates over the TNN part of the Grassmannian: \[\sum_{I,J}c_{I,J}\Delta_I\Delta_J\ge 0\quad over\quad \mathrm{Gr}^{\ge 0}(m,m+n)\] where each $c_{I,J}$ is real, and $\Delta_I,\Delta_J$ are Plucker coordinates with a homogeneity condition. Using an idea of Gekhtman-Shapiro-Vainshtein, we also explain how our Chevalley operations can be motivated from cluster mutations, and lead to working in Grassmannians of smaller dimension, akin to cluster algebras.
  We then present several applications of Chevalley operations. First, we obtain certificates for the above inequalities via sums of coefficients $c_{I,J}$ over 321-avoiding permutations and involutions; we believe this refined results of Rhoades-Skandera for TNN-matrix inequalities via their Temperley-Lieb immanant idea.
  Second, we provide a novel proof via Chevalley operations of Lam's log-supermodularity of Plucker coordinates. This has several consequences: (a) Each positroid, corresponding to the positroid cells in Postnikov's decomposition of the TNN Grassmannian, is a distributive lattice. (b) It also yields numerical positivity in the main result of Lam-Postnikov-Pylyavskyy. (c) We show the coordinatewise monotonicity of ratios of Schur polynomials, first proved by Khare-Tao and which is the key result they use to obtain quantitative estimates for positivity preservers.
  Third, we employ Chevalley operations to show that the majorization order over partitions implicates a partial order for induced character immanants over TNN matrices, proved originally by Skandera-Soskin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the general shift orbifold of a Narain CFT and use this to investigate decompactification limits in the heterotic Narain moduli space. We also comment on higher rank theories and describe some applications to the CFT based on the Leech lattice and its shift orbifolds.</description>

      <title>On the action of the Weyl group on canonical bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study representations of simply-laced Weyl groups which are equipped with canonical bases. Our main result is that for a large class of representations, the separable elements of the Weyl group $W$ act on these canonical bases by bijections up to lower-order terms. Examples of this phenomenon include the action of separable permutations on the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of irreducible representations for the symmetric group, and the action of separable elements of $W$ on dual canonical bases of weight zero in tensor product representations of a Lie algebra. Our methods arise from categorical representation theory, and in particular the study of the perversity of Rickard complexes acting on triangulated categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex semisimple Lie algebra and let $\mathbf{U}_q(\mathfrak{g})$ denote the associated Drinfel'd Jimbo quantized enveloping algebra. In this paper we study spherical functions of $\mathbf{U}_q(\mathfrak{g})$ related to characters. We show invariance under the Wang-Zhang braid group operators and show relative Weyl group invariance, when restricted to the quantum torus.</description>

      <title>On Morita equivalences with endopermutation source and isotypies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of equivalence between blocks of finite group algebras called an almost isotypy. An almost isotypy restricts to a weak isotypy in Brou\'{e}'s original definition, and it is slightly weaker than Linckelmann's version. We show that a bimodule of two block algebras of finite groups - which has an endopermutation module as a source and which induces a Morita equivalence - gives rise, via slash functors, to an almost isotypy if the character values of a (hence any) source are rational integers. Consequently, if two blocks are Morita equivalent via a bimodule with endopermutation source, then they are almost isotypic. We also explain why the notion of almost isotypies is reasonable.</description>

      <title>$\tau$-cluster morphism categories of factor algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take a novel lattice-theoretic approach to the $\tau$-cluster morphism category $\mathfrak{T}(A)$ of a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ and define the category via the lattice of torsion classes $\mathrm{tors } A$. Using the lattice congruence induced by an ideal $I$ of $A$ we establish a functor $F_I: \mathfrak{T}(A) \to \mathfrak{T}(A/I)$. If $\mathrm{tors } A$ is finite, $F_I$ is a regular epimorphism in the category of small categories and we characterise when $F_I$ is full and faithful. The construction is purely combinatorial, meaning that the lattice of torsion classes determines the $\tau$-cluster morphism category up to equivalence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05507v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiplicity-free representations of Lie groups over a quasi-symmetric Siegel domain, with a focus on certain two-step nilpotent Lie groups. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the multiplicity-freeness property to hold. Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the disjointness of irreducible unitary representations realized over the domain, the multiplicity-freeness of the unitary representation on the Bergman space, and the coisotropicity of the group action.</description>

      <title>Frobenius intertwiners for q-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of $q$-hypergeometric equations describing the quantum difference equation for the cotangent bundles over projective spaces $X=T^{*}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ . We show that over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ these equations are equipped with the Frobenius action $(q,z)\to (q^p,z^p)$. We obtain an explicit formula for the constant term of the Frobenius intertwiner in terms of the $p$-adic $q$-gamma function of Koblitz. In the limit $q\to 1$ we arrive at the Frobenius structures for the $p$-adic hypergeometric and Bessel differential equations studied by Dwork. In particular, we find closed formulas for $p$-adic constants appearing in works of Dwork and Sperber in terms of $p$-adic zeta functions.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the Virasoro-type reduction and the corresponding inverse reductions are established for W-algebras associated with classical Lie type and nilpotent orbits of height two. Moreover, these results are lifted to the universal objects by analyzing the Virasoro-type reduction of the vertex algebra $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$.</description>
