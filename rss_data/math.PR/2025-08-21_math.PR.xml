      <title>On tail probability of the covariance matrix in Eldan's stochastic localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eldan's stochastic localization is a new kind of stochastic evolution in the space of probability measures which provides a novel way to study high dimensional convex body. A central object in the study of the stochastic localization is the stochastic process of its covariance matrix. The main result of this paper is some exponential-type tail probability estimate of the covariance process for the general time. This estimate implies a weaker version of a $p$-moment conjecture by Klartag and Lehec. The stochastic localization considered here is a simplified version by Lee and Vemplala.</description>

      <title>Activated random walk on the comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density conjecture for activated random walk on the interval was recently resolved using a new tool called layer percolation. As a step towards understanding how layer percolation extends to activated random walk on more complex graphs, we develop its analog for the comb graph and use it to prove bounds on the critical density. Additionally, we provide simulation evidence suggesting that the comb has different critical densities on its spine and teeth, both of which are smaller than the critical density for the interval.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for random Dirichlet series with summation over primes, with an application to Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that two conjectures put forward in the recent article Iksanov and Kostohryz (2025) are true. Namely, we prove a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) and a law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for a random Dirichlet series $\sum_p \frac{\eta_p}{p^{1/2+s}}$ as $s\to 0+$, where $\eta_1$, $\eta_2,\ldots$ are independent identically distributed random variables with zero mean and finite variance, and $\sum_p$ denotes the summation over the prime numbers. As a consequence, an FCLT and an LIL are obtained for $\log \sum_{n\geq 1} \frac{f(n)}{n^{1/2+s}}$ as $s\to 0+$, where $f$ is a Rademacher random multiplicative function.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis on narrow tubes: narrow escape problems and diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a diffusion process in a narrow tubular domain with reflecting boundary conditions, where the geometry serves as a singular perturbation of an underlying graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$. The construction incorporates distinct scaling regimes in the neighborhoods of the graph's vertices and edges. We show that, in the limit, the projected process converges weakly to a diffusion process on the graph, with gluing conditions at the vertices that depend on the relative scales of the neighborhoods. Our analysis relies on a detailed understanding of the narrow escape problem in domains with bottlenecks. In particular, we rigorously derive the asymptotic behavior of the expected escape time, establish the asymptotic exponential distribution of escape times and obtain exit place estimates, results that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the maximal displacement of subcritical branching random walks with or without killing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a subcritical branching random walk $\{Z_k\}_{k\geq 0}$ with offspring distribution $\{p_k\}_{k\geq 0}$ and step size $X$. Let $M_n$ denote the rightmost position reached by $\{Z_k\}_{k\geq 0}$ up to generation $n$, and define $M := \sup_{n\geq 0} M_n$. In this paper we give asymptotics of tail probability of $M$ under optimal assumptions $\sum^{\infty}_{k=1}(k\log k) p_k&lt;\infty$ and $\mathbb{E}[Xe^{\gamma X}]&lt;\infty$, where $\gamma &gt;0$ is a constant such that $\mathbb{E}[e^{\gamma X}]=\frac{1}{m}$ and $m=\sum_{k=0}^\infty kp_k\in (0,1)$. Moreover, we confirm the conjecture of Neuman and Zheng [Probab. Theory Related Fields. 167 (2017) 1137--1164] by establishing the existence of a critical value $m\mathbb{E}[X e^{\gamma X}]$ such that
  \begin{align*}
  \lim_{n\to\infty}e^{\gamma cn}\mathbb{P}(M_n\geq cn)= \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;\kappa \in(0,1], &amp;c\in\big(0,m\mathbb{E}[Xe^{\gamma X}]\big);
  &amp;0, &amp;c\in\big(m\mathbb{E}[Xe^{\gamma X}],\infty\big),
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{align*}
  where $\kappa$ represents the non-zero limit. Finally, we extend these results to the maximal displacement of branching random walks with killing. Interestingly, this limit can be characterized through both the global minimum of a random walk with positive drift and the maximal displacement of the branching random walk without killing.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for path-dependent multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns a type of path-dependent multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations. First of all, we prove the well-posedness for path-dependent multivalued stochastic differential equations under the Lipschitz conditions. Then by constructing Lipschitz approximation sequences, we generalize the result to the case of the non-Lipschitz conditions. Finally, based on the obtained results, the well-posedness for path-dependent multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations under the non-Lipschitz conditions is established by iterating in distributions.</description>

      <title>Interface fluctuations for $1$D stochastic Allen-Cahn equation -- singular regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interface fluctuations for the $1$D stochastic Allen-Cahn equation perturbed by half a spatial derivative of the spacetime white noise. This half derivative makes the solution distribution-valued, so that proper renormalization is needed to make sense of the solution.
  We show that if the noise is sufficiently small, then an analogue of the classical results by \cite{Fun95,BBDMP98} holds in this singular regime. More precisely, for initial data close to the traveling wave solution of the deterministic equation, under proper long time scaling, the solution still stays close to the family of traveling waves, and the interface location moves according to an approximate diffusion process. There is one interesting difference between our singular regime and the classical situation: even if the solution and its approximate phase separation point are both well defined, the intended diffusion describing the movement of the canonical candidate of the phase point is not (even for fixed $\eps$). Two infinite quantities arise from the derivation of such an SDE, one due to singularity of the noise, and the other from renormalization. Magically, it turns out that they cancel out each other, thus making the derivation of the interface SDE valid in the $\eps \rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

      <title>Large deviation rates for supercritical multitype branching processes with immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{X_n\}_{n\geq0}$ be a $p$-type ($p\geq2$) supercritical branching process with immigration and mean matrix $M$. Suppose that $M$ is positively regular and $\rho$ is the maximal eigenvalue of $M$ with the corresponding left and right eigenvectors $\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\boldsymbol{u}$. Let $\rho&gt;1$ and $Y_n=\rho^{-n}\Big[\boldsymbol{u}\cdot X_n -\frac{\rho^{n+1}-1}{\rho-1}( \boldsymbol{u}\cdot \boldsymbol{\lambda})\Big]$, where the vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ denotes the mean immigration rate. In this paper, we will show that $Y_n$ is a martingale and converges to a $r.v.$ $Y$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. We study the rates of convergence to $0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ of
  $$
  P_i\Big(\Big|\frac{\boldsymbol{l}\cdot X_{n+1}}{\textbf{1}\cdot X_n}-\frac{\boldsymbol{l}\cdot(X_nM)}{\textbf{1}\cdot X_n}\Big|&gt;\varepsilon\Big),P_i\Big(\Big|\frac{\boldsymbol{l}\cdot X_n}{\textbf{1}\cdot X_n}-\frac{\boldsymbol{l}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}}{\textbf{1}\cdot \boldsymbol{v} }\Big|&gt;\varepsilon\Big),P\Big(\Big|Y_n-Y\Big|&gt;\varepsilon\Big)
  $$
  for any $\varepsilon&gt;0, i=1,\cdots,p$, $\textbf{1}=(1,\cdots,1)$ and $\boldsymbol{l}\in\mathbb{R}^p,$ the $p$-dimensional Euclidean space. It is shown that under certain moment conditions, the first two decay geometrically, while conditionally on the event $Y\geq\alpha$ $(\alpha&gt;0)$ supergeometrically. The decay rate of the last probability is always supergeometric under a finite moment generating function assumption.</description>

      <title>Generalized Meixner-type free gamma distributions:convolution formulas and potential correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of generalized Meixner-type free gamma distributions $\mu_{t,\theta,\lambda}$ ($t,\theta&gt;0$ and $\lambda\ge 1$), which includes both the free gamma distributions introduced by Anshelevich and certain scaled free beta prime distributions introduced by Yoshida. We investigate fundamental properties and mixture structures of these distributions. In particular, we consider the Gibbs distribution $\frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_{t,\theta,\lambda}} \exp\{-V_{t,\theta,\lambda}(x)\}$ associated with a family of potentials $V_{t,\theta,\lambda}$, and show that $\mu_{t,\theta,\lambda}$ maximizes Voiculescu's free entropy with potential $V_{t,\theta,\lambda}$ for parameters $t,\theta&gt;0$ and $1\le \lambda&lt;1+t/\theta$. This result substantially extends the range of classcal-free correspondences obtained the potential function, differing from those arising from the Bercovici-Pata bijection. Moreover, we identify algebraic relations involving noncommutative random variables distributed as free gamma distributions.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures and shocks in the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of invariant measures from the perspective of a shock in the KPZ fixed point. These measures are parameterized by a positive number $\theta &gt; 0$, and are supported on functions $f$ satisfying $\lim_{|x| \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{|x|} = 2\theta$. Each can be described as the sum of a Brownian motion and an independent Bessel-$3$ process with drift. We show that these measures appear as the $L \to \infty$ limit of the measures constructed by Barraquand, Corwin, and Yang for the conjectural open KPZ fixed point on $[0,L]$, after recentering by an appropriately defined shock location. Furthermore, we show that, with respect to the standard, deterministic recentering at $x = 0$, all extremal invariant measures for the KPZ fixed point are Brownian motions with drift. To do this, we first show that any extremal invariant measures must be supported on functions having fixed asymptotic slopes at $\pm \infty$. Using a one-force-one-solution principle from the work of Busani, Sepp\"al\"ainen, and the second author, this rules out all other invariant measures except those having left slope $-2\theta$ and right slope $+2\theta$ for some $\theta &gt; 0$. To handle this case, we derive the limiting fluctuations of the shock for a special choice of initial condition. Additionally, we derive the limiting fluctuations of the shock for the case of the invariant measure from the perspective of a shock, and for the case of initial data $f(x) = 2\theta|x|$.</description>

      <title>The Liouville model in the $L^1$ phase: coupling and extreme values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a strong coupling between the Liouville model and the Gaussian free field on the two dimensional torus in the $L^1$ phase $\beta \in (0, 8\pi)$, such that the difference of the two fields is a H\"older continuous function. The coupling originates from a Polchinski renormalisation group approach, which was previously used to prove analogous results for other Euclidean field theories in dimension two. Our main observations for the Liouville model are that the Polchinski flow has a definite sign and can be controlled well thanks to an FKG argument.
  The coupling allows to relate extreme values of the Liouville model and the Gaussian free field, and as an application we show that the global maximum of the Liouville field converges in distribution to a randomly shifted Gumbel distribtion.</description>

      <title>Geodesic convexity and strengthened functional inequalities in submanifolds of Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geodesic convexity of various energy and entropy functionals restricted to (non-geodesically convex) submanifolds of Wasserstein spaces with their induced geometry. We prove a variety of convexity results by means of a simple general principle, which holds in the metric space setting, and which crucially requires no knowledge of the structure of geodesics in the submanifold: If the EVI gradient flow of a functional exists and leaves the submanifold invariant, then the restriction of the functional to the submanifold is geodesically convex. This leads to short new proofs of several known results, such as one of Carlen and Gangbo on strong convexity of entropy on sphere-like submanifolds, and several new results, such as the $\lambda$-convexity of entropy on the space of couplings of $\lambda$-log-concave marginals. Along the way, we develop sufficient conditions for existence of geodesics in Wasserstein submanifolds. Submanifold convexity results lead systematically to improvements of Talagrand and HWI inequalities which we speculate to be closely related to concentration of measure estimates for conditioned empirical measures, and we prove one rigorous result in this direction in the Carlen-Gangbo setting.</description>

      <title>Ties, Tails and Spectra: On Rank-Based Dependency Measures in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the limiting spectral distribution of rank-based dependency measures in high dimensions. We provide distribution-free results for multivariate empirical versions of Kendall's $\tau$ and Spearman's $\rho$ in a setting where the dimension $p$ grows at most proportionally to the sample size $n$. Although rank-based measures are known to be well suited for discrete and heavy-tailed data, previous works in the field focused mostly on the continuous and light-tailed case. We close this gap by imposing mild assumptions and allowing for general types of distributions. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that a non-trivial adjustment of classical Kendall's $\tau$ is needed to obtain a pivotal limiting distribution in the presence of tied data. The proof for Spearman's $\rho$ is facilitated by a result regarding the limiting eigenvalue distribution of a general class of random matrices with rows on the Euclidean unit sphere, which is of independent interest. For instance, this finding can be used to derive the limiting spectral distribution of sample correlation matrices, which, in contrast to most existing works, accommodates heavy-tailed data.</description>

      <title>Functional Liftings of Restricted Geometric Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate what we term ``generalized sup-convolutions". We show that functional inequalities that enjoy an interpretation as sup-convolution inequalities can be deduced from the special case of indicator functions corresponding to a geometric inequality. As consequences we derive a Borell-Brascamp Lieb inequality for the Gaussian Brunn-Minkowski inequality and give a functional analog of the log-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture. We also show that Barthe's reverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality is equivalent to the geometric inequality it implies and give a functional formulation of a conjecture of Schneider. Though we focus on Euclidean applications, our results are general and can be directly applied in more abstract settings, like groups or even topological measure spaces without algebraic structure, we instantiate this claim with a Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequality for nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <title>On the deterministic interior body of random polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of independent copies of a random vector $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We revisit the question to determine the asymptotic shape of the random polytope $K_N={\rm conv}\{X_1,\ldots ,X_N\}$ where $N&gt;n$. We show that for any $\beta\in (0,1)$ there exists a constant $c(\beta)&gt;0$ such that the following holds true: If $\mu $ is a Borel probability measure on ${\mathbb R}^n$ then, for all $N\geq c(\beta)n$ we have that $K_N\supseteq T_{\beta\ln(\frac{N}{n})}(\mu)$ with probability greater than $1-\exp(-\tfrac{1}{2}N^{1-\beta}n^{\beta})$, where $T_p(\mu)$ is the convex set of all points $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with half-space depth greater than or equal to $e^{-p}$. Our approach does not require any additional assumptions about the measure $\mu$ and hence it generalizes and/or improves a sequence of previous results. Moreover, for the class of strongly regular measures we compare the family $\{T_p(\mu)\}_{p&gt;0}$ to other natural families of convex bodies associated with $\mu$, such as the $L_p$-centroid bodies of $\mu$ or the level sets of the Cram\'{e}r transform of $\mu$, and use this information in order to estimate the size of a random $K_N$.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of the Largest Eigenvalue of a Kernel Matrix with application in Graphon-based Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the spectral properties of general random kernel matrices $[K(U_i,U_j)]_{1\leq i\neq j\leq n}$ from a Lipschitz kernel $K$ with $n$ independent random variables $U_1,U_2,\ldots, U_n$ distributed uniformly over $[0,1]$. In particular we identify a dichotomy in the extreme eigenvalue of the kernel matrix, where, if the kernel $K$ is degenerate, the largest eigenvalue of the kernel matrix (after proper normalization) converges weakly to a weighted sum of independent chi-squared random variables. In contrast, for non-degenerate kernels, it converges to a normal distribution extending and reinforcing earlier results from Koltchinskii and Gin\'e (2000). Further, we apply this result to show a dichotomy in the asymptotic behavior of extreme eigenvalues of $W$-random graphs, which are pivotal in modeling complex networks and analyzing large-scale graph behavior. These graphs are generated using a kernel $W$, termed as graphon, by connecting vertices $i$ and $j$ with probability $W(U_i, U_j)$. Our results show that for a Lipschitz graphon $W$, if the degree function is constant, the fluctuation of the largest eigenvalue (after proper normalization) converges to the weighted sum of independent chi-squared random variables and an independent normal distribution. Otherwise, it converges to a normal distribution.</description>

Abstract: We show that any non-linear heat equation with scaling critical dimension $-1$ is locally well-posed when its initial condition is taken as the Gaussian free field in fractional dimension $d &lt; 4$. Our results in particular extend the well-posedness results of arXiv:2111.10652, arXiv:2201.03487 from $d=3$ to the entire subcritical regime.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of the viscous scalar conservation laws with a degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the ergodicity in $H^\nn,\nn=\lfloor\frac{d}{2}+1\rfloor$ of the viscous scalar conservation laws on torus $\mT^d$ with general polynomial flux and a degenerate noise. The noise could appear in as few as several directions. We introduce a localized framework that restricts attention to trajectories with controlled energy growth, circumventing the limitations of traditional contraction-based approaches. This localized method allows for a demonstration of e-property and consequently proves the uniqueness of invariant measure under a H{\"o}rmander-type condition. Furthermore, we characterize the absolute continuity of the invariant measure's projections onto any finite-dimensional subspaces under requirement on a new algebraically non-degenerate condition for the flux.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Multidimensional Long-Range Random Field Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14150v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in a class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting, proposed by two of us, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fr\"ohlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha &gt; d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative approach that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen suggested that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of continuous stochastic volatility models, discussing their historical development and the key stylized facts that have driven the field. Special attention is dedicated to fractional and rough methods: we outline the motivation behind them and characterize some landmark models. In addition, we briefly touch the problem of VIX modeling and recent advances in the SPX-VIX joint calibration puzzle.</description>

      <title>Multi-period static hedging of European options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the hedging of European options when the price of the underlying asset follows a single-factor Markovian framework. By working in such a setting, Carr and Wu \cite{carr2014static} derived a spanning relation between a given option and a continuum of shorter-term options written on the same asset. In this paper, we have extended their approach to simultaneously include options over multiple short maturities. We then show a practical implementation of this with a finite set of shorter-term options to determine the hedging error using a Gaussian Quadrature method. We perform a wide range of experiments for both the \textit{Black-Scholes} and \textit{Merton Jump Diffusion} models, illustrating the comparative performance of the two methods.</description>

      <title>Mirror Descent for Stochastic Control Problems with Measure-valued Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the convergence of the mirror descent algorithm for finite horizon stochastic control problems with measure-valued control processes. The control objective involves a convex regularisation function, denoted as $h$, with regularisation strength determined by the weight $\tau\ge 0$. The setting covers regularised relaxed control problems. Under suitable conditions, we establish the relative smoothness and convexity of the control objective with respect to the Bregman divergence of $h$, and prove linear convergence of the algorithm for $\tau=0$ and exponential convergence for $\tau&gt;0$. The results apply to common regularisers including relative entropy, $\chi^2$-divergence, and entropic Wasserstein costs. This validates recent reinforcement learning heuristics that adding regularisation accelerates the convergence of gradient methods. The proof exploits careful regularity estimates of backward stochastic differential equations in the bounded mean oscillation norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the notion of random Dehn function and compute an asymptotic upper bound for finitely presented acylindrically hyperbolic groups whose Dehn function is at most polynomial. By showing that in these cases, if the group is not hyperbolic, then the random Dehn function is strictly smaller than the usual Dehn function we confirm Gromov's intuition albeit in a different model. In fact, we show that in these cases the random Dehn function is at most quadratic.</description>

      <title>Source identification via pathwise gradient estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of PDE-constrained optimization theory, source identification problems traditionally entail particles emerging from an unknown source distribution inside a domain, moving according to a prescribed stochastic process, e.g.~Brownian motion, and then exiting through the boundary of a compact domain. Given information about the flux of particles through the boundary of the domain, the challenge is to infer as much as possible about the source.
  In the PDE setting, it is usually assumed that the flux can be observed without error and at all points on the boundary. Here we consider a different, more statistical presentation of the problem, in which the data has the form of discrete counts of particles arriving at a set of disjoint detectors whose union is a strict subset of the boundary. In keeping with the primacy of the stochastic processes in the generation of the model, we present a stochastic gradient descent algorithm in which exit rates and parameter sensitivities are computed by simulations of particle paths. We present examples for both It\^o diffusion and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes, noting that the form of the sensitivities depends only on the parameterization of the source distribution and is universal among a large class of Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Langevin Diffusions with Density-dependent Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of non-convex optimization, we let the temperature of a Langevin diffusion to depend on the diffusion's own density function. The rationale is that the induced density captures to some extent the landscape imposed by the non-convex function to be minimized, such that a density-dependent temperature provides location-wise random perturbation that may better react to, for instance, the location and depth of local minimizers. As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density, it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding (nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by Trevisan's superposition principle. As time goes to infinity, we further show that the induced density converges to an invariant distribution, which admits an explicit formula in terms of the Lambert $W$ function. A numerical example suggests that the density-dependent temperature can simultaneously improve the accuracy of and rate of convergence to the estimate of global minimizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the divergence of Kleinian groups $\Gamma$ and the recurrence of simple random walks on the Schreier graph associated with $\Gamma$. In particular, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of a lattice and is of divergence type, then the Schreier graph is recurrent. Our approach builds connections among the growth rate of the $\Gamma$-orbit, the volume growth rate of the quotient manifolds, and the growth rate of the Schreier graph. Using the connections, we construct abundant Kleinian groups of divergence type.</description>
