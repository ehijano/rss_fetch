      <title>Wider systems for linear logic with fixed points: proof theory and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate infinitary wellfounded systems for linear logic with fixed points, with transfinite branching rules indexed by some closure ordinal $\alpha$ for fixed points. Our main result is that provability in the system for some computable ordinal $\alpha$ is complete for the $\omega^{\alpha^\omega}$ level of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy.
  To this end we first develop proof theoretic foundations, namely cut elimination and focussing results, to control both the upper and lower bound analysis. Our arguments employ a carefully calibrated notion of formula rank, calculating a tight bound on the height of the (cut-free) proof search space.</description>

      <title>On Sets That Encode Themselves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given partial information about a set, we are interested in fully recovering the original set from what is given. If a set encodes itself robustly, any partial information about the set suffices to fully recover the information about the original set. Jockusch defined a set $A$ to be introenumerable if each infinite subset of $A$ can enumerate $A$, and this is an example of a set which encodes itself. There are several other notions capturing self-encoding differently. We say $A$ is uniformly introenumerable if each infinite subset of $A$ can uniformly enumerate $A$, whereas $A$ is introreducible if each infinite subset of $A$ can compute $A$. We investigate properties of various notions of self-encoding and prove new results on their interactions. Greenberg, Harrison-Trainor, Patey, and Turetsky showed that we can always find some uniformity from an introenumerable set. We show that this can be reversed: we can construct an introenumerable set by patching up uniformity. This gives a rise to a new method of constructing a nontrivial introenumerable or introreducible set.</description>

      <title>Generalized Decidability via Brouwer Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the setting of constructive mathematics, we suggest and study a framework for decidability of properties, which allows for finer distinctions than just "decidable, semidecidable, or undecidable". We work in homotopy type theory and use Brouwer ordinals to specify the level of decidability of a property. In this framework, we express the property that a proposition is $\alpha$-decidable, for a Brouwer ordinal $\alpha$, and show that it generalizes decidability and semidecidability. Further generalizing known results, we show that $\alpha$-decidable propositions are closed under binary conjunction, and discuss for which $\alpha$ they are closed under binary disjunction. We prove that if each $P(i)$ is semidecidable, then the countable meet $\forall i\in \mathbb N. P(i)$ is $\omega^2$-decidable, and similar results for countable joins and iterated quantifiers. We also discuss the relationship with countable choice. All our results are formalized in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Flexible constraint satisfiability and a problem in semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.03127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine some flexible notions of constraint satisfaction, observing some relationships between model theoretic notions of universal Horn class membership and robust satisfiability. We show the \texttt{NP}-completeness of $2$-robust monotone 1-in-3 3SAT in order to give very small examples of finite algebras with \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. In particular we give a $3$-element algebra with this property, and solve a widely stated problem by showing that the $6$-element Brandt monoid has \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. These are the smallest possible sizes for a general algebra and a semigroup to exhibit \texttt{NP}-hardness for the membership problem of finite algebras in finitely generated varieties.</description>

      <title>Finite model theory for pseudovarieties and universal algebra: preservation, definability and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02653v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore new interactions between finite model theory and classical streams of universal algebra and semigroup theory. A key result is an example of finite algebras whose variety is not finitely axiomatisable in first order logic, but where the class of finite members are finitely axiomatisable amongst finite algebras. These algebras present a negative solution to a first order formulation of the Eilenberg-Sch\"utzenberger problem, and witness the simultaneous failure of the {\L}os-Tarski Theorem, the SP-Preservation Theorem and Birkhoff's HSP-Preservation Theorem at the finite level. The examples also show that a pseudovariety without any finite pseudoequational basis may be finitely axiomatisable in first order logic amongst finite algebras. Other results include the undecidability of deciding first order definability of the pseudovariety of a finite algebra, and a mapping from any fixed finite template constraint satisfaction problem to a first order equivalent variety membership problem.</description>

      <title>The most natural paradefinite logic relative to classical logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A paradefinite logic is a logic that can serve as the underlying logic for theories that are inconsistent or incomplete. A well-known paradefinite logic is Belnap-Dunn logic. Various expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic have been studied in the literature. In this note, it is argued that the most natural paradefinite logic relative to classical logic is the expansion of Belnap-Dunn logic with a falsity connective and an implication connective for which the standard deduction theorem holds.</description>

      <title>A motivic Fundamental Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove motivic versions of the Langlands-Shelstad Fundamental Lemma and Ng\^o's Geometric Stabilization. To achieve this, we follow the strategy from the recent proof by Groechenig, Wyss and Ziegler which avoided the use of perverse sheaves using instead $p$-adic integration and Tate duality. We make a key use of a construction of Denef and Loeser which assigns a virtual motive to any definable set in the theory of pseudo-finite fields.</description>
