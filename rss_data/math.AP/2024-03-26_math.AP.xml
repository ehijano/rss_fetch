      <title>Conditional integrability and stability for the homogeneous Boltzmann equation with very soft potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a practical criterion that justifies the propagation and appearance of $L^{p}$-norms for the solutions to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with very soft potentials without cutoff. Such criterion also provides a new conditional stability result for classical solutions to the equation. All results are quantitative. Our approach is inspired by a recent analogous result for the Landau equation derived in arXiv:2306.15729 and generalises existing conditional results related to higher integrability properties and stability of solutions to the Boltzmann equation with very soft potentials.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability for the Superposition of Viscous Contact Wave and Rarefaction Waves to Non-isentropic Compressible Navier-Stokes System with General Initial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the large time behavior of the solutions for the Cauchy problem to the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes system with the motion of a viscous heat-conducting perfect polytropic gas is investigated.Our result shows that the combination of a viscous contact wave with rarefaction waves is asymptotically stable, when the large initial disturbance of the density, velocity and temperature belong to $H^{1}(\mathbb{R})$, $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})\cap L^{4}(\mathbb{R})$ and $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$, provided the strength of the combination waves is suitably small. In addition, the initial disturbance on the derivation of velocity and temperature belong to $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$ can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Geometric series solution for the plane elastostatic problem in the presence of a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytic series solution method for the elastic inclusion problem in a two-dimensional unbounded isotropic medium with a cavity. Generalizing the work of Mattei and Lim \cite{Mattei:2021:EAS}, this study develops an analytic series solution method for the elastic inclusion problem to encompass a cavity problem. The central mathematical challenge tackled in this research is to deal with the conormal derivative condition. By using the complex-variable formulation for the conormal derivative, we effectively deal with the boundary condition and derive an explicit series solution for the plane elastostatic problem with a cavity of arbitrary shape subject to arbitrary far-field loading. The solution is expressed as a series expansion in terms of the given far-field loading and the exterior conformal mapping associated with the cavity.</description>

      <title>Analytic asymptotic formulas for effective parameters of planar elastic composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effective elastic properties of periodic dilute two-phase composites consisting of an homogeneous isotropic matrix and a periodic array of rigid inclusions. We assume the rigid inclusion in a unit cell is a simply connected, bounded domain so that there exists an exterior conformal mapping corresponding the inclusion. Recently, an analytical series solution method for the elastic problem with a rigid inclusion was developed based on the layer potential technique and the geometric function theory \cite{Mattei:2021:EAS}. In this paper, by using the series solution method, we derive expression formulas for the elastic moment tensors--the coefficients of the multipole expansion associated with an elastic inclusion--of an inclusion of arbitrary shape. These formulas for the elastic moment tensors lead us to analytic asymptotic formulas for the effective parameters of the periodic elastic composites with rigid inclusions in terms of the associated exterior conformal mapping.</description>

      <title>On a dryout point for a stationary incompressible thermal fluid with phase transition in a pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dryout point is recognized as the position where the phase transition from liquid to vapor occurs. In the one-dimensional case, by solving the stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations with phase transition, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a dryout point to exist when the temperature at the liquid-vapor interface is given. In addition, we show by considering thermodynamics that the temperature at the dryout point and the density of the vapor phase can be determined by given density and sufficiently small injected mass flux of the liquid phase.</description>

      <title>On quasi-linear reaction diffusion systems arising from compartmental SEIR models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global existence and boundedness of solutions to quasi-linear reaction-diffusion systems are investigated. The system arises from compartmental models describing the spread of infectious diseases proposed in [Viguerie et al, Appl. Math. Lett. (2021); Viguerie et al, Comput. Mech. (2020)], where the diffusion rate is assumed to depend on the total population, leading to quasilinear diffusion with possible degeneracy. The mathematical analysis of this model has been addressed recently in [Auricchio et al, Math. Method Appl. Sci. (2023] where it was essentially assumed that all sub-populations diffuse at the same rate, which yields a positive lower bound of the total population, thus removing the degeneracy. In this work, we remove this assumption completely and show the global existence and boundedness of solutions by exploiting a recently developed $L^p$-energy method. Our approach is applicable to a larger class of systems and is sufficiently robust to allow model variants and different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of solutions for the logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a potential on lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and multiplicity of solutions for the logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^N$ $$ -\Delta u+V(x) u=u \log u^2, \quad x \in \mathbb{Z}^N, $$ When the potential $V$ is coercive, we obtain infinitely many solutions by adapting some arguments of the Fountain theorem. In the cases of periodic potential, asymptotically periodic potential and bounded potential, we first investigate the existence of ground state solutions via the variation methods, and then we generalize these results from $\mathbb{Z}^N$ to quasi-transitive graphs. Finally, we extend the main results of the paper to the $p$-Laplacian equation with the logarithmic nonlinearity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finer properties related to the interior regularity of $m$-dimensional area minimizing currents mod$(q)$ in arbitrary codimension. We show that the set of points where at least one tangent cone is translation invariant along $m-1$ directions is locally a connected $C^{1,\beta}$ submanifold, and moreover such points have unique tangent cones. We establish these results as consequences of a fine excess decay theorem.</description>

      <title>Existence for turbulent flows through permeable media with unbounded turbulent-depending coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model that governs turbulent flows through permeable media is considered in this work. The model under consideration is based on a double-averaging concept which in turn is described by the time-averaging technique characteristic of the turbulence k-epsilon model and by the volume-averaging methodology that is used to model unstable flows through porous media. The functions of turbulence viscosity, turbulence diffusion and turbulence production are assumed to be unbounded with respect to the turbulent kinetic energy. For the associated initial-and boundary-value problem, we prove the existence of suitable weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of nonconvex viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations in stationary ergodic media in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish homogenization for nondegenerate viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations in one space dimension when the diffusion coefficient $a(x,\omega) &gt; 0$ and the Hamiltonian $H(p,x,\omega)$ are general stationary ergodic processes in $x$. Our result is valid under mild regularity assumptions on $a$ and $H$ plus standard coercivity and growth assumptions (in $p$) on the latter. In particular, we impose neither any additional condition on the law of the media nor any shape restriction on the graph of $p\mapsto H(p,x,\omega)$. Our approach consists of two main steps: (i) constructing a suitable candidate $\overline{H}$ for the effective Hamiltonian; (ii) proving homogenization. In the first step, we work with the set $E$ of all points at which $\overline{H}$ is naturally determined by correctors with stationary derivatives. We prove that $E$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is unbounded from above and below, and, if $E\neq\mathbb{R}$, then $\overline{H}$ can be extended continuously to $\mathbb{R}$ by setting it to be constant on each connected component of $E^c$. In the second step, we use a key bridging lemma, comparison arguments and several general results to verify that homogenization holds with this $\overline{H}$ as the effective Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Local time decay for fractional Schr\"odinger operators with slowly decaying potentials and a weaker Agmon type estimate in a classically forbidden region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A local time decay estimate of fractional Schr\"odinger operators with slowly decaying positive potentials are studied. It is shown that its resolvent is smooth near zero and the time propagator has fast local time decay which is very different from very short-range cases. The key element of the proof is to establish a weaker Agmon estimate for a classically forbidden region using exotic symbol calculus. As a byproduct, we prove that the Riesz operator is a pseudodifferential operator with an exotic symbol.</description>

      <title>A poroelastic plate model obtained by simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the starting point of our analysis is coupled system of elasticity and Stokes equation. We consider two small parameters: the thickness $h$ of the thin plate and the pore scale $\varepsilon(h)$ which depend on $h$. We will focus specifically on the case when the pore size is small relative to the thickness of the plate. The main goal here is derive a model for a poroelastic plate from the $3D$ problem as $h$ goes to zero using simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction techniques. The obtained model generalizes the poroelastic plate model derived by A. Mikeli\'c et. al. in 2015 by dimension reduction techniques from $3D$ Biot's equations in the sense that it also covers the case of contact of poroelastic and elastic plate as well as the evolution equation with inertia term.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ restriction bounds for Neumann data on surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{u_\lambda\}$ be a sequence of $L^2$-normalized Laplacian eigenfunctions on a compact two-dimensional smooth Riemanniann manifold $(M,g)$. We seek to get an $L^p$ restriction bounds of the Neumann data $ \lambda^{-1} \partial_\nu u_{\lambda}\,\vline_\gamma$ along a unit geodesic $\gamma$. Using the $T$-$T^*$ argument one can transfer the problem to an estimate of the norm of a Fourier integral operator and show that such bound is $O(\lambda^{-\frac{1}p+\frac{3}2})$. The Van De Corput theorem (Lemma 2.1) plays the crucial role in our proof. Moreover, this upper bound is shown to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Linearised Calder\'on problem: Reconstruction of unbounded perturbations in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently an algorithm was given in [Garde &amp; Hyv\"onen, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 2024] for exact direct reconstruction of any $L^2$ perturbation from linearised data in the two-dimensional linearised Calder\'on problem. It was a simple forward substitution method based on a 2D Zernike basis. We now consider the three-dimensional linearised Calder\'on problem in a ball, and use a 3D Zernike basis to obtain a method for exact direct reconstruction of any $L^3$ perturbation from linearised data. The method is likewise a forward substitution, hence making it very efficient to numerically implement. Moreover, the 3D method only makes use of a relatively small subset of boundary measurements for exact reconstruction, compared to a full $L^2$ basis of current densities.</description>

      <title>Singular profile of free boundary of incompressible inviscid fluid with external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to investigate the singular profile of the free boundary of two-dimensional incompressible inviscid fluid with external force near the stagnation point. More precisely, given an external force with some polynomial type decay close to the stagnation point, the singular profile of the free boundary at stagnation point possible are corner wave, flat and cusp singularity. Through excluding the cusp and flat singularity, we know the only singular profile is corner wave singularity, and the corner depends on the decay rate of the solution near the stagnation point. The analysis depends on the geometric method to a class of Bernoulli-type free boundary problem with given degenerate gradient function on free boundary. This work is motivated by the significant work [E. V$\breve{a}$rv$\breve{a}$ruc$\breve{a}$ and G. Weiss, Acta Math, 206, 363-403, (2011)] on Stokes conjecture to the incompressible inviscid fluid acted on by gravity.</description>

      <title>Stable solution and extremal solution for the fractional $p$-Laplacian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to consider the stable solution and extremal solution for the fractional $p$-Laplacian equation: $(-\Delta)_p^s u= \lambda f(u),\; u&gt; 0 ~\text{in}~\Omega;\; u=0\;\text{in}~ \mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega$, where $p&gt;1$, $s\in (0,1)$, $N&gt;sp$, $\lambda&gt;0$ and $\Omega$ is a bounded domain with continuous boundary. We first construct the notion of stable solution, and then we prove that when $f$ is of class $C^1$, nondecreasing and such that $f(0)&gt;0$ and $\underset{t\to \infty}{\lim}\frac{f(t)}{t^{p-1}}=\infty$, there exists an extremal parameter $\lambda^*\in (0, \infty)$ such that a bounded minimal solution $u_\lambda$ exists if $\lambda\in (0, \lambda^*)$, and no bounded solution exists if $\lambda&gt;\lambda^*$, no $W_0^{s,p}(\Omega)$ solution exists if in addition $f(t)^{\frac{1}{p-1}}$ is convex. Moreover, this family of minimal solutions are stable, and nondecreasing in $\lambda$, therefore the extremal function $u^*:=\underset{\lambda\to\lambda^*}{\lim}u_\lambda$ exists.
  For the regularity of the extremal function, we first show the $L^r$-estimates for the equation $(-\Delta)_p^su=g$ with $g\in W_0^{s, p}(\Omega)^*\cap L^q(\Omega)$, $q\ge 1$. When $f$ is a power-like nonlinearity, we derive the $W_0^{s,p}(\Omega)$ regularity of $u^*$ in all dimension and $L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ regularity of $u^*$ in some low dimensions. For more general nonlinearities, when $f$ is class of $C^2$ and such that some convexity assumptions, then $u^*\in W_0^{s,p}(\Omega)$ if $N&lt;sp(1+\frac{p}{p-1})$ and $u^*\in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ if $N&lt;\frac{sp^2}{p-1}$. Furthermore, when the limit $\tau=\underset{t\to\infty}{\lim}\frac{f(t)f''(t)}{f'(t)^2}$ exists and $\tau&gt;\frac{p-2}{p-1}$, the results above can be improved as: $u^*\in W_0^{s,p}(\Omega)$ for all dimensions, and $u^*\in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ if $N&lt;sp+\frac{4sp}{p-1}$.</description>

Abstract: We classify the smooth linearly stable self-similar solutions of the semilinear heat equation $u_t=\Delta u+|u|^{p-1}u$ in $\mathbb{R}^n\times (0,T)$ under an integral condition for all $p&gt;1$. As a corollary, we prove that finite time blowing up solutions of this equation on a bounded convex domain with $u(\cdot,0)\geq 0$ and $u_t(\cdot,0)\geq 0$ converges to a constant after rescaling at the blow-up point for all $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Self-duel solution of 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations will have a global smooth solution for all smooth, finite energy initial data is a Millennium Prize problem. One of the main difficulties of this problem is that the Navier-Stokes equations are actually a system of semilinear heat equations rather than a single equation. In this paper, we discover a remarkable hidden symmetry of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Under this symmetric reduction, the system reduces to a single scalar semilinear heat equation. The symmetry also holds for the 3D incompressible Euler equations.</description>

      <title>On the Korteweg-de Vries limit for the Boussinesq equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is known as a universal equation describing various long waves in dispersive systems. In this article, we prove that in a certain scaling regime, a large class of rough solutions to the Boussinesq equation are approximated by the sums of two counter-propagating waves solving the KdV equations. It extends the earlier result by \cite{Schneider1998} to slightly more regular than $L^2$-solutions. Our proof is based on robust Fourier analysis methods developed for the low regularity theory of nonlinear dispersive equations.</description>

      <title>Interior Schauder estimates for fractional elliptic equations in nondivergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain sharp interior Schauder estimates for solutions to nonlocal Poisson problems driven by fractional powers of nondivergence form elliptic operators $(-a^{ij}(x) \partial_{ij})^s$, for $0&lt;s&lt;1$, in bounded domains under minimal regularity assumptions on the coefficients $a^{ij}(x)$. Solutions to the fractional problem are characterized by a local degenerate/singular extension problem. We introduce a novel notion of viscosity solutions for the extension problem and implement Caffarelli's perturbation methodology in the corresponding degenerate/singular Monge--Amp\`ere geometry to prove Schauder estimates in the extension. This in turn implies interior Schauder estimates for solutions to the fractional nonlocal equation. Furthermore, we prove a new Hopf lemma, the interior Harnack inequality and H\"older regularity in the Monge--Amp\`ere geometry for viscosity solutions to the extension problem.</description>

Abstract: We establish a concavity principle for solutions to elliptic and parabolic equations on complex projective space, generalizing the results of Langford and Scheuer. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a general concavity principle outside the constant sectional curvature regime, and in particular, our result partially answers a question raised by Korevaar in 1985 regarding the concavity of solutions to elliptic equations on manifolds with non-constant sectional curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study weak Harnack inequality and a priori H\"older regularity of harmonic functions for symmetric nonlocal Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces. Our analysis relies on three main assumptions: the existence of a strongly local Dirichlet form with sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates, a tail estimate of the jump measure outside balls and a local energy comparability condition. We establish the robustness of our results, ensuring that the constants in our estimates remain bounded, provided that the order of the scale function appearing in the tail estimate and local energy comparability condition, maintains a certain distance from zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the stochastic Abelian-Higgs equations in two dimensions. The proof is based on a new covariant approach, which consists of two parts: First, we introduce covariant stochastic objects. The covariant stochastic objects and their multi-linear interactions are controlled using covariant heat kernel estimates. Second, we control nonlinear remainders using a covariant monotonicity formula, which is inspired by earlier work of Hamilton.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a normalized solution $u=(u_1,\ldots,u_K)$ to the system of $K$ coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations \begin{equation*}
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  -\Delta u_i+ \lambda_i u_i = \sum_{j=1}^K\beta_{i,j}u_i|u_i|^{p/2-2}|u_j|^{p/2} \quad \mathrm{in} \, \mathbb{R}^3,\newline
  u_i \in H^1_{rad}(\mathbb{R}^3),\newline
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |u_i|^2 \, dx = \rho_i^2 \quad \text{for }i=1,\ldots, K,
  \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\rho=(\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_K)\in(0,\infty)^K$ is prescribed, $(\lambda,u) \in \mathbb{R}^K\times H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)^K$ are the unknown and $4\leq p&lt;6$. In the case of two equations we show the existence of multiple solutions provided that the coupling is sufficiently large. We also show that for negative coupling there are no ground state solutions. The main novelty in our approach is that we use the Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum theorem in order to estimate the Morse index of a solution as well as a Liouville-type result in an exterior domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional integral representations for solutions of the motion equations for wall-bounded incompressible viscous flows, expressed (implicitly) in terms of distributions of solutions to stochastic differential equations of McKean-Vlasov type, are established by using a perturbation technique. These representations are used to obtain exact random vortex dynamics for wall-bounded viscous flows. Numerical schemes therefore are proposed and the convergence of the numerical schemes for random vortex dynamics with an additional force term is established. Several numerical experiments are carried out for demonstrating the motion of a viscous flow within a thin layer next to the fluid boundary.</description>

      <title>Fourier Galerkin approximation of mean field control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to provide a finite dimensional approximation of the solution to a mean field optimal control problem set on the $d$-dimensional torus. The approximation is obtained by means of a Fourier-Galerkin method, the main principle of which is to convolve probability measures on the torus by the Dirichlet kernel or, equivalently, to truncate the Fourier expansion of probability measures on the torus. However, this operation has the main feature not to leave the space of probability measures invariant, which drawback is know as \textit{Gibbs}' phenomenon. In spite of this, we manage to prove that, for initial conditions in the `interior' of the space of probability measures and for sufficiently large levels of truncation, the Fourier-Galerkin method induces a new finite dimensional control problem whose trajectories take values in the space of probability measures with a finite number of Fourier coefficients. Our main result asserts that, whenever the cost functionals are smooth and convex, the distance between the optimal trajectories of the original and approximating control problems decreases at a polynomial rate as the index of truncation in the Fourier-Galerkin method tends to $\infty$. A similar result holds for the distance between the corresponding value functions. From a practical point of view, our approach provides an efficient strategy to approximate mean field control optimizers by finite dimensional parameters and opens new perspectives for the numerical analysis of mean field control problems. It may be also applied to discretize more general mean field game systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we rewrite the time-dependent Bogoliubov$\unicode{x2013}$de Gennes equation in an appropriate semiclassical form and establish its semiclassical limit to a two-particle kinetic transport equation with an effective mean-field background potential satisfying the one-particle Vlasov equation. Moreover, for some semiclassical regimes, we obtain a higher-order correction to the two-particle kinetic transport equation, capturing a nontrivial two-body interaction effect. The convergence is proven for $C^2$ interaction potentials in terms of a semiclassical optimal transport pseudo-metric. Furthermore, combining our current results with the results of Marcantoni et al. [arXiv:2310.15280], we establish a joint semiclassical and mean-field approximation of the dynamics of a system of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Fermions by the Vlasov equation in some negative order Sobolev topology.</description>

      <title>Convection-Enabled Boundary Control of a 2D Channel Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional channel. The tangential and normal velocities are assumed to be periodic in the streamwise (horizontal) direction. Moreover, we consider no-slip boundary conditions on the tangential velocity at the top and bottom walls of the channel, and normal velocity actuation at the top and bottom walls. For an arbitrarily large Reynolds number, we design the boundary control inputs to achieve global exponential stabilization, in the L2 sense, of a chosen parabolic Poiseuille profile. Moreover, we design the control inputs such that they have zero mean, but non-zero cubic mean. The zero-mean property is to ensure that the conservation of mass constraint is verified. The non-zero cubic mean property is the key to exploiting the stabilizing effect of nonlinear convection and achieving global stabilization independently of the size of the Reynolds number. This paper is not only the first work where a closed-form feedback law is proposed for global stabilization of parabolic Poiseuille profiles for arbitrary Reynolds number but is also the first generalization of the Cardano-Lyapunov formula, designed initially to stabilize scalar-valued convective PDEs, to a vector-valued convective PDE with a divergence-free constraint on the state.</description>

      <title>Positive mass and isoperimetry for continuous metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the positive mass theorem and the existence of isoperimetric sets on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense.
  We prove that if the manifold has an end that is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat, and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, then Huisken's isoperimetric mass is nonnegative. This addresses a version of a recent conjecture of Huisken about positive isoperimetric mass theorems for continuous metrics satisfying $R_g\geq 0$ in a weak sense. As a consequence, any fill-in of a truncation of a Schwarzschild space with negative ADM mass has nonnegative isoperimetric mass.
  Moreover, in case the whole manifold is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, we prove that, as a large scale effect, isoperimetric sets with arbitrarily large volume exist.</description>

      <title>Initial data sets with vanishing mass are contained in pp-wave spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1981, Schoen-Yau and Witten showed that in General Relativity both the total energy $E$ and the total mass $m$ of an initial data set modelling an isolated gravitational system are non-negative. Moreover, if $E=0$, the initial data set must be contained in Minkowski space. In this paper, we show that if $m=0$, i.e. if $E$ equals the total momentum $|P|$, the initial data set must be contained in a pp-wave spacetime. Our proof combines spinorial methods with spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions. Additionally, we find the decay rate threshold where the embedding has to be within Minkowski space and construct non-vacuum initial data sets with $m=0$ in the borderline case. As a consequence, this completely settles the rigidity of the spacetime positive mass theorem for spin manifolds.</description>

      <title>A unified kinematic wave theory for melt infiltration into firn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the refreezing of melt water in firn we revisit the one-dimensional percolation of liquid water and non-reactive gas in porous ice. We analyze the dynamics of infiltration in the absence of capillary forces and heat conduction to understand the coupling between advective heat and mass transport in firn. In this limit, we formulate a kinematic wave theory that results in a 2X2-system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) corresponding to the conservation of composition and enthalpy. For simple initial conditions (Riemann problems) this system admits self-similar solutions that illuminate the structure of melting/refreezing fronts and analytical solutions are provided for 12 basic cases of physical relevance encountered in the literature. Further we develop an extended kinematic theory that encompasses the cases when the firn saturates completely to form a perched water table governed by elliptic PDE so that the model is no longer fully hyperbolic (local). These solutions provide benchmarks for numerical models of melt infiltration into firn. They also provide insight into important physical processes such as the formation of frozen fringes, the perching of meltwater on pre-existing low porosity layers and the conditions required for impermeable ice lens formation. Lastly, these analytic solutions can be utilized to improve and compare the performance of the firn hydrology, ice-sheet and Earth system models. Our analysis provides a theoretical framework to understand these important processes in firn which affect the partitioning between meltwater infiltration and surface runoff and therefore determine the surface mass loss from ice sheets and its contribution to sea level rise.</description>

      <title>Blow Up of Compact Mean Curvature Flow Solutions with Bounded Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1994, Vel\'{a}zquez constructed a countable family of complete hypersurfaces flowing in $\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ $(N\geq 4)$ by mean curvature, each of which develops a type II singularity at the origin in finite time. Later Guo and Sesum showed that for a non-empty subset of Vel\'{a}zquez's solutions, the mean curvature blows up near the origin, at a rate smaller than that of the second fundamental form; recently Stolarski proved another subset of these solutions has bounded mean curvature up to the singular time. In this paper, we follow their arguments to construct compact mean curvature flow solutions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ $(n\geq 8)$ with bounded mean curvature.</description>

      <title>The cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with rough potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a spatially rough potential, a key equation in the mathematical setup for nonlinear Anderson localization. Our study comprises two main parts: new optimal results on the well-posedness analysis on the PDE level, and subsequently a new efficient numerical method, its convergence analysis and simulations that illustrate our analytical results. In the analysis part, our results focus on understanding how the regularity of the solution is influenced by the regularity of the potential, where we provide quantitative and explicit characterizations. Ill-posedness results are also established to demonstrate the sharpness of the obtained regularity characterizations and to indicate the minimum regularity required from the potential for the NLS to be solvable. Building upon the obtained regularity results, we design an appropriate numerical discretization for the model and establish its convergence with an optimal error bound. The numerical experiments in the end not only verify the theoretical regularity results, but also confirm the established convergence rate of the proposed scheme. Additionally, a comparison with other existing schemes is conducted to demonstrate the better accuracy of our new scheme in the case of a rough potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.04435v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Gel'fand's inverse problem, one aims to determine the topology, differential structure and Riemannian metric of a compact manifold $M$ with boundary from the knowledge of the boundary $\partial M,$ the Neumann eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ and the boundary values of the eigenfunctions $\varphi_j|_{\partial M}$. We show that this problem has a stable solution with quantitative stability estimates in a class of manifolds with bounded geometry. More precisely, we show that finitely many eigenvalues and the boundary values of corresponding eigenfunctions, known up to small errors, determine a metric space that is close to the manifold in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We provide an algorithm to construct this metric space. This result is based on an explicit estimate on the stability of the unique continuation for the wave operator.</description>

      <title>Zero-viscosity Limit for Boussinesq Equations with Vertical Viscosity and Navier Boundary in the Half Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the zero-viscosity limit of $2$-D Boussinesq equations with vertical viscosity and zero diffusivity, which is a nonlinear system with partial dissipation arising in atmospheric sciences and oceanic circulation. The domain is taken as $\mathbb{R}_+^2$ with Navier-type boundary. We prove the nonlinear stability of the approximate solution constructed by boundary layer expansion in conormal Sobolev space. The expansion order and convergence rates for the inviscid limit are also identified in this paper. Our paper extends a partial zero-dissipation limit results of Boussinesq system with full dissipation by Chae D. $[Adv. Math. 203, no. 2, 2006]$ in the whole space to the case with partial dissipation and Navier boundary in the half plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the development and analysis of a mathematical model that is motivated by interstitial hydrodynamics and tissue deformation mechanics (poro-elasto-hydrodynamics) within an in-vitro solid tumor. The classical mixture theory is adopted for mass and momentum balance equations for a two-phase system. A main contribution of this study, we treat the physiological transport parameter (i.e., hydraulic resistivity) as anisotropic and heterogeneous, thus the governing system is strongly coupled and nonlinear. We derived a weak formulation and then formulated the equivalent fixed-point problem. This enabled us to use the Galerkin method, and the classical results on monotone operators combined with the well-known Schauder and Banach fixed point theorems to prove the existence and uniqueness results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the nodal set of solutions to an unstable Alt-Phillips type problem \[ -\Delta u = \lambda_+(u^+)^{p-1}-\lambda_-(u^-)^{q-1} \] where $1 \le p&lt;q&lt;2$, $\lambda_+ &gt;0$, $\lambda_- \ge 0$. The equation is characterized by the sublinear inhomogeneous character of the right hand-side, which makes difficult to adapt in a standard way classical tools from free-boundary problems, such as monotonicity formulas and blow-up arguments. Our main results are: the local behavior of solutions close to the nodal set; the complete classification of the admissible vanishing orders, and estimates on the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set, for local minimizers; the existence of degenerate (not locally minimal) solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a spectral inequality (a specific type of uncertainty relation) for Schr\"odinger operators with confinement potentials, in particular of Shubin-type. The sensor sets are allowed to decay exponentially, where the precise allowed decay rate depends on the potential. The proof uses an interpolation inequality derived by Carleman estimates, quantitative weighted $L^2$-estimates and an $H^1$-concentration estimate, all of them for functions in a spectral subspace of the operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12068v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the uniqueness of ground states to the following fractional nonlinear elliptic equation with harmonic potential, $$ (-\Delta)^s u+ \left(\omega+|x|^2\right) u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in}\,\, \R^n, $$ where $n \geq 1$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $\omega&gt;-\lambda_{1,s}$, $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2n}{(n-2s)^+}$, $\lambda_{1,s}&gt;0$ is the lowest eigenvalue of $(-\Delta)^s + |x|^2$. The fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$ is characterized as $\mathcal{F}((-\Delta)^{s}u)(\xi)=|\xi|^{2s} \mathcal{F}(u)(\xi)$ for $\xi \in \R^n$, where $\mathcal{F}$ denotes the Fourier transform. This solves an open question in \cite{SS} concerning the uniqueness of ground states.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior for the 3D Navier-Stokes with Navier boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ with initial velocity $u_0$ square-integrable, divergence-free and tangent to $\partial \Omega$. We supplement the equations with the Navier friction boundary conditions $u \cdot n = 0$ and $[(2Su)n + \alpha u]_{\rm tang} = 0$, where $n$ is the unit exterior normal to $\partial \Omega$, $Su = (Du + (Du)^t)/2$, $\alpha \in C^0(\partial\Omega)$ is the boundary friction coefficient and $[\cdot]_{\rm tang}$ is the projection of its argument onto the tangent space of $\partial \Omega$. We prove global existence of a weak Leray-type solution to the resulting initial-boundary value problem and exponential decay in energy norm of these solutions when friction is positive. We also prove exponential decay if friction is non-negative and the domain is not a solid of revolution. In addition, in the frictionless case $\alpha = 0$, we prove convergence of the solution to a steady rigid rotation, if the domain is a solid of revolution. We use the Galerkin method for existence, Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities, with suitable adaptations to account for the differential geometry of the boundary, and a global-in-time, integral Gronwall-type inequality.</description>

      <title>Exact controllability of incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics in $2$D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the controllability of planar incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Interior controls are obtained for problems posed in doubly-connected regions; simply-connected configurations are driven by boundary controls. Up to now, only straight channels regulated at opposing walls have been studied. Hence, the present program adds to the literature an exploration of interior controllability, extends the known boundary controllability results, and contributes ideas for treating general domains. To transship obstacles stemming from the MHD coupling and the magnetic field topology, a divide-and-control strategy is proposed. This leads to a family of nonlinear velocity-controlled sub-problems which are solved using J.-M. Coron's return method. The latter is here developed based on a reference trajectory in the domain's first cohomology space.</description>

Abstract: We consider a model consisting of differential equations coupling the time evolution of a finite number of relativistic electrons with the Newtonian dynamics of finitely many nuclei, where the former is described by the Bogoliubov-Dirac-Fock (BDF) equation of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The Cauchy problem for this model is addressed, proving a global well-posedness result. We believe that this system can be seen as a first step in the study of molecular dynamics phenomena, when both relativistic and quantum effects have to be taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of the transonic shock solution for steady isentropic Euler system with an external force in a rectangular cylinder under the three-dimensional perturbations for the incoming supersonic flow, the exit pressure and the external force. The external force has a stabilization effect on the transonic shocks in flat nozzles and the transonic shock is completely free, we do not require it passing through a fixed point. By utilizing the deformation-curl decomposition to decouple the hyperbolic and elliptic modes in the steady Euler system effectively and reformulating the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, the transonic shock problem is reduced to a deformation-curl first order system for the velocity field with nonlocal terms supplementing with an unusual second order differential boundary condition on the shock front, an algebraic equation for determining the shock front and two transport equations for the Bernoulli's quantity and the first component of the vorticity.</description>

      <title>Smooth axisymmetric transonic irrotational flows to the steady Euler equations with an external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a class of external forces, we prove the existence and uniqueness of smooth transonic flows to the one dimensional steady Euler system with an external force, which is subsonic at the inlet and flows out at supersonic speed after smoothly accelerating through the sonic point. We then investigate the structural stability of the one-dimensional smooth transonic flows with positive acceleration under axisymmetric perturbations of suitable boundary conditions, and establish the first existence and uniqueness result for smooth axisymmetric transonic irrotational flows. The key point lies on the analysis of a linear second order elliptic-hyperbolic mixed differential equation of Keldysh type with a singular term. Some weighted Sobolev spaces $H_r^m(D) (m=2,3,4)$ are introduced to deal with the singularities near the axis. Compared with the stability analysis in the two dimensional case by Weng and Xin (arXiv:2309.07468), there are several interesting new observations about the structure of the linear mixed type equation with a singular term which play crucial roles in establishing the $H^4_r(D)$ estimate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to studying the well-posedness and stability of the generalized Navier-Stokes-Maxwell (NSM) equations with the standard Ohm's law in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \in \{2,3\}$. More precisely, the global well-posedness is established in case of fractional Laplacian velocity $(-\Delta)^\alpha v$ with $\alpha = \frac{d}{2}$ for suitable data. In addition, the local well-posedness in the inviscid case is also provided for sufficient smooth data, which allows us to study the inviscid limit of associated positive viscosity solutions in the case $\alpha = 1$, where an explicit bound on the difference is given. On the other hand, in the case $\alpha = 0$ the stability near a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with a constant (or equivalently bounded) magnetic field is also obtained in which nonhomogeneous Sobolev norms of the velocity and electric fields, and the $L^\infty$ norm of the magnetic field converge to zero as time goes to infinity with an implicit rate. In this velocity damping case, the situation is different both in case of the two and a half, and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system, where an explicit rate of convergence in infinite time is computed for both the velocity and magnetic fields in nonhomogeneous Sobolev norms. Therefore, there is a gap between NSM and MHD in terms of the norm convergence of the magnetic field and the rate of decaying in time, even the latter equations can be proved as a limiting system of the former one in the sense of distributions as the speed of light tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Consensus-Based Optimization Methods Converge Globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15130v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study consensus-based optimization (CBO), which is a multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method that can globally minimize nonconvex nonsmooth functions and is amenable to theoretical analysis. Based on an experimentally supported intuition that, on average, CBO performs a gradient descent of the squared Euclidean distance to the global minimizer, we devise a novel technique for proving the convergence to the global minimizer in mean-field law for a rich class of objective functions. The result unveils internal mechanisms of CBO that are responsible for the success of the method. In particular, we prove that CBO performs a convexification of a large class of optimization problems as the number of optimizing agents goes to infinity. Furthermore, we improve prior analyses by requiring mild assumptions about the initialization of the method and by covering objectives that are merely locally Lipschitz continuous. As a core component of this analysis, we establish a quantitative nonasymptotic Laplace principle, which may be of independent interest. From the result of CBO convergence in mean-field law, it becomes apparent that the hardness of any global optimization problem is necessarily encoded in the rate of the mean-field approximation, for which we provide a novel probabilistic quantitative estimate. The combination of these results allows to obtain probabilistic global convergence guarantees of the numerical CBO method.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Anisotropic Consensus-Based Optimization in Mean-Field Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study anisotropic consensus-based optimization (CBO), a multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method capable of globally minimizing nonconvex and nonsmooth functions in high dimensions. CBO is based on stochastic swarm intelligence, and inspired by consensus dynamics and opinion formation. Compared to other metaheuristic algorithms like particle swarm optimization, CBO is of a simpler nature and therefore more amenable to theoretical analysis. By adapting a recently established proof technique, we show that anisotropic CBO converges globally with a dimension-independent rate for a rich class of objective functions under minimal assumptions on the initialization of the method. Moreover, the proof technique reveals that CBO performs a convexification of the optimization problem as the number of agents goes to infinity, thus providing an insight into the internal CBO mechanisms responsible for the success of the method. To motivate anisotropic CBO from a practical perspective, we further test the method on a complicated high-dimensional benchmark problem, which is well understood in the machine learning literature.</description>

      <title>Isometric extensions of Anosov flows via microlocal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical framework developed by Brin, Pesin and others to study ergodicity and mixing properties of isometric extensions of volume-preserving Anosov flows, using the microlocal framework developed in the theory of Pollicott-Ruelle resonances. The approach developed in the present note is reinvested in the companion paper [arXiv:2111.14811] in order to show ergodicity of the frame flow on negatively-curved Riemannian manifolds under nearly $1/4$-pinched curvature assumption (resp. nearly $1/2$-pinched) in dimension $4$ and $4\ell+2, \ell &gt; 0$ (resp. dimension $4\ell, \ell &gt; 0$).</description>

      <title>Analysis and Simulations of a Nonlocal Gray-Scott Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gray-Scott model is a set of reaction-diffusion equations that describes chemical systems far from equilibrium. Interest in this model stems from its ability to generate spatio-temporal structures, including pulses, spots, stripes, and self-replicating patterns. We consider an extension of this model in which the spread of the different chemicals is assumed to be nonlocal, and can thus be represented by an integral operator. In particular, we focus on the case of strictly positive, symmetric, $L^1$ convolution kernels that have a finite second moment. Modeling the equations on a finite interval, we prove the existence of small-time weak solutions in the case of nonlocal Dirichlet and Neumann boundary constraints. We then use this result to develop a finite element numerical scheme that helps us explore the effects of nonlocal diffusion on the formation of pulse solutions.</description>

      <title>A single player and a mass of agents: a pursuit evasion-like game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a finite-horizon differential game of pursuit-evasion like, between a single player and a mass of agents. The player and the mass directly control their own evolution, which for the mass is given by a first order PDE of transport equation type. Using also an adapted concept of non-anticipating strategies, we derive an infinite dimensional Isaacs equation, and by dynamic programming techniques we prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution on a suitable invariant subset of a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Space-time finite element analysis of the advection-diffusion equation using Galerkin/least-square stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full space-time numerical solution of the advection-diffusion equation using a continuous Galerkin finite element method. The Galerkin/least-square method is employed to ensure stability of the discrete variational problem. In the full space-time formulation, time is considered another dimension, and the time derivative is interpreted as an additional advection term of the field variable. We derive a priori error estimates and illustrate spatio-temporal convergence with several numerical examples. We also derive a posteriori error estimates, which coupled with adaptive space-time mesh refinement provide efficient and accurate solutions. The accuracy of the space-time solutions is illustrated against analytical solutions as well as against numerical solutions using a conventional time-marching algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00290v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider arbitrary bounded discrete time series. From its statistical feature, without any use of the Fourier transform, we find an almost periodic function which suitably characterizes the corresponding time series.</description>

      <title>A mixed FEM for a time-fractional Fokker-Planck model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a mixed finite element method for the spatial approximation of a time-fractional Fokker--Planck equation in a convex polyhedral domain, where the given driving force is a function of space. Taking into account the limited smoothing properties of the model, and considering an appropriate splitting of the errors, we employed a sequence of clever energy arguments to show optimal convergence rates with respect to both approximation properties and regularity results. In particular, error bounds for both primary and secondary variables are derived in $L^2$-norm for cases with smooth and nonsmooth initial data. We further investigate a fully implicit time-stepping scheme based on a convolution quadrature in time generated by the backward Euler method. Our main result provides pointwise-in-time optimal $L^2$-error estimates for the primary variable. Numerical examples are then presented to illustrate the theoretical contributions.</description>
