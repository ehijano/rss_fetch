      <title>Tidally Trapped Two-pole Pulsations Discovered in a Close Binary with a Massive $\beta$ Cephei Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidally tilted pulsators (TTPs), whose pulsation axis aligns with the binary's semi-major axis, represent a newly established class of oscillators in binary systems. While all previously known TTPs are either $\delta$ Scuti or subdwarf B-type stars, their existence has remained unidentified in more massive $\beta$ Cephei variables. Here, we report the discovery of tidally trapped pulsations in the massive ellipsoidal variable HD~329379, based on photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our analysis reveals a $\beta$ Cephei pulsator in a 2.25-day orbit whose pulsation mode amplitude is strongly modulated with the orbital frequency. Based on our analysis, we concluded that this modulation can be explained by pulsations with significantly larger amplitude near the star's two tidal poles (apsides). We interpret this as a tidally distorted quadrupole pulsation chariacteristiced by trapped two-pole pulsations, with a pulsation axis aligned with the tidal axis. This represents the first identification of such a pulsation mode in a $\beta$ Cephei star, which differs from single-sided pulsations observed in previous works, marking a rare and important discovery. Our work extends the family of TTPs beyond $\delta$ Scuti and subdwarf B-type stars to include more massive $\beta$ Cephei variables. In particular, the two-pole pulsator HD~329379 stands out as the prototype of a new class of TTPs in massive stars. These results not only provide a new insight to probe the interior structure and evolutionary state for massive stars but also offer a unique opportunity to study the interaction between pulsations and strong tidal distortions.</description>

      <title>The Likelihood of Hosting Undetected Brown Dwarfs in the Solar Vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the spatial distribution of objects in the solar neighbourhood with a radius of 20 parsecs, and after correcting for the incompleteness of observational data, an expression was obtained for estimating the probability of finding an object at a given distance from the Sun. According to these estimates, with a probability of about 0.5, there exists a brown dwarf in the immediate solar vicinity (&lt; 1.2 pc). The possible multiplicity of this hypothetical object is discussed, as well as the reasons why it has not yet been detected.</description>

      <title>A millimeter methanol maser ring tracing the deceleration of the heat wave powered by the massive protostellar accretion outburst in G358.93-0.03 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-epoch, multi-band ALMA imaging of the new Class II millimeter methanol masers excited during the accretion outburst of the massive protostar G358.93-0.03 MM1. The highest angular resolution image (24 mas $\approx$ 160 au) reveals a nearly complete, circular ring of strong maser spots in the 217.2992 GHz ($v_t$=1) maser line that closely circumscribes the dust continuum emission from MM1. Weaker maser emission lies inside the eastern and southern halves of the maser ring, generally coincident with the centimeter masers excited during the outburst, but avoiding the densest parts of the hot core gas traced by high excitation lines of CH$_3$CN. Using a variety of fitting techniques on the image cubes of the two strongest maser lines, each observed over 3-4 epochs, we find the diameter of the ring increased by $\gtrsim$60% (from $\approx$1100 to $\approx$1800 au in the 217 GHz line) over 200 days, consistent with an average radial propagation rate of $\approx$0.01c, while the maser intensity declined exponentially. Fitting the angular extent of the millimeter masers versus time yields a power law of index 0.39$\pm$0.06, which also reproduces the observed extent of the 6.7 GHz masers in the first VLBI epoch of R. A. Burns et al. (2020). This exponent is consistent with the prediction of radius vs. time in the Taylor-von Neumann-Sedov self-similar solution for an intense spherical explosion from a point source ($R \propto t^{2/5}$). These results demonstrate the explosive nature of accretion outbursts in massive protostars and their ability to generate subluminal heat waves traceable by centimeter and millimeter masers for several months as the energy traverses the surrounding molecular material.</description>

      <title>A closer look at the young stellar group around Sh 2-295</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation is governed by multiple physical processes, making it inherently complicated. One excellent example is the Canis Major OB1/R1 Association, whose complex history of star formation is related to different episodes. Three supernova (SN) events potentially altered the environment and impacted star formation and stellar evolution. Prior investigations revealed two stellar groups of different ages associated with GU CMa and Z CMa. This work focusses on identifying the low-mass young stellar population near FZ CMa, located between these two groups and spatially related to the H II region Sh 2-295. Our main goal is to verify whether this group is age-mixed and characterise its physical properties. We analysed multi-object spectroscopic data acquired with Gemini/GMOS to search for typical features of T Tauri stars (TTs) and to determine their spectral types. Lithium absorption line ($\lambda$ 6708 $\mathring{A}$) was used as a youth indicator, while H$\alpha$ emission was investigated to probe accretion activity. We also derived ages based on optical photometry from Gaia DR3 and compared the projected spatial distribution to diffuse infrared (IR) emission. We identified 29 TTs, including six new members of the association and three Classical TTs (CTTs). The equivalent width of the Li I absorption line suggests an age of $8.1^{+2.1}_{-3.8}$ Myr, while optical photometric data indicate stellar ages ranging from $\sim$1 to 14 Myr. Younger stars are concentrated around Sh 2-295, whereas the older ones are more widely dispersed. We increased the number of known TTs related to the CMa association. Our results support a scenario of multiple star-formation episodes, including a younger group that may have been triggered by the expansion of Sh 2-295. The influence of SN events appears limited in this context.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Driven Corrugation of Collisionless Fast-Magnetosonic Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless fast-magnetosonic shocks are often treated as smooth, planar boundaries, yet observations point to organized corrugation of the shock surface. A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\beta$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.</description>

      <title>3D Radiative MHD Modeling of Particle Beam Heating of the Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While solar flares are primarily associated with enhanced ultraviolet and X-ray emission, a subset of flares exhibit significant continuum brightening in visible light and are classified as white-light flares (WLFs). Despite extensive observational and modeling efforts, the physical mechanisms responsible for the compact, short-lived photospheric brightenings in WLF kernels observed during the impulsive phase of solar flares remain uncertain. Thick-target electron-beam models typically deposit energy in the upper chromosphere, and their ability to reproduce the magnitude and spatial localization of photospheric continuum enhancements observed in white-light flare kernels remains an open question. To investigate the role of realistic atmospheric structuring and multidimensional transport in flare energy deposition, we perform three-dimensional radiative MHD simulations of electron-beam heating using the StellarBox code for beam fluxes of $10^{12}$ erg\,s$^{-1}$\,cm$^{-2}$ and low-energy cutoffs of 10--25\,keV. We then compute Fe\,I 6173\,\AA~Stokes profiles using the RH 1.5D radiative transfer code for direct comparison with Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations. The simulations produce strong upper-chromospheric heating, multiple shock fronts, and continuum enhancements up to a factor of 2.5 relative to pre-flare levels, comparable to continuum enhancements observed during strong X-class white-light flares. Comparison with one-dimensional RADYN simulations highlights the influence of fine-scale structuring on flare dynamics and continuum emission that arises in three-dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>Inferring Solar Magnetic fields From the Polarization of the Mg II h and k Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of the Mg II h and k lines holds significant diagnostic potential for measuring chromospheric magnetic fields, which are crucial for understanding the physical processes governing the energy transport and dissipation in the solar upper atmosphere, as well as the subsequent heating of the chromosphere and corona. The Chromospheric Layer Spectropolarimeter was launched twice in 2019 and 2021, successfully acquiring spectropolarimetric observations across the Mg II h and k lines. The analysis of these observations confirms the capability of these lines for inferring magnetic fields in the upper chromosphere. In this review, we briefly introduce the physical mechanisms behind the polarization of the Mg II h and k lines, including the joint action of the Zeeman and Hanle effects, the magneto-optical effect, partial frequency redistribution, and atomic level polarization. We also provide an overview of recent progress in the interpretation of the Stokes profiles of the Mg II h and k lines.</description>

      <title>Coronal flux tube illuminated by strong shock spot: New Year's Eve solar eruption of 2023-Dec-31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful solar eruptions are known to produce fast and wide shock waves in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. The relationship between the coronal shock waves, solar energetic particles and different types of radio emission is a subject of long-lasting research activity. In this work, we perform a case study of 31 December 2023 eruption that occurred near eastern limb of the Sun. It produced a X5.0 class X-ray flare, a global EUV wave, a fast $\sim3000$ km/s Coronal Mass Ejection, strong radio emissions (including several type III and type II bursts), solar energetic particles in-situ, and long duration high-energy gamma-ray emission. We employ a technique that combines the reconstructed coronal shock from observations with background coronal MHD simulations to produce shock-mediated synthetic radio spectrum, assuming local emission at plasma frequency. We show that transient high Mach number and quasi-perpendicular coronal shock region explains both a ``hot flux tube'' precursor seen in EUV observations and reverse drifting radio spectral features observed by ground-based facilities. The occurrence of this evanescent strong shock patch was observed when it propagated across pseudo-streamer's cusp where the magnetic field was particularly low. We also find evidence that, at higher coronal altitudes, the low-frequency type II radio burst detected by several spacecraft, is triggered by the interaction of the shock with the heliospheric current sheet. This study provides additional evidence that high-$M_A$ regions of coronal shock surface are instrumental in energetic particle phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Distributions of wide binary stars in theory and in Gaia data: III. Orbital momenta, masses, and manifestations of MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the censored catalog of 103,169 resolved Gaia DR3 binary stars with accurate astrometric data for each component, a new observable, object-specific parameter is computed for each pair: the projected orbital momentum. This parameter is the product of four functions of physical characteristics: total mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination angle. Using the previously estimated marginal probability densities of eccentricity and semimajor axis, and assuming an isotropic orientation of binary systems, the sample distribution of mass was adjusted using a concordance metric of the observed and synthetic distributions of orbital momenta and an ad hoc functional model. The best-fitting mass density model is found to faithfully reproduce the observed dependence of orbital momenta on apparent separation, although the absolute luminosity distributions indicate a tendency of the widest systems to more frequently include solar-type primaries. The anticipated manifestation of MOND is computed in the investigated parameter space \{separation, momentum\}. This effect is absent in the given data. The median total mass of the widest Gaia binaries is found to be somewhat higher than that of the tighter pairs, which is interpreted as a dynamical age effect.</description>

      <title>Pair Space in Classical Mechanics III. Some Four-Body Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study central configurations in the four body problem, i.e., configurations in which the forces on all the bodies point to a fixed, single point in space. The newly formulated pair-space formalism yields a set of vectorial equations that fully characterize such configurations. We investigate a sub-class of solutions in which at least two pairs of inter-body distances are equal. The only such non-collinear configurations are the tetrahedron (the unique non-planar configuration), kites and the isosceles trapezium. The specific shapes (internal angles) are determined by the ratio of the masses of the bodies. Mathematical expression are given for all these relations.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Mass Flux as a Function of Ionospheric Emission on Unmagnetized Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore ion escape from, and solar ion deposition to, \hll{an unmagnetized Earth-like planet}. We use RHybrid, an ion-kinetic electron-fluid code to simulate the global plasma interaction of unmagnetized Earth with the solar wind. We vary the global ionospheric emission rate, and quantify the resultant planetary ion escape rates ($O^+$ and $H^+$) and the solar wind deposition rate ($H^+$). We use these results to compute the net mass flux to the atmosphere and find that the solar ion deposition rate could be comparable to planetary ion escape rates. For the emission rates simulated, our results show that under typical solar wind conditions ($v_{sw} = 400 \ km \ s^{-1}$, $n_{sw} = 5 \ cm^{-3}$), the mass of the atmosphere would decrease by less than 3\% over a billion years, indicating that Earth's intrinsic magnetic field may be unnecessary for retention of its atmosphere. Lastly, we present a hypothesis suggesting that ionospheric emission may evolve through time towards a critical emission rate that occurs at a net mass flux of zero.</description>

      <title>Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project I: Overview and Implementation of the Prototype Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-field rapid sky surveys serve as critical observational methods for time-domain astronomical research. The Antarctic region, with several months of continuous dark nights annually, is an ideal site for time-domain astronomical observations. The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project aims to deploy a fleet of small telescopes, adopting an array observation model to conduct time-domain optical observations in Antarctica, featuring wide-sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, long-period staring, and simultaneous multi-band measurements. Considering the severe challenges optical telescopes face in Antarctica, including extremely low temperatures, unattended operation, and limited power supply and network transmission, we have designed and developed the Antarctic TianMu prototype telescope based on drift-scan charge-coupled device technology. In October 2022, our prototype (with an aperture of 18 cm), named AT-Proto was transported to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica aboard China's 39th Antarctic Research Expedition. It has since operated stably and reliably in the frigid environment for over two years, demonstrating the significant advantages of this technology in polar astronomical observations. The experimental observation results of AT-Proto provide a solid foundation for the subsequent construction of a time-domain astronomy observation array in Antarctica.</description>

      <title>Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project II: Data reduction and preliminary results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Program is a time-domain optical sky survey project carried out in Antarctica, capable of large sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, and long-period staring. It utilizes the exceptional observing conditions in Antarctica to conduct high-cadence time-domain sky surveys. At present, we have successfully developed an 18-cm aperture Antarctic TianMu prototype, which has been deployed at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica for two consecutive years of trouble-free observations, during which more than 300,000 original images were obtained. This paper systematically outlines the commissioning data of the prototype telescope in 2023, the primary data processing pipeline, and the preliminary data products. The core pipeline encompasses four key stages: Data preprocessing, instrumental effect correction, astrometric solution, and full-field stellar photometry. Here, we release the 2023 data products, which specifically include reduced image data and a photometric catalog, for which, preliminary analyses demonstrate robust performance. Using Gaia Data Release 3 as a reference catalog, the astrometric precision, quantified by the root mean square of positional errors, is determined to be better than approximately 2 arcseconds, validating the observational capabilities of the system. For a 30-second exposure, the detection limit in the G-band is achieved at 15.00~mag, with a detection threshold of 1.5~$\sigma$. The photometric errors are below 0.1~mag for the majority of stars brighter than 14.00~mag. Furthermore, it improves significantly, reaching better than 0.01~mag for most stars brighter than 11.00~mag and 12.00~mag when employing the adaptive aperture photometry and point spread function photometry methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>photoD with Rubin's Data Preview 1: first stellar photometric distances and deficit of faint blue stars. Stellar distances with Rubin's DP1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: We investigate the utility of Rubin's Data Preview 1 for estimating stellar number density profile in the Milky Way halo. Methods: Stellar broad-band near-UV to near-IR $ugrizy$ photometry released in Rubin's Data Preview 1 is used to estimate distance and metallicity for blue main sequence stars brighter than $r=24$ in three $\sim$1.1. sq.~deg. fields at southern Galactic latitudes. Results: Compared to TRILEGAL simulations of the Galaxy's stellar content by (Dal Tio, 2022), we find a significant deficit of blue main sequence turn-off stars with $22 &lt; r &lt; 24$. We interpret this discrepancy as a signature of a much steeper halo number density profile at galactocentric distances $10-50$ kpc than the cannonical $\sim1/r^3$ profile assumed in TRILEGAL simulations. Conclusions: This interpretation is consistent with earlier suggestions based on observations of more luminous, but much less numerous, evolved stellar populations, and a few pencil beam surveys of blue main sequence stars in the northern sky. These results bode well for the future Galactic halo exploration with Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Improved lanthanide constraints for the kilonova AT 2017gfo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the kilonova AT 2017gfo provide a unique opportunity to identify signatures from individual heavy elements freshly synthesised via the {\it r}-process, the nucleosynthetic channel responsible for producing $\sim$half of all trans-iron-group elements. Limitations in the available atomic data have historically hampered comprehensive line identification studies; however, renewed interest has led to the generation of improved (more complete and accurately calibrated) line lists for {\it r}-process species. Here we demonstrate the utility of such data, by exploiting newly generated line lists for the lanthanides to model the photospheric-phase 3.4d X-shooter spectrum of AT 2017gfo with the radiative transfer tool \textsc{tardis}. We find the data can only be reproduced by invoking a substantially diminished lanthanide mass fraction ($X_{\textsc{ln}}$) than that proposed by previous studies. Specifically, our model necessitates $X_{\textsc{ln}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$, a value $20 \times$ lower than previously claimed. This substantial reduction in $X_{\textsc{ln}}$ is driven by our inclusion of much more complete lanthanide line information that enables better estimation of their total contribution to the observations. We encourage future modelling works to exploit all atomic data advances, and also encourage continued efforts to generate the necessary data for the remaining {\it r}-process species of interest.</description>

      <title>Understanding Solar Flares and Energetic Events: Open questions, observational requirements, and instrumental needs over the coming decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares are the largest energy-release events in the Solar System, allowing us to study fundamental physical phenomena under extreme conditions. Those include magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration, radiation transport, and various plasma physics processes, all of which occur throughout the heliosphere and rest of the Universe. Flares and eruptive events are also components of geo-effective space weather. Their impacts from a space weather perspective are numerous, such as harm to satellites, disruption to GPS, communications and power systems, and impacts on passenger air travel. A comprehensive understanding of solar flares is therefore not just a compelling science problem, but also important for national security and infrastructure. This white paper (WP) addresses critical open science questions related to solar flares. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK has a robust and vibrant solar flare community. We are key partners in international collaborations, and also provide instrumentation for existing and upcoming ESA/NASA/JAXA space missions. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field, achieve Solar System Advisory Panel roadmap goals, and to work under the UK Space Agency's National Space Strategy Pillars. Several complementary WPs have been submitted that discuss instruments or concepts that would directly address the observational requirements we describe (including: SPARK, solar optimised IFUs, Solar-C/EUVST, and OSIRIS), as well as required numerical modelling efforts and infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Stellar modeling within regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light of current astrophysical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we obtain interior solutions and investigate structural properties of isotropic compact stars in the framework of four-dimensional regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity. For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Loop-Level Lepton Flavor Violation and Diphoton Signals in the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) could not only restore parity of the weak interaction, but also provide natural explanations of the tiny active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms. The $SU(2)_R$-breaking scalar $H_3$ can induce lepton flavor violating (LFV) effects in the minimal version of LRSM at the 1-loop order, originating from the mixing of heavy right-handed neutrinos. If $H_3$ is light, say below the GeV scale, it will lead to rich signals, e.g. the LFV muon and tauon decays $\ell_\beta \to \ell_\alpha + X$ ($X$ being either visible or invisible final states) and the anomalous supernova signatures. Combined with the diphoton coupling of $H_3$, the right-handed scale $v_R$ is excluded up to $2\times10^9$ GeV. In the future, the $v_R$ scale can be probed up to $5\times10^9$ GeV in high-precision muon experiments, and further up to $6\times10^{11}$ GeV by supernova observations.</description>

Abstract: In our alternative theory, built around the coincidence of experimental and theoretical data, three "free" parameters -- the magnetic field in the tachocline of the order of ~10^7 G (see Fig.(A.1) and Eq.(A17) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), the axion mass ma ~3.2*10^{-2} eV (see Eq. (11) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), and the asymmetric dark matter (ADM) in the Universe with mADM ~5 GeV ((see V. D. Rusov et al. (2021); A. C. Vincent et al. (2016)) -- give a complete solution to the problem of the theory of magnetic flux tubes in strong fields with 11-year variations of axion-origin photons, which are caused by and anticorrelated to the 11-year variations in density of ADM, gravitationally captured on the Sun.</description>

      <title>Photometric and spectroscopic variability of the blue supergiant rho Leo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars remains poorly understood, particularly for blue supergiants. These objects play a crucial role in the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies and exhibit pronounced photometric and spectroscopic variability, often quasi-periodic rather than strictly periodic.
  Aims. We investigate the variability of the evolved B-type star rho Leo to determine its physical properties, identify the underlying mechanisms driving its variability, and constrain its evolutionary stage.
  Methods. We analyse long-term spectroscopic and photometric datasets obtained from multiple sources, including the TESS and Kepler space missions and observations with the 1.5 m telescope in Estonia. Period analysis is performed using the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Lomb-Scargle pre-whitening, and the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform. Fundamental stellar parameters are derived by fitting synthetic line profiles computed with the FastWind code to the HARPS spectrum, while the stellar rotation inclination is estimated using the ZPEKTR code.
  Results. The He I 6678.151 A line shows significant radial-velocity and line-profile moment variations. We detect a set of periods and harmonics spanning approximately 0.8 to 35 days. Some periods remain stable over time, whereas others vary between observing seasons. A comparison of spectroscopic and photometric variability, together with phase-curve morphology, allows us to constrain the origin of several signals. In particular, the approximately 11 day period is attributed to stellar rotation, while the approximately 17 day period is linked to radial pulsations.
  Conclusions. Although the variability is quasi-periodic, most detected periods persist across multiple seasons. The wide range of timescales suggests that rho Leo is likely evolving along a blue loop following the red supergiant phase.</description>

      <title>NLTE spectral modelling for a carbon-oxygen and helium white-dwarf merger as a Ca-rich transient candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out NLTE (non local thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer simulations to determine whether explosion during the merger of a carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) with a helium (He) WD can reproduce the characteristic Ca II/[Ca II] and He I lines observed in Ca-rich transients. Our study is based on a 1D representation of a hydrodynamic simulation of a 0.6 $M_{\odot}$ CO + 0.4 $M_{\odot}$ He WD merger. We calculate both photospheric and nebular-phase spectra including treatment for non-thermal electrons, as is required for accurate modelling of He I and [Ca II]. Consistent with Ca-rich transients, our simulation predicts a nebular spectrum dominated by emission from [Ca II] 7291, 7324 angstrom and the Ca II near-infrared (NIR) triplet. The photospheric-phase synthetic spectrum also exhibits a strong Ca II NIR triplet, prominent optical absorption due to He I 5876 angstrom and He I 10830 angstrom in the NIR, as is commonly observed for Ca-rich transients. Overall, our results therefore suggest that CO+He WD mergers are a promising channel for Ca-rich transients. However, the current simulation overpredicts some He I features, in particular both He I 6678 and 7065 angstrom and shows a significant contribution from Ti II, which results in a spectral energy distribution that is substantially redder than most Ca-rich transients at peak. Additionally the Ca II nebular emission features are too broad. Future work should investigate if these discrepancies can be resolved by considering full 3D models and exploring a range of CO+He WD binary configurations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Lens Masses in Moderately to Highly Magnified Microlensing Events from Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a finite source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius, implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrained the FS effect, and therefore established lower limits for the angular Einstein radius and lens mass. Additionally, we used the DarkLensCode software to obtain the mass, distance, and brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.7$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim 0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. A DarkLensCode analysis supports these findings, estimating lens masses in the range of $\sim 0.42-1.70$ $M_{\odot}$ and dark lens probabilities exceeding 80%. These results strongly indicate that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying stellar remnant candidates.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Stars Match the Spectral Signatures of JWST's Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free SMS up to $10^6 \, M_\odot$. We establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050\,\AA) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the V-shaped Balmer break morphology is shown to be an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. With wind and macroturbulent broadening, we match LRD spectra at $z=7.76$ and $z=3.55$, including the H$\beta$ width of MoM-BH*-1 to within 4\%. We predict a luminosity-dependent observability window, $\sim10^{4}$ yr for the most luminous systems and $10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ yr if $L_\lambda(4050\,\text{\AA})$ is lower by 1--2 dex. These results provide a self-consistent alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggest JWST may be witnessing luminous stages of SMBH progenitors before collapse.</description>

Abstract: We show that the helicity flux density is distinguished from magnetic helicity by analysing Hopf solitons. The electromagnetic (EM) helicity flux and the magnetic helicity are Chern-Simons terms at different hypersurfaces. We find the helicity flux density for a point charge moving with an acceleration, extending the Li\'enard-Wiechert angular distribution of radiant power. We also derive the multipole expansion of the helicity flux density, generalizing the Larmor's formula for the radiant power. These formulae have been applied to discuss the helicity flux density in several toy models such as circular and helical motion as well as soft bremsstrahlung. We also comment on the potential applications of the EM helicity flux density to pulsar systems.</description>

Abstract: Stellar multiplicity plays a crucial role in shaping planet formation and dynamical evolution. We present a survey of 54 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) within 300 pc that exhibit significant Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric accelerations. We identified 35 TOIs with stellar companions at projected separations between $0.1^{\prime\prime}$ to $2^{\prime\prime}$ (or $10-200$ AU). We also identified 12 TOIs that could host planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions, including 6 that are newly discovered. Furthermore, we perform three-dimensional orbital characterization for 12 binaries hosting confirmed planets or planet candidates, allowing us to constrain the line-of-sight mutual inclination, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$, between the planetary and binary orbits. Combining our sample with previous measurements, we apply Bayesian hierarchical analysis to a total of 26 binary systems with S-type transiting planets ($r_p&lt;5R_{\oplus}$). Specifically, we fit the $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ distribution with both single (Rayleigh) and mixture models (two-component Rayleigh and Rayleigh-isotropic mixture). We find the mixture models are strongly favored ($\log Z\gtrsim13.9$, or $\approx$5$\sigma$), indicating the observed planet-binary $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ values likely originate from two underlying populations: one nearly aligned ($\sigma_1 = 2^{\circ}.4^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$) and one with more scattered mutual inclinations ($\sigma_2 = 23^{\circ}.6^{+8.8}_{-7.1}$). Alternatively, the misaligned systems can be equally well described by an isotropic distribution of inclinations. This observed dichotomy likely reflects different dynamical histories. Notably, the misaligned population only emerges in systems with stellar periastron distances $&gt;40$ AU while systems with close-in or eccentric stellar companions (periastron distances $&lt;40$ AU) preserve planet-binary alignment.</description>

      <title>Effects of Coronal Mass Ejection on PSR J1022+1001 and Possible Mode Change of PSR J2145-0750 in the InPTA DR2</title>

Abstract: The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) has recently published its second data release (DR2), comprising the timing analysis of seven years of data on 27 millisecond pulsars (MSPs), observed simultaneously in the 300-500 MHz (band 3) and 1260-1460 MHz (band 5), using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The low-frequency data, particularly in band 3, is highly sensitive to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations, which can be imprints of some astrophysical phenomena (scientific outliers). Here, we analyze the two outliers of possible astrophysical origin coming from the band 3 DM time series of two pulsars: PSR J1022+1001, with an ecliptic latitude of -0.06 degree, and PSR J2145-0750, one of the brightest MSPs, with multi-component profile morphology. Our study reveals compelling evidence for a coronal mass ejection (CME) event traced in the data of PSR J1022+1001, and reports evidence for a potential mode-changing event in PSR J2145-0750. By contrasting these two cases, we show that DM fluctuations due to CME interacions and intrinsic mode-changing events produce distinct observational signatures, enabling a physically informed classification of scientific outliers in PTA datasets. Extending the analyses presented here to the full sample of InPTA-DR2 pulsars is expected to reveal additional CME events, and possible mode-changing events. Such detections will not only improve our understanding of solar and pulsar magnetospheric plasma interactions but will also enable more accurate modelling of DM variations, leading to improved pulsar timing solutions, which are crucial for high-precision Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) science.</description>
