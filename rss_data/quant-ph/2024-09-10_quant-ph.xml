      <title>Bias-Field Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithm for Higher-Order Binary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an enhanced bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm to address higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. Combinatorial optimization plays a crucial role in many industrial applications, yet classical computing often struggles with complex instances. By encoding these problems as Ising spin glasses and leveraging the advancements in quantum computing technologies, quantum optimization methods emerge as a promising alternative. We apply BF-DCQO with an enhanced bias term to a HUBO problem featuring three-local terms in the Ising spin-glass model. Our protocol is experimentally validated using 156 qubits on an IBM quantum processor with a heavy-hex architecture. In the studied instances, the results outperform standard methods, including the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), quantum annealing, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Furthermore, we perform an MPS simulation and provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of a similar HUBO problem on a 433-qubit Osprey-like quantum processor. Both studied cases, the experiment on 156 qubits and the simulation on 433 qubits, can be considered as the start of the commercial quantum advantage era, Kipu dixit, and even more when extended soon to denser industry-level HUBO problems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Bidirectional Quantum Teleportation: Arbitrary bi-modal Information State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coherent states are experimentally realizable continuous variable quantum states of which preparation by lasers, as well as its manipulation and monitoring by linear optical gadgets are well established. We propose a strategy to send an arbitrary superposition of four-component bimodal entangled coherent states from a sender to a receiver who, simultaneously, tries to transmit an unknown Schrodinger Cat coherent state to sender via employing a cluster consisting of three superposition of two component bimodal entangled coherent states as the quantum channel and utilizing linear optical gadgets. Heralded detection of photons in laboratories of sender and receiver followed by classical communications of even and odd number of photons and local unitary operations, impeccably, accomplishes simultaneous faithful asymmetric bidirectional quantum teleportation with one eighth of probability of success. It is seen that not all detection events implement the protocol and, therefore, one has to locally apply displacement operator, a necessary evil. We analyze near faithful partial asymmetric bidirectional quantum teleportation and associated probability of success therein. We demonstrated that, for an intense coherent optical field, fidelity approach unity.</description>

      <title>Cavity-mediated superthermal phonon correlations in the ultrastrong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons, or vibrational quanta, are behind some of the most fundamental physical phenomena in solids, including superconductivity, Raman processes, and broken-symmetry phases. It is therefore of fundamental importance to find ways to harness phonons for controlling these phenomena and developing novel quantum technologies. However, the majority of current phonon control techniques rely on the use of intense external driving fields or strong anharmonicities, which restricts their range of applications. Here, we present a scheme for controlling the intensity fluctuations in phonon emission at room temperature based on multimode ultrastrong light--matter coupling. The multimode ultrastrong coupling regime is achieved by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to an array of nanoslots, which operates as a single-mode cavity. The extremely small mode volume of the nanoslots enables unprecedented coupling strengths in a cavity phonon-polariton system. In the far-detuned, low-cavity-frequency regime, we demonstrate that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective coupling between the phonon modes, resulting in superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium, both within the same mode and between different modes. Experimental results are in good agreement with a multimode Hopfield model. Our work paves the way for the tailoring of phonons to modify charge and energy transport in perovskite materials, with potential applications in light-collecting or emitting devices.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven entanglement forging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating a physical system with variational quantum algorithms is a well-studied approach but challenging to implement in current devices due to demands in qubit number and circuit depth. We show how limited knowledge of the system, namely the entropy of its subsystems or its entanglement structure, can be used to reduce the cost of these algorithms with entanglement forging. To do so, we simulate a Fermi-Hubbard one-dimensional chain with a parametrized hopping term, as well as atomic nuclei ${}^{28}$Ne and ${}^{60}$Ti with the nuclear shell model. Using an adaptive variational quantum eigensolver we find significant reductions in both the maximum number of qubits (up to one fourth) and the amount of two-qubit gates (over an order of magnitude) required in the quantum circuits. Our findings indicate that our method, entropy-driven entanglement forging, can be used to adjust quantum simulations to the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Cavity Control of Topological Qubits: Fusion Rule, Anyon Braiding and Majorana-Schr\"odinger Cat States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of introducing a local cavity within the center of a topological chain, revealing profound effects on the system's quantum states. Notably, the cavity induces a scissor-like effect that bisects the chain, liberating Majorana zero modes (MZMs) within the bulk. Our results demonstrate that this setup enables the observation of non-trivial fusion rules and braiding -- key signatures of non-Abelian anyons -- facilitated by the spatially selective ultra-strong coupling of the cavity photon field. These MZM characteristics can be directly probed through fermionic parity readouts and photon Berry phases, respectively. Furthermore, by leveraging the symmetry properties of fermion modes within a two-site cavity, we propose a novel method for generating MZM-polariton Schr\"odinger cat states. Our findings present a significant advancement in the control of topological quantum systems, offering new avenues for both fundamental research and potential quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>The role of data embedding in quantum autoencoders for improved anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Quantum Autoencoders (QAEs) in anomaly detection tasks is critically dependent on the choice of data embedding and ansatz design. This study explores the effects of three data embedding techniques, data re-uploading, parallel embedding, and alternate embedding, on the representability and effectiveness of QAEs in detecting anomalies. Our findings reveal that even with relatively simple variational circuits, enhanced data embedding strategies can substantially improve anomaly detection accuracy and the representability of underlying data across different datasets. Starting with toy examples featuring low-dimensional data, we visually demonstrate the effect of different embedding techniques on the representability of the model. We then extend our analysis to complex, higher-dimensional datasets, highlighting the significant impact of embedding methods on QAE performance.</description>

      <title>Generalized geometric speed limits for quantum observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging quantum information geometry, we derive generalized quantum speed limits on the rate of change of the expectation values of observables. These bounds subsume and, for Hilbert space dimension $\geq 3$, tighten existing bounds -- in some cases by an arbitrarily large multiplicative constant. The generalized bounds can be used to design "fast" Hamiltonians that enable the rapid driving of the expectation values of observables with potential applications e.g.~to quantum annealing, optimal control, variational quantum algorithms, and quantum sensing. Our theoretical results are supported by illustrative examples and an experimental demonstration using a superconducting qutrit. Possibly of independent interest, along the way to one of our bounds we derive a novel upper bound on the generalized quantum Fisher information with respect to time (including the standard symmetric logarithmic derivative quantum Fisher information) for unitary dynamics in terms of the variance of the associated Hamiltonian and the condition number of the density matrix.</description>

      <title>Solving Free Fermion Problems on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of time-dynamics and thermal states of free fermions on N = 2^n modes are known to require poly(2^n) computational classical resources. We present several such free fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with exponentially-improved, poly(n) cost. The key technique is the block-encoding of the correlation matrix into a unitary. We demonstrate how such a unitary can be efficiently realized as a quantum circuit, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians. We prove that the problem of free fermion time-dynamics is BQP-complete, thus ensuring a general exponential speedup of our approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement in the Rabi Model with the Presence of the $A^{2}$ Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model (QRM) is used to describe the light-matter interaction at the quantum level in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (Cavity QED). It consists of a two-level system (atom or qubit) coupled to a single-mode quantum field, and by introducing an atom into a cavity alters the electromagnetic mode configuration within it. In the realm of Cavity QED, a notable consequence of this alteration is the emergence of a gauge-dependent diamagnetic term referred to as the $A^{2}$ contribution. In this study, we comparatively analyze the behaviors of the QRM and the influence of the $A^{2}$ term in the light-matter quantum Hamiltonian by examining the energy spectrum properties in the strong-coupling regime. We then investigate the ground state of the system, measuring its nonclassical properties via the Wigner distribution function for different photon number distribution in Fock space. Finally, we calculate the quantum entanglement in the ground state over the Von Neumann entropy. Our findings reveal that the $A^{2}$ term and the number of cavity Fock states $N$ significantly impact the amount of the quantum entanglement, highlighting their pivotal role.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pair Generation in Nonlinear Metasurfaces with Mixed and Pure Photon Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are highly effective at manipulating classical light in the linear regime; however, effectively controlling the polarization of non-classical light generated from nonlinear resonant metasurfaces remains a challenge. Here, we present a solution by achieving polarization engineering of frequency-nondegenerate biphotons emitted via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in GaAs metasurfaces, where quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) resonances were utilized for boosting the biphoton generation. By performing a comprehensive polarization tomography, we demonstrate that the polarization of the emitted photons directly reflects the qBIC mode's far-field properties. Furthermore, we show that both the type of qBIC mode and the symmetry of the meta-atoms can be tailored to control each single-photon polarization state, and that the subsequent two-photon polarization states are nearly separable, offering potential applications in the heralded generation of single photons with adjustable polarization. This work provides a significant step towards utilizing metasurfaces to not only generate quantum light but also engineer their polarization, a critical aspect for future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Parallax: A Compiler for Neutral Atom Quantum Computers under Hardware Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among different quantum computing technologies, neutral atom quantum computers have several advantageous features, such as multi-qubit gates, application-specific topologies, movable qubits, homogenous qubits, and long-range interactions. However, existing compilation techniques for neutral atoms fall short of leveraging these advantages in a practical and scalable manner. This paper introduces Parallax, a zero-SWAP, scalable, and parallelizable compilation and atom movement scheduling method tailored for neutral atom systems, which reduces high-error operations by 25% and increases the success rate by 28% on average compared to the state-of-the-art technique.</description>

      <title>Low Depth Phase Oracle Using a Parallel Piecewise Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the important task of applying a phase $exp(i f(x))$ to a computational basis state $\left| x \right&gt;$. The closely related task of rotating a target qubit by an angle depending on $f(x)$ is also studied. Such operations are key in many quantum subroutines, and often the function $f$ can be well-approximated by a piecewise linear composition. Examples range from the application of diagonal Hamiltonian terms (such as the Coulomb interaction) in grid-based many-body simulation, to derivative pricing algorithms. Here we exploit a parallelisation of the piecewise approach so that all constituent elementary rotations are performed simultaneously, that is, we achieve a total rotation depth of one. Moreover, we explore the use of recursive catalyst 'towers' to implement these elementary rotations efficiently. Depending on the choice of implementation strategy, we find a depth as low as $O(log n + log S)$ for a register of $n$ qubits and a piecewise approximation of $S$ sections. In the limit of multiple repetitions of the oracle, each instance has an $O(S \cdot n)$ T-count.</description>

      <title>Training quantum machine learning model on cloud without uploading the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the linearity of quantum unitary operations, we propose a method that runs the parameterized quantum circuits before encoding the input data. It enables a dataset owner to train machine learning models on quantum cloud computation platforms, without the risk of leaking the information of the data. It is also capable of encoding a huge number of data effectively at a later time using classical computations, thus saving the runtime on quantum computation devices. The trained quantum machine learning model can be run completely on classical computers, so that the dataset owner does not need to have any quantum hardware, nor even quantum simulators. Moreover, the method can mitigate the encoding bottom neck by reducing the required circuit depth from $O(2^{n})$ to $n/2$. These results manifest yet another advantage of quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning models over existing classical neural networks, and broaden the approaches for data security.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of quantum computation and error correction with a tesseract code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical milestone for quantum computers is to demonstrate fault-tolerant computation that outperforms computation on physical qubits. The tesseract subsystem color code protects four logical qubits in 16 physical qubits, to distance four. Using the tesseract code on Quantinuum's trapped-ion quantum computers, we prepare high-fidelity encoded graph states on up to 12 logical qubits, beneficially combining for the first time fault-tolerant error correction and computation. We also protect encoded states through up to five rounds of error correction. Using performant quantum software and hardware together allows moderate-depth logical quantum circuits to have an order of magnitude less error than the equivalent unencoded circuits.</description>

      <title>Mechanically-intermixed indium superconducting connections for microwave quantum interconnects</title>

Abstract: Superconducting coaxial cables represent critical communication channels for interconnecting superconducting quantum processors. Here, we report mechanically-intermixed indium joins to aluminum coaxial cables for low loss quantum interconnects. We describe an ABCD matrix formalism to characterize the total resonator internal quality factor ($Q_i$) and any contact ($R_{cont}$) or shunt resistance ($R_{shunt}$) associated with the mechanically-intermixed indium joins. We present four resonator test systems incorporating three indium join methods over the typical frequency range of interest (3-5.5GHz) at temperatures below $20mK$. We measure high internal quality factor aluminum cables ($Q_i = 1.55 \pm 0.37 x 10^6$) through a push-to-connect indium join of the outer conductor that capacitively couples the inner conductor for reflection measurements. We then characterize the total internal quality factors of modes of a cable resonator with a push-to-connect superconducting cable-splice at the midpoint to find mean $Q_i = 1.40 x 10^6$ and $Q_i = 9.39 x 10^5$ for even and odd-modes respectively and use an ABCD matrix model of the system to extract $R_{cont} = 6x10^{-4} \Omega$ for the indium join of the inner conductor. Finally, we demonstrate indium press-mold cable-to-chip connections where the cable-to-chip join is placed at a current node and voltage node through varying on-chip waveguide lengths with mean $Q_i = 1.24 x 10^6$ and $Q_i = 1.07 x 10^6$ respectively to extract $R_{cont} = 8.5x10^{-4} \Omega$ and $R_{shunt} = 1.3x10^7 \Omega$ for the interface. With these techniques, we demonstrate a set of low-loss methods to join superconducting cables for future quantum</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Security over Federated Learning via Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become one of the standard approaches for deploying machine learning models on edge devices, where private training data are distributed across clients, and a shared model is learned by aggregating locally computed updates from each client. While this paradigm enhances communication efficiency by only requiring updates at the end of each training epoch, the transmitted model updates remain vulnerable to malicious tampering, posing risks to the integrity of the global model. Although current digital signature algorithms can protect these communicated model updates, they fail to ensure quantum security in the era of large-scale quantum computing. Fortunately, various post-quantum cryptography algorithms have been developed to address this vulnerability, especially the three NIST-standardized algorithms - Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of these three NIST-standardized PQC algorithms for digital signatures within the FL procedure, covering a wide range of models, tasks, and FL settings. Our results indicate that Dilithium stands out as the most efficient PQC algorithm for digital signature in federated learning. Additionally, we offer an in-depth discussion of the implications of our findings and potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Expressing and Analyzing Quantum Algorithms with Qualtran</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing's transition from theory to reality has spurred the need for novel software tools to manage the increasing complexity, sophistication, toil, and fallibility of quantum algorithm development. We present Qualtran, an open-source library for representing and analyzing quantum algorithms. Using appropriate abstractions and data structures, we can simulate and test algorithms, automatically generate information-rich diagrams, and tabulate resource requirements. Qualtran offers a standard library of algorithmic building blocks that are essential for modern cost-minimizing compilations. Its capabilities are showcased through the re-analysis of key algorithms in Hamiltonian simulation, chemistry, and cryptography. Architecture-independent resource counts output by Qualtran can be forwarded to our implementation of cost models to estimate physical costs like wall-clock time and number of physical qubits assuming a surface-code architecture. Qualtran provides a foundation for explicit constructions and reproducible analysis, fostering greater collaboration within the growing quantum algorithm development community.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced dark matter detection with in-cavity control: mitigating the Rayleigh curse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is a fundamental puzzle in modern physics. A major approach of searching for dark matter relies on detecting feeble noise in microwave cavities. However, the quantum advantages of common quantum resources such as squeezing are intrinsically limited by the Rayleigh curse -- a constant loss places a sensitivity upper bound on these quantum resources. In this paper, we propose an in-situ protocol to mitigate such Rayleigh limit. The protocol consists of three steps: in-cavity quantum state preparation, axion accumulation with tunable time duration, and measurement. For the quantum source, we focus on the single-mode squeezed state (SMSS), and the entanglement-assisted case using signal-ancilla pairs in two-mode squeezed state (TMSS), where the ancilla does not interact with the axion. From quantum Fisher information rate evaluation, we derive the requirement of cavity quality factor, thermal noise level and squeezing gain for quantum advantage. When the squeezing gain becomes larger, the optimal axion accumulation time decreases to reduce loss and mitigate the Rayleigh curse -- the quantum advantage keeps increasing with the squeezing gain. Overall, we find that TMSS is more sensitive in the low temperature limit. In the case of SMSS, as large gain is required for advantage over vacuum, homodyne is sufficient to achieve optimality. For TMSS, anti-squeezing and photon counting is necessary to be optimal. Thanks to the recent advance in magnetic-field-resilient in-cavity squeezing and rapidly coupling out for photon counting, the proposed protocol is compatible with axion detection scenario.</description>

      <title>Qubit Mapping: The Adaptive Divide-and-Conquer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The qubit mapping problem (QMP) focuses on the mapping and routing of qubits in quantum circuits so that the strict connectivity constraints imposed by near-term quantum hardware are satisfied. QMP is a pivotal task for quantum circuit compilation and its decision version is NP-complete. In this study, we present an effective approach called Adaptive Divided-And-Conqure (ADAC) to solve QMP. Our ADAC algorithm adaptively partitions circuits by leveraging subgraph isomorphism and ensuring coherence among subcircuits. Additionally, we employ a heuristic approach to optimise the routing algorithm during circuit partitioning. Through extensive experiments across various NISQ devices and circuit benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed ADAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art method. Specifically, ADAC shows an improvement of nearly 50\% on the IBM Tokyo architecture. Furthermore, ADAC exhibits an improvement of around 18\% on pseudo-realistic circuits implemented on grid-like architectures with larger qubit numbers, where the pseudo-realistic circuits are constructed based on the characteristics of widely existing realistic circuits, aiming to investigate the applicability of ADAC. Our findings highlight the potential of ADAC in quantum circuit compilation and the deployment of practical applications on near-term quantum hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction of motional dephasing using optical dressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining the coherence in quantum systems is interesting in both fundamental physics and quantum information processing. In particular, suppressing the dephasing caused by thermal fluctuations in quantum systems can potentially enable functional quantum devices. Techniques to reduce motional dephasing of quantum superpositions include spin echo and bang-bang. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel protocol on a collective quantum superposition state known as a Rydberg polariton. These collective states are potentially important in the context of single photon sources, optical transistor, all-optical quantum gates and fast read-out of quantum information. However progress in Rydberg polariton quantum technology has been hindered by fast motional dephasing on which no effective methods exist for undoing it. Here, we show how our protocol via optical dressing using Raman lasers cancels dephasing and enhances coherence times by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>High purity two-dimensional levitated mechanical oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, levitated optomechanics has delivered on the promise of reaching the motional quantum ground state. An important next milestone of the field would be the generation of mechanical entanglement. An ideal candidate is the two-dimensional motion in the polarization plane of an optical tweezer inside an optical cavity, where optical and mechanical modes are coupled via coherent scattering. Necessary conditions towards this achievement are two-dimensional ground state cooling along with substantial spectral overlap between the two modes. The latter condition is required to generate the necessary correlations, but unfortunately, it hinders efficient cooling thus narrowing the useful parameter space. In this work, we report the achievement of a high purity two-dimensional state in a regime where the strong optomechanical coupling induces the desired spectral superposition between oscillations in different directions, as reflected in the non-trivial spectral shape of the detected cavity field. As a result, significant correlations consistently arise between any pair of orthogonal directions, preventing the motion from being reduced to two independent one-dimensional oscillators and leading to higher purity compared to that scenario. Our system serves as an excellent platform for realizing continuous variable entanglement in two-dimensional motion.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits with Josephson junctions distinguish themselves from other types of quantum computing architectures by having easily controllable metastable computational states (the so-called phase qubits) with a very large ratio of their respective lifetimes. In this pedagogical note I describe how we can use this remarkable property of the phase qubits to further test the validity of the superposition principle in the macroscopic quantum regime by simulating the kaon mixing mechanism of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection for Real-World Cyber-Physical Security using Quantum Hybrid Support Vector Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical control systems are critical infrastructures designed around highly responsive feedback loops that are measured and manipulated by hundreds of sensors and controllers. Anomalous data, such as from cyber-attacks, greatly risk the safety of the infrastructure and human operators. With recent advances in the quantum computing paradigm, the application of quantum in anomaly detection can greatly improve identification of cyber-attacks in physical sensor data. In this paper, we explore the use of strong pre-processing methods and a quantum-hybrid Support Vector Machine (SVM) that takes advantage of fidelity in parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently and effectively flatten extremely high dimensional data. Our results show an F-1 Score of 0.86 and accuracy of 87% on the HAI CPS dataset using an 8-qubit, 16-feature quantum kernel, performing equally to existing work and 14% better than its classical counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of geometric and symmetry techniques in quantum and classical information processing has a long tradition across the physical sciences as a means of theoretical discovery and applied problem solving. In the modern era, the emergent combination of such geometric and symmetry-based methods with quantum machine learning (QML) has provided a rich opportunity to contribute to solving a number of persistent challenges in fields such as QML parametrisation, quantum control, quantum unitary synthesis and quantum proof generation. In this thesis, we combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with techniques from differential geometry and topology to address these challenges. We present a large-scale simulated dataset of open quantum systems to facilitate the development of quantum machine learning as a field. We demonstrate the use of deep learning greybox machine learning techniques for estimating approximate time-optimal unitary sequences as geodesics on subRiemannian symmetric space manifolds. Finally, we present novel techniques utilising Cartan decompositions and variational methods for analytically solving quantum control problems for certain classes of Riemannian symmetric space. Owing to its multidisciplinary nature, this work contains extensive supplementary background information in the form of Appendices. Each supplementary Appendix is tailored to provide additional background material in a relatively contained way for readers whom may be familiar with some, but not all, of these diverse scientific disciplines. The Appendices reproduce or paraphrase standard results in the literature with source material identified at the beginning of each Appendix. Proofs are omitted for brevity but can be found in the cited sources and other standard texts.</description>

      <title>Fast multiplexed superconducting qubit readout with intrinsic Purcell filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate qubit measurement remains a critical challenge on the path to fault-tolerant quantum computing. In superconducting quantum circuits, fast qubit measurement has been achieved using a dispersively coupled resonator with a large external linewidth. This necessitates the use of a Purcell filter that protects the qubit from relaxation through the readout channel. Here we show that a readout resonator and filter resonator, coupled to each other both capacitively and inductively, can produce a compact notch-filter circuit that effectively eliminates the Purcell decay channel through destructive interference. By utilizing linewidths as large as 42 MHz, we perform 56-ns simultaneous readout of four qubits and benchmark an average assignment fidelity of 99.77%, with the highest qubit assignment fidelity exceeding 99.9%. These results demonstrate a significant advancement in speed and fidelity for multiplexed superconducting qubit readout.</description>

      <title>Platonic dynamical decoupling sequences for qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the NISQ era, where quantum information processing is hindered by the decoherence and dissipation of elementary quantum systems, developing new protocols to extend the lifetime of quantum states is of considerable practical and theoretical importance. A prominent method, called dynamical decoupling, uses a carefully designed sequence of pulses applied to a quantum system, such as a qudit (a d-level quantum system), to suppress the coupling Hamiltonian between the system and its environment, thereby mitigating dissipation. While dynamical decoupling of qubit systems has been widely studied, the decoupling of qudit systems has been far less explored and often involves complex sequences and operations. In this work, we design efficient decoupling sequences composed solely of SU(2) rotations and based on tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral point groups, which we call Platonic sequences. We use a generalization of the Majorana representation for Hamiltonians to develop a simple framework that establishes the decoupling properties of each Platonic sequence and show its efficiency on many examples. These sequences are universal in their ability to cancel any type of interaction with the environment for single qudits with up to 6 levels, and they are capable of decoupling up to 5-body interactions in an ensemble of interacting qubits with only global pulses, provided that the interaction Hamiltonian has no isotropic component, with the exception of the global identity. We also discuss their inherent robustness to finite pulse duration and a wide range of pulse errors, as well as their potential application as building blocks for dynamically corrected gates.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dipolar Quantum Battery with Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a magnetic dipolar system influenced by Zeeman splitting, DM interaction, and KSEA exchange interaction, with an initial focus on quantum resource dynamics and a final application in modeling a quantum battery (QB). We analyze the effects of dephasing noise and thermal equilibrium on quantum resources, such as the $l_1$-norm of coherence, quantum discord, and concurrence, by solving the Lindblad master equation and evaluating the Gibbs state. Our findings indicate that increased Zeeman splitting diminishes quantum resources under dephasing and thermal equilibrium conditions. However, when we use the Hamiltonian of this system to realize our QB, Zeeman splitting boosts performance metrics such as ergotropy, instantaneous power, capacity, and quantum coherence during cyclic charging. We observe that the axial parameter improves QB performance, with coherence reaching a saturation point, beyond which ergotropy continues to rise, introducing the concept of incoherent ergotropy and highlighting the need to understand its true origin. Both KSEA interaction and the rhombic parameter consistently enhance quantum resources across the dephasing and thermal equilibrium regimes, and thus improve QB performance. The DM interaction improves QB metrics and shields quantum resources against temperature variations in the Gibbs state but remains insensitive during dephasing dynamics. Our work uncovers complex trends, including ergotropy enhancement without quantum coherence, the preferential role of QB capacity over quantum coherence, and the phenomenon of no-work extraction despite the presence of quantum coherence. These findings facilitate a robust foundation for future research on magnetic dipolar QBs, emphasizing non-unitary charging processes, environmental effects, and practical implementations. We show that the NMR platform could be a promising testbed for simulating such QBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturization of ion trap and the precise placement of its electrodes are necessary for the integration of a microcavity to facilitate efficient ion-cavity coupling. We present a miniature monolithic ion trap made of gold-coated fused silica with high numerical aperture access. A laser writing method referred to as selective laser etching is employed to extract a trap structure from a block of fused silica. The fully monolithic structure eliminates the need for any post-fabrication alignment. Trenches are integrated into this structure such that the various electrodes on the monolithic device remain electrically isolated following their metalization via evaporative coating. We give details of the trap design and production, along with the demonstration of successful trapping of ions and characerization of the trap.</description>

Abstract: In this is work, an investigation on the two-photon Rabi Stark model as a function of the coupling strength under the effect of different Stark coupling strength values is treated. Here, we numerically explore the spectral collapse of the \textit{2pRSM} as a function of the qubit-cavity field coupling strength to gain further physical insights. Also, the visualization of Wigner function in purpose to study the non-classicality in ground-state of the system. At the last, we measure the quantum entanglement via von Neumann Entropy for different ratios of the Stark coupling strength. This work deepens the understanding of the role played by the Stark coupling strength determining the quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Gaussian geometric discord, entanglement and EPR-steering of two rotational mirrors in a double Laguerre-Gaussian cavity optomechanics in the presence of YIG sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EPR steering is a nonclassical correlation that exhibits properties intermediate to entanglement and Bell nonlocality, providing a valuable resource for quantum communication and computation. In this work, we propose a theoretical scheme to investigate stationary gaussian quantum steering, entanglement and Gaussian geometric discord of two spatially separated rotating mirrors (Rms) in a double-Laguerre-Gaussian cavity (DLGC). Each cavity is derived by Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam, and a Yttrium Iron Garnet sphere (YIG) is injected in the intersection of the two cavities. We employ Gaussian quantum steering to characterize the steerability between the Rms. The logarithmic negativity measure is used to quantify the amount of entanglement. We quantify all nonclassical correlations between the Rms by harnessing the Gaussian geometric discord (GGD) measure. Our results indicate that various physical parameters, including the temperature, detuning of the magnon mode frequency, orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the LG cavity modes, the coupling between magnon and cavity mode, the mass of the Rms, each play distinct roles in establishing ${\rm Rm_1-Rm_2}$ entanglement. We characterize the entanglement of the two Rms under ambient temperature (300 K). Stationary entanglement is optimal by adjusting the values of Rms frequency and photon-magnon coupling. We show that the stationary entanglement is fragile under thermal effects. Besides, the GGD demonstrates strong resilience to thermal noise, and this can be further enhanced by increasing the mass of the Rms. Under experimentally accessible parameters and with adjusted ratio between the angular frequencies, we achieve both one-way and two-way steering. Finally, we address the feasibility of our proposal based on the present experiments.</description>

      <title>On-demand single microwave photon source in a superconducting circuit with pulse-level frequency tunability over two octaves of bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new method of generating single microwave photons in superconducting circuits. We theoretically show that pure single microwave photons can be generated on demand and tuned over a large frequency band by making use of Landau-Zener transitions under a rapid sweep of a control parameter. We devise a protocol that enables pulse-level control of the frequency of the emitted photon over two octaves, without requiring extensive calibration. Additionally, we make theoretical estimates of the generation efficiency, tunability, purity, and linewidth of the photons emitted using this method for both charge and flux qubit-based architectures. We also provide estimates of optimal device parameters for these architectures in order to realize the device.</description>

      <title>How to integrate a miniature optical cavity in a linear ion trap: shielding dielectrics and trap symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One method of scaling up quantum systems is to adopt a modular approach. In the ion trap architecture, an efficient photonic interface between independent linear ion traps would allow for such expansion. To this end, an optical cavity with a small mode volume can be utilised to enhance the photon emission probability from the ion. Miniature fibre-based Fabry-Perot cavities have been integrated into three-dimensional Paul traps that hold a single ion, whereas an efficient interface between an optical cavity and a linear trap that can keep multiple ions has remained elusive. This presents a barrier for combining the benefits of the motional coupling in a chain of ions with optical interface between ion traps. In this paper, we show that simple electrically conductive shielding of the fibres could provide substantial advantage in mitigating the adverse effects of stray charges and motional heating by dielectrics. We also reveal that the conductive shields are not compatible with the conventional radio frequency (rf) drive in ion traps but using two rf signals with opposite phases can solve this issue. Furthermore the role played by the symmetry of the electrodes when incorporating an element that disrupts the translational symmetry of a linear trap is elucidated analytically. As a result it is realized that two-dimensional implementation of a linear ion trap such as a surface trap is inherently not suitable for integrating a shielded miniature optical cavity due to the lack of geometrical symmetry. Based on the insights obtained through the analysis, we identify essential components and a design strategy that should be incorporated in a linear ion trap for successful integration of a miniature optical cavity.</description>

      <title>A Novel Efficient Multiparty Semi-Quantum Secret Sharing Protocol Using Entangled States for Sharing Specific Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Younes et al. proposed an efficient multi-party semi-quantum secret sharing (SQSS) scheme that generalizes Tian et al.'s three-party protocol \cite{Tian2021} to accommodate multiple participants. This scheme retains the original advantages, such as high qubit efficiency and allowing the secret dealer, Alice, to control the message content. However, He et al. \cite{He2024} identified a vulnerability in Tian et al.'s protocol to the double CNOT attack (DCNA), which also affects the generalized scheme. In response, He et al. proposed an improved protocol to address this issue. Despite these improvements, their protocol is limited to two participants and remains a primarily two-way communication scheme, which does not fully prevent the Trojan horse attack without expensive quantum devices such as photon number splitters (PNS) and wavelength filters (WF). To address these issues, this paper develops a novel multi-party SQSS scheme using the quantum property between Bell states and the Hadamard operation to detect eavesdroppers. This new scheme is secure against the DCNA, intercept-resend attack, and collective attack. It employs a fully one-way communication scheme, entirely preventing the Trojan horse attack without costly quantum devices, aligning with the semi-quantum environment's original intent. This new protocol also offers better qubit efficiency and allows Alice to share specific secrets.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parity Measurements and Efficient Large Multi-component Cat State Preparation with Quantum Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized parity measurements are instrumental for the preparation of non-trivial quantum states and the detection of errors in error correction codes. Here, we detail a proposal for efficient and robust generalized parity measurements based on Quantum Signal Processing. Most strikingly, given access to an evolution generated by a one-to-all coupling interaction Hamiltonian between a measurement qubit and the measured system, the desired measurement can be implemented in constant time determined only by the interaction rate. The proposed generalized parity measurement can be used to efficiently prepare high-fidelity multi-component cat states in the setting of superconducting cavity quantum electrodynamics. We benchmark the state-preparation protocol through numerical simulations with realistic system parameters. We show that a 20-component cat state with $400$ photons can be prepared with success probability $&gt;2\%$ and a fidelity $\approx 90\%$ limited by the cavity decay and nonlinear qubit-cavity coupling rates. Our results pave the way for the realization of a wide range of useful non-classical states consisting of a large number of excitations.</description>

      <title>Learning to Classify Quantum Phases of Matter with a Few Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the identification of quantum phases of matter, at zero temperature, when only part of the phase diagram is known in advance. Following a supervised learning approach, we show how to use our previous knowledge to construct an observable capable of classifying the phase even in the unknown region. By using a combination of classical and quantum techniques, such as tensor networks, kernel methods, generalization bounds, quantum algorithms, and shadow estimators, we show that, in some cases, the certification of new ground states can be obtained with a polynomial number of measurements. An important application of our findings is the classification of the phases of matter obtained in quantum simulators, e.g., cold atom experiments, capable of efficiently preparing ground states of complex many-particle systems and applying simple measurements, e.g., single qubit measurements, but unable to perform a universal set of gates.</description>

      <title>Towards Distributed Quantum Error Correction for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing as a promising technology can utilize stochastic solutions instead of deterministic approaches for complicated scenarios for which classical computing is inefficient, provided that both the concerns of the error-prone nature of qubits and the limitation of the number of qubits are addressed carefully. In order to address both concerns, a new qubit-based Distributed Quantum Error Correction (DQEC) architecture is proposed in which three physical qubits residing on three Quantum Processing Units (QPU) are used to form a logical qubit. This paper illustrates how three QPUs collaboratively generate a joint quantum state in which single bit-flip and phase-flip errors can be properly resolved. By reducing the number of qubits required to form a logical qubit in the proposed architecture, each QPU with its limited number of physical qubits can accommodate more logical qubits than when it has to devote its three physical qubits for each logical qubit. The functional correctness of the proposed architecture is evaluated through the Qiskit tool and stabilizer generators. Moreover, the fidelity of input and output quantum states, the complexity of the proposed designs, and the dependency between error probability and correctness of the proposed architecture are analyzed to prove its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of atom interrogation using photonic integrated circuits anodically bonded to ultra-high vacuum envelopes for epoxy-free scalable quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable integration of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) into quantum sensors has the potential to drastically reduce sensor size, ease manufacturing scalability, and improve performance in applications where the sensor is subject to high accelerations, vibrations, and temperature changes. In a traditional quantum sensor assembly, free-space optics are subject to pointing inaccuracies and temperature-dependent misalignment. Moreover, the use of epoxy or sealants for affixing either free-space optics or PICs within a sensor vacuum envelope leads to sensor vacuum degradation and is difficult to scale. In this paper, we describe the hermetic integration of a PIC with a vacuum envelope via anodic bonding. We demonstrate utility of this assembly with two proof-of-concept atom-interrogation experiments: (1) spectroscopy of a cold-atom sample using a grating-emitted probe; (2) spectroscopy of alkali atoms using an evanescent field from an exposed ridge waveguide. This work shows a key process step on a path to quantum sensor manufacturing scalability</description>

      <title>Turning Water to Wine With Polar Impostorons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surprising result from the theory of quantum control is the degree to which the properties of a physical system can be manipulated. Both atomic and many-body solid state models admit the possibility of creating a 'driven imposter', in which the optical response of one material mimics that of a dynamically distinct system. Here we apply these techniques to polarons in polar liquids. Such quasiparticles describe solvated electrons interacting with many-body degrees of freedom of their environment. The polaron frequency, which depends on the electron concentration in the liquid, is controlled with a pump field, rendering the polaron frequency of three different liquids identical. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of 'polar impostorons', a so far purely theoretical phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the completeness relation for the eigenvectors, which is an essential assumption of quantum mechanics, remains true if the initial Hamiltonian, having a discrete spectrum, is modified by a delta potential (to be made precise by a renormalization scheme) supported at a point in two and three-dimensional compact manifolds or Euclidean spaces. The formulation can be easily extended to $N$ center case, and the case where delta interaction is supported on curves in the plane or space.</description>

      <title>Low-noise quantum frequency conversion with cavity enhancement of converted mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) which converts the frequencies of photons while preserving the quantum state is an essential technology for realizing the quantum internet and quantum interconnect. For the QFC based on the frequency downconversion from visible to the telecom wavelengths around 1500 nm, it is widely known that noise photons produced by the strong pump light used for QFC contaminate the frequency-converted photon, which degrades the quality of the quantum property of the photon after QFC. In conventional QFC experiments, noise photons are removed using external narrowband frequency filter systems. In contrast, in this study, we implement a compact QFC device integrating the cavity structure only for the converted mode. While the cavity structure can enhance not only the desired QFC efficiency but also the noise photon generation rate, we show that the cavity-enhanced QFC followed by a relatively wide bandpass filter achieves the signal-to-noise ratio comparable to the QFCs with external narrowband filters. We experimentally demonstrate the cavity-enhanced QFC using a single photon at 780 nm to 1540 nm, in which the non-classical photon statistics is clearly observed after QFC.</description>

      <title>Super-bunching light with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-classical light sources emitting bundles of N-photons with strong correlation represent versatile resources of interdisciplinary importance with applications ranging from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to quantum information processing. Yet, high-order correlations, gN(0),quantifying photon correlation, are still limited to hundreds. Here, we report the generation of a super-bunching light source in photonic crystal fiber with g2(0) reaching 5.86*104 and g5(0) up to 2.72*108, through measuring its photon number probability distributions. under giant g2(0) values, the super-bunching light source presents upturned-tail photon distributions and ubiquitous extreme multi-photon events, where 31 photons from a single light pulse at a mean of 1.99*10-4 photons per pulse have been determined. The probability of this extreme event has been enhanced by 10139 folds compared to a coherent laser with Poissonian distribution. By varying the power of the pumping laser, both photon number distributions and corresponding high-order correlations of this light source can be substantially tailored from Poissonian to super-bunching distributions. These phenomena are attributed to the synchronized nonlinear interactions in photonic crystal fibers pumping by bright squeezed light, and the theoretical simulations agree well with the experimental results. Our research showcases the ability to achieve non-classical light sources with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events, paving the way for high-order correlation imaging, extreme nonlinear optical effects, quantum information processing, and exploring light-matter interactions with multi-photon physics.</description>

      <title>Noise Suppression via Coherent Quantum Feedback: a Schr{\"o}dinger Picture Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the possibility of achieving noise suppression for finite-dimensional quantum systems through coherent feedback. For a quantum plant which is expected to evolve according to a target trajectory, noise effect potentially deforms the plant state trajectory from the desired one. It is then hoped that a coherent feedback protocol can be designed that counteracts noise. In terms of coping with transient noise, we present several conditions on coherent feedback protocols under which noise-affected trajectories can be driven back towards desired ones asymptotically. As for rejecting persistent noise, conditions on protocols are given which ensure that the error between the target and feedback-corrected trajectories in the long-time limit can be effectively suppressed. Moreover, a possible construction of coherent feedback protocols which satisfies the given conditions is provided. Our theoretical results are illustrated by an example which involves a two-qubit plant and a two-level controller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator-type Hamiltonians, it is shown that there is a relation between the energy eigenvalues of parity symmetric and PT-symmetric phases for weak coupling. The possibility of such a relation was conjectured by Ai, Bender and Sarkar on examining the imaginary part of the ground state energy using path integrals. In the weak coupling limit, we show that the conjecture is true also for the real part of the ground state energy and of the excited state energies. However, the conjecture is false for strong coupling. The analogous relation for partition functions in zero spacetime dimensions is valid for many cases, except for multi-component scalar fields in strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Contributions to the study of time dependent oscillators in Paul traps. Semiclassical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum dynamics for an ion confined within an oscillating quadrupole field, starting from two well known and elegant approaches. It is established that the Hamilton equations of motion, in both Schr\"{o}dinger and Heisenberg representations, are equivalent to the Hill equation. One searches for a linear independent solution associated to a harmonic oscillator (HO). An adiabatic invariant, which is also a constant of motion, is introduced based on the Heisenberg representation. Thus, the state of the non-autonomous system can be determined at any subsequent moment of time. The quantum states for trapped ions are demonstrated to be Fock (number) states, while the exact solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a trapped ion are exactly the quasienergy states. Semiclassical dynamics is also investigated for many-body systems of trapped ions, where the wavefunction associated to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is prepared as a Gauss package multiplied by a Hermite polynomial. We also discuss time evolution for the system under investigation and supply the propagator.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Gate Set for Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Logical Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realisation of a universal quantum computer at scale promises to deliver a paradigm shift in information processing, providing the capability to solve problems that are intractable with conventional computers. A key limiting factor of realising fault-tolerant quantum information processing (QIP) is the large ratio of physical-to-logical qubits that outstrip device sizes available in the near future. An alternative approach proposed by Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill (GKP) encodes a single logical qubit into a single harmonic oscillator, alleviating this hardware overhead in exchange for a more complex encoding. Owing to this complexity, current experiments with GKP codes have been limited to single-qubit encodings and operations. Here, we report on the experimental demonstration of a universal gate set for the GKP code, which includes single-qubit gates and -- for the first time -- a two-qubit entangling gate between logical code words. Our scheme deterministically implements energy-preserving quantum gates on finite-energy GKP states encoded in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion. This is achieved by a novel optimal control strategy that dynamically modulates an interaction between the ion's spin and motion. We demonstrate single-qubit gates with a logical process fidelity as high as 0.960 and a two-qubit entangling gate with a logical process fidelity of 0.680. We also directly create a GKP Bell state from the oscillators' ground states in a single step with a logical state fidelity of 0.842. The overall scheme is compatible with existing hardware architectures, highlighting the opportunity to leverage optimal control strategies as a key accelerant towards fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Variational Quantum Circuits Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms have emerged as promising tools for solving optimization problems on quantum computers. These algorithms leverage a parametric quantum circuit called ansatz, where its parameters are adjusted by a classical optimizer with the goal of optimizing a certain cost function. However, a significant challenge lies in designing effective circuits for addressing specific problems. In this study, we leverage the powerful and flexible Reinforcement Learning paradigm to train an agent capable of autonomously generating quantum circuits that can be used as ansatzes in variational algorithms to solve optimization problems. The agent is trained on diverse problem instances, including Maximum Cut, Maximum Clique and Minimum Vertex Cover, built from different graph topologies and sizes. Our analysis of the circuits generated by the agent and the corresponding solutions shows that the proposed method is able to generate effective ansatzes. While our goal is not to propose any new specific ansatz, we observe how the agent has discovered a novel family of ansatzes effective for Maximum Cut problems, which we call $R_{yz}$-connected. We study the characteristics of one of these ansatzes by comparing it against state-of-the-art quantum algorithms across instances of varying graph topologies, sizes, and problem types. Our results indicate that the $R_{yz}$-connected circuit achieves high approximation ratios for Maximum Cut problems, further validating our proposed agent. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of Reinforcement Learning techniques in assisting researchers to design effective quantum circuits which could have applications in a wide number of tasks.</description>

      <title>Some new considerations about the $\nu$-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper starts from a previously deduced result, in which the $\nu$-function plays the role of the normalization function of generalized hypergeometric coherent states for quantum systems with a continuous spectrum. We have generalized this idea, obtaining a new function, the generalized $\nu$-function. By defining a discrete-continuous limit, we revealed a series of interesting properties that, in the last instance, allow the formulation and solution of new integrals involving the generalized $\nu$-functions which depend on both scalar arguments as well as those containing creation and annihilation operators, which generate the generalized hypergeometric coherent states. To our knowledge, the results obtained by us do not appear in the literature.</description>

      <title>A refined Frauchiger--Renner paradox based on strong contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Frauchiger--Renner paradox derives an inconsistency when quantum theory is used to describe the use of itself, by means of a scenario where agents model other agents quantumly and reason about each other's knowledge. We observe that logical contextuality (\`a la Hardy) is the key ingredient of the FR paradox, and we provide a stronger paradox based on the strongly contextual GHZ--Mermin scenario. In contrast to the FR paradox, this GHZ--FR paradox neither requires post-selection nor any reasoning by observers who are modelled quantumly. If one accepts the universality of quantum theory including superobservers, we propose a natural extension of Peres's dictum to resolve these extended Wigner's friend paradoxes.</description>

      <title>Measuring temporal entanglement in experiments as a hallmark for integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel experimental approach to probe many-body quantum systems by developing a protocol to measure generalized temporal entropies. We demonstrate that the recently proposed generalized temporal entropies [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 033021] are equivalent to observing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a replicated system induced by a double quench protocol using local operators as probes. This equivalence, confirmed through state-of-the-art tensor network simulations for one-dimensional systems, validates the feasibility of measuring generalized temporal entropies experimentally. Our results reveal that the dynamics governed by the transverse field Ising model integrable Hamiltonian differ qualitatively from those driven by the same model with an additional parallel field, breaking integrability. They thus suggest that generalized temporal entropies can serve as a tool for identifying different dynamical classes. This work represents the first practical application of generalized temporal entropy characterization in one-dimensional many-body quantum systems and offers a new pathway for experimentally detecting integrability. We conclude by outlining the experimental requirements for implementing this protocol with state of the art quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>An encoding of argumentation problems using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a way to encode several NP-Complete problems in Abstract Argumentation to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. In this form, a solution for a QUBO problem involves minimizing a quadratic function over binary variables (0/1), where the coefficients can be represented by a symmetric square matrix (or an equivalent upper triangular version). With the QUBO formulation, exploiting new computing architectures, such as Quantum and Digital Annealers, is possible. A more conventional approach consists of developing approximate solvers, which, in this case, are used to tackle the intrinsic complexity. We performed tests to prove the correctness and applicability of classical problems in Argumentation and enforcement of argument sets. We compared our approach to two other approximate solvers in the literature during tests. In the final experimentation, we used a Simulated Annealing algorithm on a local machine. Also, we tested a Quantum Annealer from the D-Wave Ocean SDK and the Leap Quantum Cloud Service.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing versus classical solvers: Applications, challenges and limitations for optimisation problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, harnessing the power of qubits' superposition and entanglement for computational advantages over classical systems. However, scalability poses a primary challenge for these machines. By implementing a hybrid workflow between classical and quantum computing instances, D-Wave has succeeded in pushing this boundary to the realm of industrial use. Furthermore, they have recently opened up to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, expanding their applicability to many relevant problems in the field of optimisation. However, the extent of their suitability for diverse problem categories and their computational advantages remains unclear. This study conducts a comprehensive examination by applying a selection of diverse case studies to benchmark the performance of D-Wave's hybrid solver against that of industry-leading solvers such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and IPOPT. The findings indicate that D-Wave's hybrid solver is currently most advantageous for integer quadratic objective functions and shows potential for quadratic constraints. To illustrate this, we applied it to a real-world energy problem, specifically the MILP unit commitment problem. While D-Wave can solve such problems, its performance has not yet matched that of its classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Simulating Non-Markovian Dynamics in Multidimensional Electronic Spectroscopy via Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Including the effect of the molecular environment in the numerical modeling of time-resolved electronic spectroscopy remains an important challenge in computational spectroscopy. In this contribution, we present a general approach for the simulation of the optical response of multi-chromophore systems in a structured environment and its implementation as a quantum algorithm. A key step of the procedure is the pseudomode embedding of the system-environment problem resulting in a finite set of quantum states evolving according to a Markovian quantum master equation. This formulation is then solved by a collision model integrated into a quantum algorithm designed to simulate linear and nonlinear response functions. The workflow is validated by simulating spectra for the prototypical excitonic dimer interacting with fast (memoryless) and finite-memory environments. The results demonstrate, on the one hand, the potential of the pseudomode embedding for simulating the dynamical features of nonlinear spectroscopy, including lineshape, spectral diffusion, and relaxations along delay times. On the other hand, the explicit synthesis of quantum circuits provides a fully quantum simulation protocol of nonlinear spectroscopy harnessing the efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics promised by the future generation of fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Preparing Schr\"odinger cat states in a microwave cavity using a neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up quantum computing devices requires solving ever more complex quantum control tasks. Machine learning has been proposed as a promising approach to tackle the resulting challenges. However, experimental implementations are still scarce. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally a neural-network-based preparation of Schr\"odinger cat states in a cavity coupled dispersively to a qubit. We show that it is possible to teach a neural network to output optimized control pulses for a whole family of quantum states. After being trained in simulations, the network takes a description of the target quantum state as input and rapidly produces the pulse shape for the experiment, without any need for time-consuming additional optimization or retraining for different states. Our experimental results demonstrate more generally how deep neural networks and transfer learning can produce efficient simultaneous solutions to a range of quantum control tasks, which will benefit not only state preparation but also parametrized quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Finite time quantum-classical correspondence in quantum chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the importance of the quantum-classical correspondence has been recognized in numerous studies of quantum chaos, whether it still holds for finite time dynamics remains less known. We address this question in this work by performing a detailed analysis of how the quantum chaotic measure relates to the chaoticity of the finite time classical trajectories. A good correspondence between them has been revealed in both time dependent and many-body systems. In particular, we show that the dependence of the quantum chaotic measure on the chaoticity of finite time trajectories can be well captured by a function that is independent of the system. This strongly implies the universal validity of the finite time quantum-classical correspondence. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the quantum-classical correspondence and highlight the role of time for studying quantum ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Multiplexer Simplification for State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initialization of quantum states or Quantum State Preparation (QSP) is a basic subroutine in quantum algorithms. In the worst case, general QSP algorithms are expensive due to the application of multi-controlled gates required to build them. Here, we propose an algorithm that detects whether a given quantum state can be factored into substates, increasing the efficiency of compiling the QSP circuit when we initialize states with some level of disentanglement. The simplification is done by eliminating controls of quantum multiplexers, significantly reducing circuit depth and the number of CNOT gates with a better execution and compilation time than the previous QSP algorithms. Considering efficiency in terms of depth and number of CNOT gates, our method is competitive with the methods in the literature. However, when it comes to run-time and compilation efficiency, our result is significantly better, and the experiments show that by increasing the number of qubits, the gap between the temporal efficiency of the methods increases.</description>

      <title>Maximizing orientation of a three-state molecule in a cavity with analytically designed pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the precise control of a molecular polariton by strongly coupling the lowest three rotational states of a single molecule with a single-mode cavity. We examine two distinct cavity resonance configurations: a fundamental frequency cavity ($\omega_c = 2B$ with the rotational constant $B$) resonating with the lowest two rotational states, and a second harmonic cavity ($\omega_c = 4B$) coupling with the first and second excited rotational states. We propose two control schemes based on the two polariton configurations and derive the corresponding pulse-area theorems to achieve a theoretical maximum orientation of 0.7746, identical to the molecule in the absence of the cavity. The control schemes are analyzed in Carbonyl Sulfide (OCS) molecules in their ground rotational state. Our numerical simulation results demonstrate the theoretical control schemes and analyze the sensitivity of the molecular polariton orientation degree to the control field bandwidth and phases. This work provides a valuable reference for achieving maximum field-free orientation of ultracold three-state molecules in a cavity using analytically designed pulses.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation of a qutrit state via a hypergraph state in a noisy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of quantum teleportation is fundamental in the theory of quantum communication. Developing models of quantum teleportation in different physical scenario is a modern trend of research in this direction. This work is at the interface of hypergraph theory and quantum teleportation. We propose a new teleportation protocol for qutrit states in a noisy environment. This protocol utilizes a shared quantum hypergraph state between parties as quantum channels, to carry quantum information. During the preparation of the shared state different quantum noise may act on it. In this article, we consider six types of noises which are generalized for qutrits using Wyel operators. They are the qutrit-flip noise, qutrit-phase-flip noise, depolarizing noise, Markovian and non-Markovian amplitude damping channel, Markovian and non-Markovian dephasing channel, and non-Markovian depolarization noise. There are only five qutrit hypergraph states which satisfies our requirements to be used as a channel. We consider all of them in this work. For different hypergraph states and different noises we work out the analytical expressions of quantum teleportation fidelity.</description>

      <title>Circuit optimization of qubit IC-POVMs for shadow estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting information from quantum systems is crucial in quantum physics and information processing. Methods based on randomized measurements, like shadow estimation, show advantages in effectively achieving such tasks. However, randomized measurements require the application of random unitary evolution, which unavoidably necessitates frequent adjustments to the experimental setup or circuit parameters, posing challenges for practical implementations. To address these limitations, positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) have been integrated to realize real-time single-setting shadow estimation. In this work, we advance the POVM-based shadow estimation by reducing the CNOT gate count for the implementation circuits of informationally complete POVMs (IC-POVMs), in particular, the symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs), through the dimension dilation framework. We show that any single-qubit minimal IC-POVM can be implemented using at most 2 CNOT gates, while an SIC-POVM can be implemented with only 1 CNOT gate. In particular, we provide a concise form of the compilation circuit of any SIC-POVM along with an efficient algorithm for the determination of gate parameters. Moreover, we apply the optimized circuit compilation to shadow estimation, showcasing its noise-resilient performance and highlighting the flexibility in compiling various SIC-POVMs. Our work paves the way for the practical applications of qubit IC-POVMs on quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Controlling molecular dynamics by exciting atoms in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Placing an atom and a molecule in a cavity opens the door to initialize molecular dynamics by exciting a level of the atom. This approach enlarges the range of choosing the light source to trigger molecular dynamics substantially. The interplay of the atomic, molecular and photonic populations gives rise to rich dynamics. The cavity photon plays the role of a mediator between the atom and the molecule and it is found that the photonic population is rather low throughout and its evolution follows that of the molecule. Cavities are known to be subject to losses. In spite of the losses it is demonstrated that the presence of the atom gives rise to a long-lived dynamics which should be of relevance for experimental investigations. The presence of more atoms and molecules is expected to further enrich the dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for secure communication in optical space networks, it is essential to develop physical-layer scalable security solutions. In this context, we present the asymptotic security analysis of a keyless quantum private communication protocol that transmits classical information over quantum states. Different from the previous literature, our protocol sends dummy (decoy) states optimally obtained from the true information to deceive the eavesdropper. We analyze optical on-off keying (OOK) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) for several detection scenarios. Our protocol significantly improves the protocol without decoy states whenever Bob is at a technological disadvantage with respect to Eve. Our protocol guarantees positive secrecy capacity when the eavesdropper gathers up to $90-99.9\%$ (depending on the detection scenario) of the photon energy that Bob detects, even when Eve is only limited by the laws of quantum mechanics. We apply our results to the design of an optical inter-satellite link (ISL) study case with pointing losses, and introduce a new design methodology whereby the link margin is guaranteed to be secure by our protocol. Hence, our design does not require knowing thr location of the eavesdropper and or channel state: the protocol aborts whenever the channel drops below the secured margin. Our protocol can be implemented with the state of the art space proof technology. Finally, we also show the potential secrecy advantage when using (not yet available) squeezed quantum states technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Volunteer's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volunteer's dilemma is a well-known game in game theory that models the conflict players face when deciding whether to volunteer for a collective benefit, knowing that volunteering incurs a personal cost. In this work, we introduce a quantum variant of the classical volunteer's dilemma, generalizing it by allowing players to utilize quantum strategies. Employing the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein quantization framework, we analyze a multiplayer quantum volunteer's dilemma scenario with an arbitrary number of players, where the cost of volunteering is shared equally among the volunteers. We derive analytical expressions for the players' expected payoffs and demonstrate the quantum game's advantage over the classical game. In particular, we prove that the quantum volunteer's dilemma possesses symmetric Nash equilibria with larger expected payoffs compared to the unique symmetric Nash equilibrium of the classical game, wherein players use mixed strategies. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Nash equilibria we identify are Pareto optimal. Our findings reveal distinct dynamics in volunteer's dilemma scenarios when players adhere to quantum rules, underscoring a strategic advantage of decision-making in quantum settings.</description>

      <title>A Novel Finite Fractional Fourier Transform and its Quantum Circuit Implementation on Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new number theoretic definition of discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) . In this approach the DFrFT is defined as the $N \times N$ dimensional unitary representation of the generator of the arithmetic rotational group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$, which is the finite set of $\bmod N$ integer, $2\times 2$ matrices acting on the points of the discrete toroidal phase space lattice $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$, preserving the euclidean distance $\bmod N$.
  We construct explicitly, using techniques of the Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM), the $p^n$ dimensional unitary matrix representation of the group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}]$ and especially we work out in detail the one which corresponds to the generator. This is our definition of the arithmetic fractional Fourier transform (AFrFT).
  Following this definition, we proceed to the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the AFrFT, on sets of $n$ $p$-dimensional qudits with $p$ a prime integer, by introducing novel quantum subcircuits for diagonal operators with quadratic phases as well as new quantum subcircuits for multipliers by a constant. The quantum subcircuits that we introduce provide a set capable to construct quantum circuits for any element of a more general group, the group of Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT), $SL_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ of the toroidal phase space lattice. As a byproduct, extensions of the diagonal and multiplier quantum circuits for both the qudit and qubit case are given, which are useful alone in various applications. Also, we analyze the depth, width and gate complexity of the efficient AFrFT quantum circuit and we estimate its gate complexity which is of the order $O(n^2)$, its depth which is of the order $O(n)$ with depth $n$, while at the same time it has a structure permitting local interactions between the qudits.</description>

      <title>Consensus-based Distributed Quantum Kernel Learning for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Consensus-based Distributed Quantum Kernel Learning (CDQKL) framework aimed at improving speech recognition through distributed quantum computing.CDQKL addresses the challenges of scalability and data privacy in centralized quantum kernel learning. It does this by distributing computational tasks across quantum terminals, which are connected through classical channels. This approach enables the exchange of model parameters without sharing local training data, thereby maintaining data privacy and enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations on benchmark speech emotion recognition datasets demonstrate that CDQKL achieves competitive classification accuracy and scalability compared to centralized and local quantum kernel learning models. The distributed nature of CDQKL offers advantages in privacy preservation and computational efficiency, making it suitable for data-sensitive fields such as telecommunications, automotive, and finance. The findings suggest that CDQKL can effectively leverage distributed quantum computing for large-scale machine-learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resources for Pure Thermal Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the properties of Gibbs states is an important task in Quantum Chemistry and Quantum Machine Learning. Previous work has proposed a quantum algorithm which predicts Gibbs state expectation values for $M$ observables from only $\log{M}$ measurements, by combining classical shadows and quantum signal processing for a new estimator called Pure Thermal Shadows. In this work, we perform resource analysis for the circuits used in this algorithm, finding that quantum signal processing contributes most significantly to gate count and depth as system size increases. The implementation we use for this also features an improvement to the algorithm in the form of more efficient random unitary generation steps. Moreover, given the ramifications of the resource analysis, we argue that its potential utility could be constrained to Fault Tolerant devices sampling from the Gibbs state of a large, cool system.</description>

      <title>Mitigating imperfections in Differential Phase Shift Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution via Plug-and-Play architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) was originally proposed as a means to address the issue of detector side-channel attacks and enable finite secure key rates over longer distances. However, the asymmetric characteristics of the channels from the two sources to the measurement device in MDI-QKD impose constraints on successfully extracting a secure key. In this work, we present a plug-and-play scheme for MDI-QKD based on differential phase shift (DPS) encoding. Specifically, we analyze the effects of pulse-width mismatch and polarization mismatch between the pulses arriving at the measurement device. The polarization mismatch is modeled with an assumption of sharing a common reference frame, and the maximum allowable mismatch is found to be 11 degrees. Furthermore, we show that a channel length asymmetry of 176.5 km results in Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility of 0.37, thereby leading to zero secure key rates for a polarization-based MDI-QKD protocol. We then present a plug-and-play architecture for DPS-MDI-QKD as a solution to some of these issues, thereby paving the way for practical implementations of MDI protocols.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel protocol for high-fidelity qubit state preparation and measurement (SPAM) that combines standard SPAM methods with a series of in-sequence measurements to detect and remove errors. The protocol can be applied in any quantum system with a long-lived (metastable) level and a means to detect population outside of this level without coupling to it. We demonstrate the use of the protocol for three different qubit encodings in a single trapped $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^+$ ion. For all three, we achieve the lowest reported SPAM infidelities of $7(4) \times 10^{-6}$ (optical qubit), $5(4) \times 10^{-6}$ (metastable-level qubit), and $8(4) \times 10^{-6}$ (ground-level qubit).</description>

      <title>Hardware-Efficient Fault Tolerant Quantum Computing with Bosonic Grid States in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds the promise of solving classically intractable problems. Enabling this requires scalable and hardware-efficient quantum processors with vanishing error rates. This perspective manuscript describes how bosonic codes, particularly grid state encodings, offer a pathway to scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing in superconducting circuits. By leveraging the large Hilbert space of bosonic modes, quantum error correction can operate at the single physical unit level, therefore reducing drastically the hardware requirements to bring fault-tolerant quantum computing to scale. Going beyond the well-known Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code, we discuss how using multiple bosonic modes to encode a single qubit offers increased protection against control errors and enhances its overall error-correcting capabilities. Given recent successful demonstrations of critical components of this architecture, we argue that it offers the shortest path to achieving fault tolerance in gate-based quantum computing processors with a MHz logical clock rate.</description>

      <title>Non-local resources for error correction in quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling fault-tolerant quantum computing is essential to realize the potential of quantum computation. Surface code has been the best choice over the last decade because of its effective error suppression capability. However, it suffers from a low encoding rate, requiring a vast number of physical qubits for large-scale quantum computation. In contrast, hypergraph product codes present a promising alternative, as both their encoding rate and distance scale with block size. Despite this, their non-local stabilizers necessitate long-range connectivity for stabilizer measurements, posing significant experimental challenges. Recent advancements have shown how to deterministically perform high-fidelity cavity enabled non-local many-body gates, enabling the creation of non-local cat states. We integrate the non-local resource into the DiVincenzo-Aliferis method for fault-tolerant stabilizer measurement. We apply the scheme to long-range quantum hypergraph product codes, performing circuit-level noise simulations including the the cavity error model, achieving a promising threshold. Additionally, we propose a tri-layer architectural layout for scheduling stabilizer measurements, enhancing circuit parallelizability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first end-to-end integration of high-performance computing (HPC), reliable quantum computing, and AI in a case study on catalytic reactions producing chiral molecules. We present a hybrid computation workflow to determine the strongly correlated reaction configurations and estimate, for one such configuration, its active site's ground state energy. We combine 1) the use of HPC tools like AutoRXN and AutoCAS to systematically identify the strongly correlated chemistry within a large chemical space with 2) the use of logical qubits in the quantum computing stage to prepare the quantum ground state of the strongly correlated active site, demonstrating the advantage of logical qubits compared to physical qubits, and 3) the use of optimized quantum measurements of the logical qubits with so-called classical shadows to accurately predict various properties of the ground state including energies. The combination of HPC, reliable quantum computing, and AI in this demonstration serves as a proof of principle of how future hybrid chemistry applications will require integration of large-scale quantum computers with classical computing to be able to provide a measurable quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Jaynes-Cummings model in a unitary fractional-time description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-evolution operator derived from the fractional-time Schr\"odinger equation is considered non-unitary because it fails to preserve the norm of the vector state as time evolves. However, considering the time-dependent non-Hermitian quantum formalism to the time-fractional dynamics, it has been demonstrated that a unitary evolution can be achieved for a traceless two-level Hamiltonian. This is accomplished by considering a dynamical Hilbert space embedding a time-dependent metric operator, with respect to which the system evolves in a unitary manner, allowing for the proper interpretation of standard quantum mechanical probabilities. In this work, we apply the unitary description to the Jaynes-Cummings model in the fractional-time scenario for investigating the modification in terms of the fractional-order parameter $\alpha$ of the well-known dynamical properties, such as the atomic population inversion of the two-level atom, and the atom-field entanglement when the atom starts in its excited state and field is initially in a coherent state.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum gates for exchange-only qubits using simultaneous exchange pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin qubit types is the universal control using only voltage controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from non-orthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit and two-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of $X$ rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wasserstein Compilation: Unitary Compilation using the Quantum Earth Mover's Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in the development of quantum computers, the practical application of quantum algorithms remains outside the current range of so-called noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Now and beyond, quantum circuit compilation (QCC) is a crucial component of any quantum algorithm execution. Besides translating a circuit into hardware-specific gates, it can optimize circuit depth and adapt to noise. Variational quantum circuit compilation (VQCC) optimizes the parameters of an ansatz according to the goal of reproducing a given unitary transformation. In this work, we present a VQCC-objective function called the quantum Wasserstein compilation (QWC) cost function based on the quantum Wasserstein distance of order 1. We show that the QWC cost function is upper bound by the average infidelity of two circuits. An estimation method based on measurements of local Pauli-observable is utilized in a generative adversarial network to learn a given quantum circuit. We demonstrate the efficacy of the QWC cost function by compiling a single-layer hardware efficient ansatz (HEA) as both the target and the ansatz and comparing other cost functions such as the Loschmidt echo test (LET) and the Hilbert-Schmidt test (HST). Finally, our experiments demonstrate that QWC as a cost function can mitigate the barren plateaus for the particular problem we consider.</description>

Abstract: We provide a mode-sum prescription to directly compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) for scalar fields in the Boulware vacuum. The method generalizes the recently developed extended coordinate method which was previously only applicable to Hartle-Hawking states. We exhibit the accuracy and efficiency of the method by calculating the RSET in sub-extremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. We find numerical evidence for the regularity of the RSET at the extremal horizon regardless of the field mass and its coupling. We employ our numerical results of the RSET to source the semi-classical Einstein equations, demonstrating that if the RSET is considered as a static perturbation, it will either de-extremalize the black hole, or convert it into a horizonless object.</description>

      <title>On a Solution to the Dirac Equation with a Triangular Potential Well</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral anomalies resulting from the breaking of classical symmetries at the quantum level are fundamental to quantum field theory and gaining ever-growing importance in the description of topological materials in condensed matter physics. Here we present analytical solutions of the Dirac equation for massless 3+1 fermions confined to an infinite stripe and placed into a background gauge field forming a triangular potential well across the width of the stripe. Such an effective 1+1 system hosts zero-energy modes resulting in the gauge field-dependent chiral anomaly structure. This problem has a direct relation to a half-bearded graphene nanoribbon placed into an in-plane external electric field and offers it an exact solution in terms of new special functions that are similar but not reducible to Airy functions.</description>

      <title>Bipolar Fabry-P\'erot charge interferometer in periodically electron-irradiated graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron optics deals with the wave-nature of charge carriers to induce, investigate and exploit coherent phenomena in solid state devices, in analogy with optics and photonics. Typically, these goals are achieved in complex electronic devices taking advantage of the macroscopically coherent charge transport in two dimensional electron gases and superconductors. Here, we demonstrate a simple counterintuitive architecture employing intentionally-created lattice defects to induce collective coherent effects in the charge transport of graphene. More specifically, multiple Fabry-P\'erot cavities are produced by irradiating graphene via low-energy electron-beam to form periodically alternated defective and pristine nano-stripes. The enhanced hole-doping in the defective stripes creates potential barriers behaving as partially reflecting mirrors and resonantly confining the carrier-waves within the pristine areas. The interference effects are both theoretically and experimentally investigated and manifest as sheet resistance oscillations up to 30 K for both polarities of charge carriers, contrarily to traditional electrostatically-created Fabry-P\'erot interferometers. Our findings propose defective graphene as an original platform for the realization of innovative coherent electronic devices with applications in nano and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Floquet dynamical chiral spin liquid at finite frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Chern Insulators. Their realizations on ultracold-atom or Rydberg-atom platforms remain very challenging. Recently, a setup of time-periodic modulations of nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings applied on an initial genuine spin liquid state on the square lattice has been proposed to stabilize a (Abelian) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ CSL phase. In the high-frequency limit, it was shown that time evolution can be described in terms of a static effective chiral Hamiltonian. Here we revisit this proposal and consider drives at lower frequency in a regime where the high-frequency Magnus expansion fails. We show that a Dynamical CSL (DCSL) is nevertheless stabilized in a finite range of frequency. The topological nature of this dynamical phase, as well as its instability below a critical frequency, is connected to specific features of the Floquet pseudo-energy spectrum. We also show that the DCSL can be represented faithfully by a two-dimensional time-periodic tensor network and, as in the static case, topological order is associated to a tensor gauge symmetry ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ in that case).</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Spin-Imbalanced Fermi Gases with SU(N) Symmetric Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases has been extensively studied through various aspects such as Pauli blocking effects, collective modes, BCS superfluidity, and more. Despite this, multi-component fermions with imbalanced spin configurations remain largely unexplored, particularly beyond the two-component scenario. In this work, we generalize the thermodynamic study of SU($N$) fermions to spin-imbalanced configurations based on density fluctuations. Theoretically, we provide closed-form expressions of density fluctuation across all temperature ranges for general spin population setups. Experimentally, after calibrating the measurements with deeply degenerate $^{173}$Yb Fermi gases under spin-balanced configurations ($N\leq$~6), we examine the density fluctuations in spin-imbalanced systems. Specifically, we investigate two-species and four-species configurations to validate our theoretical predictions. Our analysis indicates that interaction enhancement effects can be significant even in highly spin-imbalanced systems. Finally, as an application, we use this approach to examine the decoherence process. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic features of spin-imbalanced multi-component Fermi gases and opens new avenues for exploring complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent interaction-induced topology in Bose-Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum many-body dynamics of bosonic atoms hopping in a two-leg ladder with strong on-site contact interactions. We observe that when the atoms are prepared in a staggered pattern with pairs of atoms on every other rung, singlon defects, i.e.~rungs with only one atom, can localize due to an emergent topological model, even though the underlying model in the absence of interactions admits only topologically trivial states. This emergent topological localization results from the formation of a zero-energy edge mode in an effective lattice formed by two adjacent chains with alternating strong and weak hoping links (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains) and opposite staggering which interface at the defect position. Our findings open the opportunity to dynamically generate non-trivial topological behaviors without the need for complex Hamiltonian engineering.</description>

      <title>Extended Generalized Uncertainty Principles, Liouville theorem and density of states: Snyder-De Sitter and Yang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modifications in quantum mechanical phase space lead to changes in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, these can result in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) or the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), which introduce quantum gravitational effects at small and large distances, respectively. A combination of GUP and EUP, the Extended Generalized Uncertainty Principle (EGUP or GEUP), further generalizes these modifications by incorporating noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta. This paper examines the impact of EGUP on the Liouville theorem in statistical physics and density of states within non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework. We find a weighted invariant phase space volume element in the cases of Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models, presenting how EGUP alters the density of states, potentially affecting physical (thermodynamical) properties.</description>

      <title>Photon Antibunching in Single-Molecule Vibrational Sum-Frequency Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) allows for coherent upconversion of an electromagnetic signal and has applications in mid-infrared vibrational spectroscopy of molecules. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that plasmonic nanocavities, with their deep sub-wavelength mode volumes, may allow to obtain vibrational SFG signals from a single molecule. In this article, we compute the degree of second order coherence ($g^{(2)}(0)$) of the upconverted mid-infrared field under realistic parameters and accounting for the anharmonic potential that characterizes vibrational modes of individual molecules. On the one hand, we delineate the regime in which the device should operate in order to preserve the second-order coherence of the mid-infrared source, as required in quantum applications. On the other hand, we show that an anharmonic molecular potential can lead to antibunching of the upconverted photons under coherent, Poisson-distributed mid-infrared and visible drives. Our results therefore open a path toward a new kind of bright and tunable source of indistinguishable single photons by leveraging ``vibrational blockade'' in a resonantly and parametrically driven molecule, without the need for strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quasiparticle Relaxation in a Superconductor via the Proximity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle relaxation in pure superconductors is thought to be determined by the intrinsic inelastic scattering rate in the material. In certain applications, i.e. superconducting qubits and circuits, excess quasiparticles exist at densities far beyond the thermal equilibrium level, potentially leading to dephasing and energy loss. In order to engineer superconductors with shorter overall quasiparticle lifetimes, we consider the impact of a proximity layer on the transport of quasiparticles in a superconductor. We find that a normal metal layer can be used to significantly increase the relaxation rate of quasiparticles in a superconductor, as seen by a large reduction in the quasiparticle charge imbalance in a fully proximitized Cu/Al bilayer wire. The mechanism for this effect may be useful for preventing quasiparticle poisoning of qubits using carefully chosen proximity bilayers consisting of clean superconductors and disordered normal metals.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic self-trapping in the dynamical tunneling of a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bose-Einstein condensate in a modulated, one-dimensional, anharmonic potential can exhibit dynamical tunneling between islands of regular motion in phase space. With increasingly repulsive atomic interactions, dynamical tunneling is predicted to cease due to self-trapping [S. W\"uster et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 080401 (2012)]. This suppression of tunneling oscillations is related to the same phenomenon that occurs in the two-mode dynamics of a repulsively interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential. Here we present a two-mode model for dynamical tunnelling based on nonlinear Floquet states and examine the range of validity of the approximation. We characterise nonlinear dynamical tunneling for different trap strengths, modulation amplitudes, and effective Planck constants. Using the linear Floquet states we derive an expression for the critical nonlinearity beyond which tunneling ceases. Finally we demonstrate the dynamical instability of selected nonlinear Floquet states and show how to initialise some Floquet states in experiments. Our detailed survey will enable experiments to target accessible parameter regimes for the study of nonlinear dynamical tunneling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying Yang-Baxter operators is an essential first step in the study of the simulation of integrable quantum systems on quantum computers. One of the earliest initiatives was taken by Hietarinta in classifying constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). He obtained 11 families of invertible solutions, including the one generated by the permutation operator. While these methods work well for 4 by 4 solutions, they become cumbersome for higher dimensional representations. In this work, we overcome this restriction by constructing the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent manner by using ans\"{a}tze from algebraic structures. We use four different algebraic structures that reproduce 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families when the qubit representation is chosen. The methods include a set of commuting operators, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and partition algebras. We do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class with these methods.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of boundary criticality and exotic topological semimetals in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently found that, going beyond the tendfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and violating the bulk-boundary correspondence of the usual topological phases, PT-invariant systems support a real Chern insulator with the so-called boundary criticality, which forbids the transition between different orders of topological phases accompanied by the closing and reopening of the bulk-band gap. Here, we fnd that the periodic driving can break the boundary criticality of a PT-invariant system. Setting free from the the boundary criticality, diverse first- and second-order topological phases absent in the static case are found in both the zero and Pi/T modes. The application of our result in the three-dimensional PT-invariant system permits us to discover exotic second-order Dirac and nodal-line semimetals with coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. Enriching the family of the topological phases in PT-invariant systems, our result provides us a useful way to explore novel topological phases.</description>

We use continued function such as continued exponential to converge divergent series in perturbation approaches for energy eigenvalues of Helium, Stark effect and Zeeman effect on Hydrogen. We observe that convergence properties are obtained similar to that of the Pad\'e approximation which is extensively used in literature. Free parameters are not used which influence the convergence and only first few terms in the perturbation series are implemented.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a cavity-based detection scheme for a cold atomic ensemble with a radiatively open transition. Our method exploits the collective strong coupling of atoms to the cavity mode, which results in off-resonant probing of the atomic ensemble, leading to a dramatic reduction in losses from the detection cycle. We then show the viability of this frequency measurement for detecting a small number of atoms and molecules by theoretical modelling. Compared with the most commonly used fluorescence method, we show that the cavity-based scheme allows rapid and prolonged detection of the system's evolution with minimal destruction.</description>

      <title>Generalized Abel-Plana formula as a renormalization tool in quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory the vacuum expectation values of physical observables, bilinear in the field operator, diverge. Among the most important points in the investigations of those expectation values is the regularization of divergent expressions, separation of divergences and the renormalization. In problems with boundaries the expectation values are expressed in the form of the difference of the divergent series and the corresponding integral. In problems with planar boundaries a finite integral representation for that difference is provided by the Abel-Plana summation formula. In the present contribution we consider the generalization of the Abel-Plana formula that allows to obtain similar representations for more general classes of series where the summation goes over the zeros of a given function. Applications are discussed in quantum field theoretical problems with nontrivial spatial topology and curved boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers, which are point defects in crystals, play a crucial role in altering the optical properties of their host materials, enabling widespread applications in the field of quantum information processing. While the majority of the state-of-the-art color centers are inorganic, they come with limitations such as the challenging material preparations and insufficient amount of available centers. In contrast, organic color centers have recently gained attention due to their ease of preparations and tailorable functionalities. Here, pentacene-doped p-terphenyl (Pc:Ptp), an organic color-center system normally used for microwave quantum electronics, is demonstrated for the first time its ability of self-cavity laser emission at room temperature. The laser emission is characterized by strong polarization and high anisotropy, attributed to the unique packing of the color-center molecules within the crystal. The optical coherence is found to be a figure of merit to distinguish the processes of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and lasing in Pc:Ptp.

      <title>Ramsey-Borde Atom Interferometry with a Thermal Strontium Beam for a Compact Optical Clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact optical atomic clocks have become increasingly important in field applications and clock networks. Systems based on Ramsey-Borde interferometry (RBI) with a thermal atomic beam seem promising to fill a technology gap in optical atomic clocks, as they offer higher stability than optical vapour cell clocks while being less complex than cold atomic clocks. Here, we demonstrate RBI with strontium atoms, utilizing the narrow 1S0 -&gt; 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm, yielding a 60 kHz broad spectral feature. The obtained Ramsey fringes for varying laser power are analyzed and compared with a numerical model. The 1S0 -&gt; 1P1 transition at 461 nm is used for fluorescence detection. Analyzing the slope of the RBI signal and the fluorescence detection noise yields an estimated short-term stability of 4x10-14 / sqrt{tau}. We present our experimental setup in detail, including the atomic beam source, frequency-modulation spectroscopy to lock the 461 nm laser, laser power stabilization and the high-finesse cavity pre-stabilization of the 689 nm laser. Our system serves as a ground testbed for future clock systems in mobile and space applications.</description>

      <title>Simulating Chemistry with Fermionic Optical Superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum number preserving Ans\"atze for variational optimization in quantum chemistry find an elegant mapping to ultracold fermions in optical superlattices. Using native Hubbard dynamics, trial ground states for arbitrary molecular Hamiltonians can be prepared and their molecular energies measured in the lattice. The scheme requires local control over interactions and chemical potentials and global control over tunneling dynamics, but foregoes the need for optical tweezers, shuttling operations, or long-range interactions. We describe a complete compilation pipeline from the molecular Hamiltonian to the sequence of lattice operations, thus providing a concrete link between quantum simulation and chemistry. Our work enables the application of recent quantum algorithmic techniques, such as Double Factorization and quantum Tailored Coupled Cluster, to present-day fermionic optical lattice systems with significant improvements in the required number of experimental repetitions. We provide detailed quantum resource estimates for small non-trivial hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>Iteration Complexity of Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in near-term applications of quantum computers, i.e., using quantum circuits that have short decoherence times due to hardware limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQA), wherein an optimization algorithm implemented on a classical computer evaluates a parametrized quantum circuit as an objective function, are a leading framework in this space. An enormous breadth of algorithms in this framework have been proposed for solving a range of problems in machine learning, forecasting, applied physics, and combinatorial optimization, among others.
  In this paper, we analyze the iteration complexity of VQA, that is, the number of steps that VQA requires until its iterates satisfy a surrogate measure of optimality. We argue that although VQA procedures incorporate algorithms that can, in the idealized case, be modeled as classic procedures in the optimization literature, the particular nature of noise in near-term devices invalidates the claim of applicability of off-the-shelf analyses of these algorithms. Specifically, noise makes the evaluations of the objective function via quantum circuits biased. Commonly used optimization procedures, such as SPSA and the parameter shift rule, can thus be seen as derivative-free optimization algorithms with biased function evaluations, for which there are currently no iteration complexity guarantees in the literature. We derive the missing guarantees and find that the rate of convergence is unaffected. However, the level of bias contributes unfavorably to both the constant therein, and the asymptotic distance to stationarity, i.e., the more bias, the farther one is guaranteed, at best, to reach a stationary point of the VQA objective.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Routing Based on Fidelity Curves</title>

Abstract: How to efficiently distribute entanglement over large-scale quantum networks is still an open problem that greatly depends on the technology considered. In this work, we consider quantum networks where each link is characterized by a trade-off between the entanglement generation rate and fidelity. For such networks, we look at the two following problems: the one of finding the best path to connect any two given nodes, and the problem of finding the best starting node in order to connect three nodes in the network multipartite entanglement routing. Two entanglement distribution models are considered: one where entangled qubits are distributed one at a time, and a flow model where a large number of entangled qubits are distributed simultaneously. The paper proposes of a quite general methodology that uses continuous fidelity curves (i.e., entanglement generation fidelity vs. rate) as the main routing metric. Combined with multi-objective path-finding algorithms, the fidelity curves describing each link allow finding a set of paths that maximize both the end-to-end fidelity and the entanglement generation rate. For the link models and networks considered, it is proven that the algorithm always converges to the optimal solution. It is also shown through simulation that the execution time grows polynomially with the number of network nodes (growing with a power between $1$ and $1.4$, depending on the network)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality and uncertainty relations are distinct features of quantum theory from classical physics. Bell nonlocality concerns the correlation strength among local observables on different quantum particles, whereas the uncertainty relations set the lower bound of the sum or product of the variance square of observables. Here we establish the statistical link between these two quantum characters using the Aharonov-Vaidman identity. Therein, the upper bounds of Bell-type inequalities are expressed in terms of the product of the local sum of the variance square. On the other hand, instead of evaluating local uncertainty relations, the uncertainty relations on two or more quantum systems are upper-bounded by the amount of Bell nonlocality therein.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Quantum Particle Statistics: Bosons, Fermions, and Transtatistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identical quantum particles exhibit only two types of statistics: bosonic and fermionic. Theoretically, this restriction is commonly established through the symmetrization postulate or (anti)commutation constraints imposed on the algebra of creation and annihilation operators. The physical motivation for these axioms remains poorly understood, leading to various generalizations by modifying the mathematical formalism in somewhat arbitrary ways. In this work, we take an opposing route and classify quantum particle statistics based on operationally well-motivated assumptions. Specifically, we consider that a) the standard (complex) unitary dynamics defines the set of single-particle transformations, and b) phase transformations act locally in the space of multi-particle systems. We develop a complete characterization, which includes bosons and fermions as basic statistics with minimal symmetry. Interestingly, we have discovered whole families of novel statistics (dubbed transtatistics) accompanied by hidden symmetries, generic degeneracy of ground states, and spontaneous symmetry breaking -- effects that are (typically) absent in ordinary statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect refers to the accumulation of eigenstates near the boundary in open boundary lattice models, which can be systematically characterized using the non-Bloch band theory. Here, we apply the non-Bloch band theory to investigate the stochastic reaction-diffusion process by mapping it to a non-Hermitian Kitaev chain. We exactly obtain the open boundary spectrum and the generalized Brillouin zone, and identify a robust zero mode arising from the non-Bloch topology. Notably, distinct from its Hermitian counterpart in the quantum context, the zero mode supports anomalous dynamical crossover in the Markov process. We quantitatively demonstrate the intriguing dynamical effects through the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian on the non-Bloch eigenstates, and confirm our findings by conducting stochastic simulations with high accuracy. Our study highlights the significant and general role of non-Bloch topology in non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Atom and matter interferometers are precise quantum sensing experiments that can probe differential forces along separated spacetime paths. Various atom and matter interferometer experiments have been proposed to study dark matter, gravitational waves, and exotic new physics. Increasingly, these experimental concepts have proposed space-based designs to maximize interrogation times and baselines. However, decoherence and phase shifts caused by astrophysical backgrounds could largely undermine or destroy the target sensitivity of the experiments. We calculate the decoherence effects induced by solar photons, the solar wind, cosmic rays, solar neutrinos and zodiacal dust on space-based atom and matter interferometers. We find that, in future space-based atom and matter interferometers, the solar wind generically produces decoherence beyond the quantum noise limit, without proper shielding. In addition, solar photons are also an important background for matter interferometers.</description>

      <title>One-Time Compilation of Device-Level Instructions for Quantum Subroutines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large class of problems in the current era of quantum devices involve interfacing between the quantum and classical system. These include calibration procedures, characterization routines, and variational algorithms. The control in these routines iteratively switches between the classical and the quantum computer. This results in the repeated compilation of the program that runs on the quantum system, scaling directly with the number of circuits and iterations. The repeated compilation results in a significant overhead throughout the routine. In practice, the total runtime of the program (classical compilation plus quantum execution) has an additional cost proportional to the circuit count. At practical scales, this can dominate the round-trip CPU-QPU time, between 5% and 80%, depending on the proportion of quantum execution time.
  To avoid repeated device-level compilation, we identify that machine code can be parametrized corresponding to pulse/gate parameters which can be dynamically adjusted during execution. Therefore, we develop a device-level partial-compilation (DLPC) technique that reduces compilation overhead to nearly constant, by using cheap remote procedure calls (RPC) from the QPU control software to the CPU. We then demonstrate the performance speedup of this on optimal pulse calibration, system characterization using randomized benchmarking (RB), and variational algorithms. We execute this modified pipeline on real trapped-ion quantum computers and observe significant reductions in compilation time, as much as 2.7x speedup for small-scale VQE problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear boolean equation systems play an important role in a wide range of applications. Grover's algorithm is one of the best-known quantum search algorithms in solving the nonlinear boolean equation system on quantum computers. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques to improve the efficiency under Grover's algorithm framework. A W-cycle circuit construction introduces a recursive idea to increase the solvable number of boolean equations given a fixed number of qubits. Then, a greedy compression technique is proposed to reduce the oracle circuit depth. Finally, a randomized Grover's algorithm randomly chooses a subset of equations to form a random oracle every iteration, which further reduces the circuit depth and the number of ancilla qubits. Numerical results on boolean quadratic equations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic photon sources allow long-term advancements in quantum optics. A single quantum emitter embedded in a photonic resonator or waveguide may be triggered to emit one photon at a time into a desired optical mode. By coherently controlling a single spin in the emitter, multi-photon entanglement can be realized. We demonstrate a deterministic source of three-qubit entanglement based on a single electron spin trapped in a quantum dot embedded in a planar nanophotonic waveguide. We implement nuclear spin narrowing to increase the spin dephasing time to $T_2^* \simeq 33$ ns, which enables high-fidelity coherent optical spin rotations, and realize a spin-echo pulse sequence for sequential generation of high-fidelity spin-photon and spin-photon-photon entanglement. The emitted photons are highly indistinguishable, which is a key requirement for subsequent photon fusions to realize larger entangled states. This work presents a scalable deterministic source of multi-photon entanglement with a clear pathway for further improvements, offering promising applications in photonic quantum computing or quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the analysis of optical quantum systems using the Koopman operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prediction of photon echoes is a crucial technique for understanding optical quantum systems. However, it typically requires numerous simulations with varying parameters and input pulses, rendering numerical studies computationally expensive. This article investigates the use of data-driven surrogate models based on the Koopman operator to accelerate this process while maintaining accuracy over many time steps. To this end, we employ a bilinear Koopman model using extended dynamic mode decomposition to simulate the optical Bloch equations for an ensemble of inhomogeneously broadened two-level systems. These systems are well suited to describe the excitation of excitonic resonances in semiconductor nanostructures, such as ensembles of semiconductor quantum dots. We conduct a detailed study to determine the number of system simulations required for the resulting data-driven Koopman model to achieve sufficient accuracy across a wide range of parameter settings. We analyze the L2 error and the relative error of the photon echo peak and investigate how the control positions relate to stabilization. After proper training, our methods can predict the dynamics of the quantum ensemble accurately and with numerical efficiency.</description>

      <title>Handbook for Quantifying Robustness of Magic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01362v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonstabilizerness, or magic, is an essential quantum resource to perform universal quantum computation. Robustness of magic (RoM) in particular characterizes the degree of usefulness of a given quantum state for non-Clifford operation. While the mathematical formalism of RoM can be given in a concise manner, it is extremely challenging to determine the RoM in practice, since it involves superexponentially many pure stabilizer states. In this work, we present efficient novel algorithms to compute the RoM. The crucial technique is a subroutine that achieves the remarkable features in calculation of overlaps between pure stabilizer states: (i) the time complexity per each stabilizer is reduced exponentially, (ii) the space complexity is reduced superexponentially. Based on this subroutine, we present algorithms to compute the RoM for arbitrary states up to $n=7$ qubits on a laptop, while brute-force methods require a memory size of 86 TiB. As a byproduct, the proposed subroutine allows us to simulate the stabilizer fidelity up to $n=8$ qubits, for which naive methods require memory size of 86 PiB so that any state-of-the-art classical computer cannot execute the computation. We further propose novel algorithms that utilize the preknowledge on the structure of target quantum state such as the permutation symmetry of disentanglement, and numerically demonstrate our state-of-the-art results for copies of magic states and partially disentangled quantum states. The series of algorithms constitute a comprehensive ``handbook'' to scale up the computation of the RoM, and we envision that the proposed technique applies to the computation of other quantum resource measures as well.</description>

      <title>End-to-end complexity for simulating the Schwinger model on quantum computers</title>

Abstract: The Schwinger model is one of the simplest gauge theories. It is known that a topological term of the model leads to the infamous sign problem in the classical Monte Carlo method. In contrast to this, recently, quantum computing in Hamiltonian formalism has gained attention. In this work, we estimate the resources needed for quantum computers to compute physical quantities that are challenging to compute on classical computers. Specifically, we propose an efficient implementation of block-encoding of the Schwinger model Hamiltonian. Considering the structure of the Hamiltonian, this block-encoding with a normalization factor of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ can be implemented using $\mathcal{O}(N+\log^2(N/\varepsilon))$ T gates. As an end-to-end application, we compute the vacuum persistence amplitude. As a result, we found that for a system size $N=128$ and an additive error $\varepsilon=0.01$, with an evolution time $t$ and a lattice spacing a satisfying $t/2a=10$, the vacuum persistence amplitude can be calculated using about $10^{13}$ T gates. Our results provide insights into predictions about the performance of quantum computers in the FTQC and early FTQC era, clarifying the challenges in solving meaningful problems within a realistic timeframe.</description>

      <title>Telling different unravelings apart via nonlinear quantum-trajectory averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation (ME) governs the density matrix of open quantum systems (OQSs). When an OQS is subjected to weak continuous measurement, its state evolves as a stochastic quantum trajectory, whose statistical average solves the ME. The ensemble of such trajectories is termed an unraveling of the ME. We propose a method to operationally distinguish unravelings produced by the same ME in different measurement scenarios, using nonlinear averages of observables over trajectories. We apply the method to the paradigmatic quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence in a two-level atom. We compare the Poisson-type unraveling, induced by direct detection of photons scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type unraveling, induced by phase-sensitive detection of the emitted field. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged variance is able to distinguish these measurement scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the method, which can be readily extended to more complex OQSs, under a range of realistic experimental conditions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional membrane-in-the-middle model for a cavity that consists of two fixed, perfect mirrors and a mobile dielectric membrane between them that has a constant electric susceptibility. We present a sequence of exact cavity angular frequencies that we call structural angular frequencies and that have the remarkable property that they are independent of the position of the membrane inside the cavity. Furthermore, the case of a thin membrane is considered and simple, approximate formulae for the angular frequencies and for the modes of the cavity are obtained. Finally, the cavity electromagnetic potential is numerically calculated and it is found that the potential is accurately described by a multiple scales solution.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers exhibit an inherent randomness, so it seems natural to consider them for procedural content generation. In this work, a quantum version of the famous (classical) wave function collapse algorithm is proposed. This quantum wave function collapse algorithm is based on the idea that a quantum circuit can be prepared in such a way that it acts as a special-purpose random generator for content of a desired form. The proposed method is presented theoretically and investigated experimentally on simulators and IBM Quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Line Search Strategy for Navigating through Barren Plateaus in Quantum Circuit Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are viewed as promising candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage on near-term devices. These approaches typically involve the training of parameterized quantum circuits through a classical optimization loop. However, they often encounter challenges attributed to the exponentially diminishing gradient components, known as the barren plateau (BP) problem. This work introduces a novel optimization method designed to alleviate the adverse effects of BPs during circuit training. Our approach to select the optimization search direction relies on the distant features of the cost-function landscape. This enables the optimization path to navigate around barren plateaus without the need for external control mechanisms. We have successfully applied our optimization strategy to quantum circuits comprising $16$ qubits and $15000$ entangling gates, demonstrating robust resistance against BPs. Additionally, we have extended our optimization strategy by incorporating an evolutionary selection framework, enhancing its ability to avoid local minima in the landscape. The modified algorithm has been successfully utilized in quantum gate synthesis applications, showcasing a significantly improved efficiency in generating highly compressed quantum circuits compared to traditional gradient-based optimization approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms frequently rely on truncated series approximations, which typically require high truncation orders for adequate accuracy, leading to impractical circuit complexity. In response, we introduce Randomized Truncated Series (RTS), a framework that significantly reduces circuit depth by quadratically improving truncation error and enabling continuous adjustment of the effective truncation order. RTS leverages random mixing of series expansions to achieve these enhancements. We generalize the mixing lemma to near-unitary instances to support our error analysis and demonstrate the versatility of RTS through applications in linear combinations of unitaries, quantum signal processing, and quantum differential equations. Our results shed light on the path toward practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations for extremely large-scale systems within a feasible computation time serves in accelerating engineering developments. Quantum computing algorithms, particularly the Hamiltonian simulations, present a potential and promising approach to achieve this purpose. Actually, there are several oracle-based Hamiltonian simulations with potential quantum speedup, but their detailed implementations and accordingly the detailed computational complexities are all unclear. This paper presents a method that enables us to explicitly implement the quantum circuit for Hamiltonian simulation; the key technique is the explicit gate construction of differential operators contained in the target partial differential equation discretized by the finite difference method. Moreover, we show that the space and time complexities of the constructed circuit are exponentially smaller than those of conventional classical algorithms. We also provide numerical experiments and an experiment on a real device for the wave equation to demonstrate the validity of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear effect of magnetic field on the build-up of condensated quantum well exciton-polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the nonlinear effects of a magnetic field on the relaxation process of exciton-polaritons toward Bose-Einstein condensation in GaAs quantum wells. Our study reveals that the modification of the exciton's effective mass, Rabi splitting, and dispersion significantly alters the relaxation rate of polaritons as they approach condensation. By employing a quasi-stationary pump, we clarify the dynamics of the total and condensed polariton populations in response to varying magnetic field strengths. Notably, we demonstrate that under low-energy pumping conditions, the presence of a magnetic field significantly suppresses condensation. This suppression is attributed to the decreased scattering rate between energy levels, which is a consequence of the reduced steepness in the high-energy dispersion. Conversely, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field can enhance relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems, the entanglement of a region $A$ can be described in terms of the surface tension of a spacetime membrane pinned to the boundary of $A$. Here, we interpret the tension of this entanglement membrane in terms of the rate at which information "flows" across it. For any orientation of the membrane, one can define (generically nonunitary) dynamics across the membrane; we explore this dynamics in various space-time translation-invariant (STTI) stabilizer circuits in one and two spatial dimensions. We find that the flux of information across the membrane in these STTI circuits reaches a steady state. In the cases where this dynamics is nonunitary and the steady state flux is nonzero, this occurs because the dynamics across the membrane is unitary in a subspace of extensive entropy. This generalized unitarity is present in a broad class of STTI stabilizer circuits, and is also present in some special non-stabilizer models. The existence of multiple unitary (or generalized unitary) directions forces the entanglement membrane tension to be a piecewise linear function of the orientation of the membrane; in this respect, the entanglement membrane behaves like an interface in a zero-temperature classical lattice model. We argue that entanglement membranes in random stabilizer circuits that produce volume-law entanglement are also effectively at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity is a prototypical example of a non-trivial open quantum system. Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unravelling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the inter detection times. Furthermore, by comparing single and multi-photon scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce fermionic machine learning (FermiML), a machine learning framework based on fermionic quantum computation. FermiML models are expressed in terms of parameterized matchgate circuits, a restricted class of quantum circuits that map exactly to systems of free Majorana fermions. The FermiML framework allows for building fermionic counterparts of any quantum machine learning (QML) model based on parameterized quantum circuits, including models that produce highly entangled quantum states. Importantly, matchgate circuits are efficiently simulable classically, thus rendering FermiML a flexible framework for utility benchmarks of QML methods on large real-world datasets. We initiate the exploration of FermiML by benchmarking it against unrestricted PQCs in the context of classification with random quantum kernels. Through experiments on standard datasets (Digits and Wisconsin Breast Cancer), we demonstrate that FermiML kernels are on-par with unrestricted PQC kernels in classification tasks using support-vector machines. Furthermore, we find that FermiML kernels outperform their unrestricted candidates on multi-class classification, including on datasets with several tens of relevant features. We thus show how FermiML enables us to explore regimes previously inaccessible to QML methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00873v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>

Abstract: The potential of employing higher orders of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the evolution operator for more effective simulations of quantum systems on a noisy quantum computer is explored. By examining the transverse-field Ising model and the XY model, it is demonstrated that when the gate error is decreased by approximately an order of magnitude relative to typical modern values, higher-order Trotterization becomes advantageous. This form of Trotterization yields a global minimum of the overall simulation error, comprising both the mathematical error of Trotterization and the physical error arising from gate execution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a chaotic particle-conserving kinetically constrained model, with a single parameter which allows us to break reflection symmetry. Through extensive numerical simulations we find that the domain wall state shows a variety of dynamical behaviors from localization all the way to ballistic transport, depending on the value of the reflection breaking parameter. Surprisingly, such anomalous behavior is not mirrored in infinite-temperature dynamics, which appear to scale diffusively, in line with expectations for generic interacting models. However, studying the particle density gradient, we show that the lack of reflection symmetry affects infinite-temperature dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric dynamical structure factor. This is in disagreement with normal diffusion and suggests that the model may also exhibit anomalous dynamics at infinite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we observe low-entangled eigenstates in the spectrum of the model, a telltale sign of quantum many body scars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropic dynamics of a multiqubit cavity quantum electrodynamics system is simulated and various aspects of entropy are explored. In the modified version of the Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard model, atoms are held in optical cavities through optical tweezers and can jump between different cavities through the tunneling effect. The interaction of atom with the cavity results in different electronic transitions and the creation and annihilation of corresponding types of photon. Electron spin and the Pauli exclusion principle are considered. Formation and break of covalent bond and creation and annihilation of phonon are also introduced into the model. The system is bipartite. The effect of all kinds of interactions on entropy is studied. And the von Neumann entropy of different subsystems is compared. The results show that the entropic dynamics can be controlled by selectively choosing system parameters, and the entropy values of different subsystems satisfy certain inequality relationships.</description>

Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature Rydberg arrays: quantum phases and entanglement characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the most prominent platforms for analog quantum simulators, Rydberg atom arrays are a promising tool for exploring quantum phases and transitions. While the ground state properties of one-dimensional Rydberg systems are already thoroughly examined, we extend the analysis towards the finite-temperature scenario. For this purpose, we develop a tensor network-based numerical toolbox for constructing the quantum many-body states at thermal equilibrium, which we exploit to probe classical correlations as well as entanglement monotones. We clearly observe ordered phases continuously shrinking due to thermal fluctuations at finite system sizes. Moreover, by examining the entanglement of formation and entanglement negativity of a half-system bipartition, we numerically confirm that a conformal scaling law of entanglement extends from the zero-temperature critical points into the low-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Fate of non-Hermitian free fermions with Wannier-Stark ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark localization dynamically alters the entanglement behavior of non-Hermitian free fermions. Utilizing the single-particle correlation matrix technique, we analyze the effective Hamiltonian of these fermions with a Wannier-Stark ladder. Under open boundary conditions, we observe the steady state half-chain entanglement entropy and identify two distinct area law regions and an algebraic scaling region. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals critical scaling behavior of the half-chain entanglement entropy. Notably, the system demonstrates unique entanglement characteristics under periodic boundary conditions, which diverge from the (1+1)d conformal field theory predictions for Anderson localization. Our findings highlight novel entanglement phases emerging from the interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and disorder-free localization.</description>

      <title>On stability of k-local quantum phases of matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current theoretical framework for topological phases of matter is based on the thermodynamic limit of a system with geometrically local interactions. A natural question is to what extent the notion of a phase of matter remains well-defined if we relax the constraint of geometric locality, and replace it with a weaker graph-theoretic notion of $k$-locality. As a step towards answering this question, we analyze the stability of the energy gap to perturbations for Hamiltonians corresponding to general quantum low-density parity-check codes, extending work of Bravyi and Hastings [Commun. Math. Phys. 307, 609 (2011)]. A corollary of our main result is that if there exist constants $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2&gt;0$ such that the size $\Gamma(r)$ of balls of radius $r$ on the interaction graph satisfy $\Gamma(r) = O(\exp(r^{1-\varepsilon_1}))$ and the local ground states of balls of radius $r\le\rho^\ast = O(\log(n)^{1+\varepsilon_2})$ are locally indistinguishable, then the energy gap of the associated Hamiltonian is stable against local perturbations. This gives an almost exponential improvement over the $D$-dimensional Euclidean case, which requires $\Gamma(r) = O(r^D)$ and $\rho^\ast = O(n^\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. The approach we follow falls just short of proving stability of finite-rate qLDPC codes, which have $\varepsilon_1 = 0$; we discuss some strategies to extend the result to these cases. We discuss implications for the third law of thermodynamics, as $k$-local Hamiltonians can have extensive zero-temperature entropy.</description>

      <title>Characterization and thermometry of dissapatively stabilized steady states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the properties of dissipatively stabilized steady states of noisy quantum algorithms, exploring the extent to which they can be well approximated as thermal distributions, and proposing methods to extract the effective temperature T. We study an algorithm called the Relaxational Quantum Eigensolver (RQE), which is one of a family of algorithms that attempt to find ground states and balance error in noisy quantum devices. In RQE, we weakly couple a second register of auxiliary "shadow" qubits to the primary system in Trotterized evolution, thus engineering an approximate zero-temperature bath by periodically resetting the auxiliary qubits during the algorithm's runtime. Balancing the infinite temperature bath of random gate error, RQE returns states with an average energy equal to a constant fraction of the ground state. We probe the steady states of this algorithm for a range of base error rates, using several methods for estimating both T and deviations from thermal behavior. In particular, we both confirm that the steady states of these systems are often well-approximated by thermal distributions, and show that the same resources used for cooling can be adopted for thermometry, yielding a fairly reliable measure of the temperature. These methods could be readily implemented in near-term quantum hardware, and for stabilizing and probing Hamiltonians where simulating approximate thermal states is hard for classical computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of an antiferromagnetically coupled spin system, specifically \ensuremath{\text{Cu}_{3}-\text{X}}(\ensuremath{\text{X=As, Sb}}), characterized by a slightly distorted equilateral triangle configuration. Using the Heisenberg model with exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, g-factors, and an external magnetic field, we investigate three quantum machines using this system as the working substance, assuming reversible processes. The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is significant at low temperatures (around 1K) under a perpendicular magnetic field (\sim5T). We analyze how MCE influences the Carnot machine, which operates as a heat engine or refrigerator when varying the external magnetic field. In contrast, the Otto and Stirling machines can operate as heat engines, refrigerators, heaters, or thermal accelerators, depending on the magnetic field intensity. Our results indicate that enhanced MCE broadens the operating regions for these machines, with the Otto and Stirling machines primarily functioning as refrigerators and accelerators. The corresponding thermal efficiencies are also discussed for all operating modes.</description>

Abstract: We propose and analyze an approach for fast syndrome measurements in an array of rubidium and cesium atomic qubits. The scheme works by implementing an inter-species $\textsf{CNOT}_k$ gate, entangling one cesium ancilla qubit with $k\geq 1$ rubidium qubits which are then used for state measurement. Utilizing Rydberg states with different inter- and intra-species interaction strengths, the proposal provides a syndrome measurement fidelity of $\mathcal{F}&gt;0.9999$ in less than 5 $\mu$s of integration time.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a crucial technique for characterizing the state of a quantum system, which is essential for many applications in quantum technologies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging neural networks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum state tomography. Still, many of them did not include mixed quantum state, since pure states are arguably less common in practical situations. In this research paper, we present two neural networks based approach for both pure and mixed quantum state tomography: Restricted Feature Based Neural Network and Mixed States Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, evaluate its effectiveness in comparison to existing neural based methods. We demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art results in reconstructing mixed quantum states from experimental data. Our work highlights the potential of neural networks in revolutionizing quantum state tomography and facilitating the development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Fisher Matrix Results for Distributed Phases Using Multiphoton Polarization Greenberger Horne Zeilinger States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent times, distributed sensing has been extensively studied using squeezed states. While this is an excellent development, it is desirable to investigate the use of other quantum probes, such as entangled states of light. In this study, we focus on distributed sensing, i.e., estimating multiple unknown phases at different spatial nodes using multiphoton polarization-entangled Greenberger Horne Zeilinger (GHZ) states distributed across different nodes.We utilize tools of quantum metrology and calculate the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM). However, the QFIM turns out to be singular, hindering the determination of quantum Cramer-Rao bounds for the parameters of interest. Recent experiments have contended with a weaker form of the Cram\'er-Rao bound, which does not require the inversion of the QFIM. It is desirable to understand how relevant these weaker bounds are and how closely they approach the exact Cramer-Rao bounds. We thus analyze the reason for this singularity and, by removing a redundant phase, obtain a nonsingular QFIM, allowing us to derive exact quantum Cramer-Rao bounds. Using the nonsingular QFIM, we show that the arithmetic average of the distributed phases is Heisenberg-limited. We demonstrate that the quantum metrological bounds can be saturated by projective measurements, enabling us to determine the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which is also singular. We then show how this singularity can be resolved.</description>

      <title>Exactly-solved model of light-scattering errors in quantum simulations with metastable trapped-ion qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically solve a model for light scattering in Ising dynamics of metastable atomic qubits, generalizing the approach of Foss-Feig {\it et al.}~[Phys.~Rev.~A {\bf 87}, 042101 (2013)] to include leakage outside the qubit manifold. We analyze the influence of these fundamental errors in simulations of proposed experiments with metastable levels of $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. We find that ``effective magnetic fields" generated by leaked qubits have significant impacts on spin-spin correlation functions for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation or for quantum simulations with strong coupling, while spin squeezing uses a much weaker coupling and is largely insensitive to the simulated leakage errors, even with a few hundred ions. Our theory and results are expected to be useful in modeling a variety of metastable qubit experiments in the future.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Conference Key Agreement (CKA) provides a secure method for multi-party communication. A recently developed interference-based prepare-and-measure quantum CKA possesses the advantages of measurement-device-independence, namely, being immune to side-channels from the detector side. Besides, it achieves good key rate performance, especially for high-loss channels, due to the use of single photon interference. Meanwhile, several fully passive QKD schemes have been proposed, which eliminate all side channels from the source modulation side. We extend the fully passive idea to an interference-based CKA, which has a high level of implementation security for many-user communication.</description>

Abstract: State convertibility is fundamental in the study of resource theory of quantum coherence. It is aimed at identifying when it is possible to convert a given coherent state to another using only incoherent operations. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of state convertibility under genuinely incoherent operations. It is found that convexity of the robustness of coherence plays a central role. Based on this, the majorization condition of determining convertibility from pure states to mixed states under strictly incoherent operations is provided. Moreover, maximally coherent states in the set of all states with fixed diagonal elements are determined. It is somewhat surprising that convexity of the robustness of coherence can also decide conversion between off-diagonal parts of coherent states. This might be a big step to answer completely the question of state convertibility for mixed states under incoherent operations.</description>

Abstract: In the paper of F.A. Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti, L. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the trace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of elements in the $\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian states. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based on a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more straightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent, especially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend on number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with infinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful inequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to the problem leading to different results. The problem studied in this paper can be considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance distance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical probability theory.</description>

Abstract: Optical cavities can provide fast and non-destructive readout of individual atomic qubits; however, scaling up to many qubits remains a challenge. Using locally addressed excited-state Stark shifts to tune atoms out of resonance, we realize site-selective hyperfine-state cavity readout across a 10-site array. The state discrimination fidelity is 0.994(1) for one atom and 0.989(2) averaged over the entire array at a survival probability of 0.975(1). To further speed up array readout, we demonstrate adaptive search strategies utilizing global/subset checks. Finally, we demonstrate repeated rounds of classical error correction, showing exponential suppression of logical error and extending logical memory fivefold beyond the single-bit idling lifetime.</description>

Abstract: We consider the characteristic time operator $\mathsf{T}$ introduced in [E. A. Galapon, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 458:2671 (2002)] which is bounded and self-adjoint. For a semibounded discrete Hamiltonian $\mathsf{H}$ with some growth condition, $\mathsf{T}$ satisfies the canonical relation $[\mathsf{T},\mathsf{H}]|\psi\rangle=i\hbar|\psi\rangle$ for $|\psi\rangle$ in a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. While $\mathsf{T}$ is not covariant, we show that it still satisfies the canonical relation in a set of times of total measure zero called the time invariant set $\mathscr{T}$. In the neighborhood of each time $t$ in $\mathscr{T}$, $\mathsf{T}$ is still canonically conjugate to $\mathsf{H}$ and its expectation value gives the parametric time. Its two-dimensional projection saturates the time-energy uncertainty relation in the neighborhood of $\mathscr{T}$, and is proportional to the Pauli matrix $\sigma_y$. Thus, one can construct a quantum clock that tells the time in the neighborhood of $\mathscr{T}$ by measuring a compatible observable.</description>

Abstract: Although linear quantum amplification has proven essential to the processing of weak quantum signals, extracting higher-order quantum features such as correlations in principle demands nonlinear operations. However, nonlinear processing of quantum signals is often associated with non-idealities and excess noise, and absent a general framework to harness nonlinearity, such regimes are typically avoided. Here we present a framework to uncover general quantum signal processing principles of a broad class of bosonic quantum nonlinear processors (QNPs), inspired by a remarkably analogous paradigm in nature: the processing of environmental stimuli by nonlinear, noisy neural ensembles, to enable perception. Using a quantum-coherent description of a QNP monitoring a quantum signal source, we show that quantum nonlinearity can be harnessed to calculate higher-order features of an incident quantum signal, concentrating them into linearly-measurable observables, a transduction not possible using linear amplifiers. Secondly, QNPs provide coherent nonlinear control over quantum fluctuations including their own added noise, enabling noise suppression in an observable without suppressing transduced information, a paradigm that bears striking similarities to optimal neural codings that allow perception even under highly stochastic neural dynamics. Unlike the neural case, we show that QNP-engineered noise distributions can exhibit non-classical correlations, providing a new means to harness resources such as entanglement. Finally, we show that even simple QNPs in realistic measurement chains can provide enhancements of signal-to-noise ratio for practical tasks such as quantum state discrimination.

      <title>Quantum multi-row iteration algorithm for linear systems with non-square coefficient matrices</title>

Abstract: In the field of quantum linear system algorithms, quantum computing has realized exponential computational advantages over classical computing. However, the focus has been on square coefficient matrices, with few quantum algorithms addressing non-square matrices. Towards this kind of problems defined by $ Ax = b $ where $ A $$ \in\mathbb{R}^{m \times n} $, we propose a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical multi-row iteration method and provide an explicit quantum circuit based on the quantum comparator and Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM). The time complexity of our quantum multi-row iteration algorithm is $ O(K \log m) $, with $ K $ representing the number of iteration steps, which demonstrates an exponential speedup compared to the classical version. Based on the convergence of the classical multi-row iteration algorithm, we prove that our quantum algorithm converges faster than the quantum one-row iteration algorithm presented in [Phys. Rev. A, 101, 022322 (2020)]. Moreover, our algorithm places less demand on the coefficient matrix, making it suitable for solving inconsistent systems and quadratic optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: Multi-objective search means searching for any one of several objectives in an unstructured database. Grover's algorithm has quadratic acceleration in multi-objection search than classical ones. Iterated operator in Grover's algorithm is a key element and plays an important role in amplitude amplification. In this paper, we design two distributed iterated operators and therefore two new distributed Grover's algorithms are obtained with the following advantages: (1) Compared to Grover's algorithm and the modified Grover's algorithm by Long, our distributed algorithms require fewer qubits; (2) Compared to the distributed Grover's algorithm proposed by Qiu et al., one of our distributed algorithms is exact. Of course, both our distributed algorithms require quite quantum communication and involve a number of more complicated unitary operators as cost, but there still may have certain advantage of physical realizability in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description>

Abstract: The problem of efficient quantum state learning, also called shadow tomography, aims to comprehend an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state through POVMs. Yet, these states are rarely static; they evolve due to factors such as measurements, environmental noise, or inherent Hamiltonian state transitions. This paper leverages techniques from adaptive online learning to keep pace with such state changes.
  The key metrics considered for learning in these mutable environments are enhanced notions of regret, specifically adaptive and dynamic regret. We present adaptive and dynamic regret bounds for online shadow tomography, which are polynomial in the number of qubits and sublinear in the number of measurements. To support our theoretical findings, we include numerical experiments that validate our proposed models.</description>

Abstract: The microstate of any degree of freedom of any classical dynamical system can be represented by a point in its two dimensional phase space. Since infinitely precise measurements are impossible, a measurement can, at best, constrain the location of this point to a region of phase space whose area is finite. This paper explores the implications of assuming that this finite area is bounded from below. I prove that if the same lower bound applied to every degree of freedom of a sufficiently cold classical dynamical system, the distribution of the system's energy among its degrees of freedom would be a Bose-Einstein distribution.</description>

      <title>An introduction to infinite projected entangled-pair state methods for variational ground state simulations using automatic differentiation</title>

Abstract: Tensor networks capture large classes of ground states of phases of quantum matter faithfully and efficiently. Their manipulation and contraction has remained a challenge over the years, however. For most of the history, ground state simulations of two-dimensional quantum lattice systems using (infinite) projected entangled pair states have relied on what is called a time-evolving block decimation. In recent years, multiple proposals for the variational optimization of the quantum state have been put forward, overcoming accuracy and convergence problems of previously known methods. The incorporation of automatic differentiation in tensor networks algorithms has ultimately enabled a new, flexible way for variational simulation of ground states and excited states. In this work we review the state-of-the-art of the variational iPEPS framework, providing a detailed introduction to automatic differentiation, a description of a general foundation into which various two-dimensional lattices can be conveniently incorporated, and demonstrative benchmarking results.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Being Entangled</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nielsen's approach to quantum state complexity relates the minimal number of quantum gates required to prepare a state to the length of geodesics computed with a certain norm on the manifold of unitary transformations. For a bipartite system, we investigate binding complexity, which corresponds to norms in which gates acting on a single subsystem are free of cost. We reduce the problem to the study of geodesics on the manifold of Schmidt coefficients, equipped with an appropriate metric. Binding complexity is closely related to other quantities such as distributed computing and quantum communication complexity, and has a proposed holographic dual in the context of AdS/CFT. For finite dimensional systems with a Riemannian norm, we find an exact relation between binding complexity and the minimal R\'enyi entropy. We also find analytic results for the most commonly used non-Riemannian norm (the so-called $F_1$ norm) and provide lower bounds for the associated notion of state complexity ubiquitous in quantum computation and holography. We argue that our results are valid for a large class of penalty factors assigned to generators acting across the subsystems. We demonstrate that our results can be borrowed to study the usual complexity (not-binding) for a single spin for the case of the $F_1$ norm which was previously lacking from the literature. Finally, we derive bounds for multi-partite binding complexities and the related (continuous) circuit complexity where the circuit contains at most $2$-local interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the natural isomorphism between GF(2^h) and GF(2)^h induces a bijection between stabiliser codes on n quqits with local dimension q=2^h and binary stabiliser codes on hn qubits. This allows us to describe these codes geometrically: a stabiliser code over a field of even order corresponds to a so-called quantum set of symplectic polar spaces. Moreover, equivalent stabiliser codes have a similar geometry, which can be used to prove the uniqueness of a [[4,0,3]]_4 stabiliser code and the nonexistence of both a [[7,1,4]]_4 and an [[8,0,5]]_4 stabiliser code.</description>

      <title>Preserving the Hermiticity of the One-Body Density Matrix for a Non-Interacting Fermi Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-body density matrix (ODM) for a zero temperature non-interacting Fermi gas can be approximately obtained in the semiclassical regime through different $\hbar$-expansion techniques. One would expect that each method of approximating the ODM should yield equivalent density matrices which are both Hermitian and idempotent to any order in $\hbar$. However, the Kirzhnits and Wigner-Kirkwood methods do not yield these properties, while the Grammaticos-Voros method does. Here we show explicitly, for arbitrary $d$-dimensions through an appropriate change into symmetric coordinates, that each method is indeed identical, Hermitian, and idempotent. This change of variables resolves the inconsistencies between the various methods, showing that the non-Hermitian and non-idempotent behavior of the Kirzhnits and Wigner-Kirkwood methods is an artifact of performing a non-symmetric truncation to the semiclassical $\hbar$-expansions. Our work also provides the first explicit derivation of the $d$-dimensional Grammaticos-Voros ODM, originally proposed by Redjati et al (2019 $\textit{J. Phys. Chem. Solids}$ 134 313-8) based on their $d=1,2,3,4$ expressions.</description>

Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here, we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model, an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <title>Exact Thermal Eigenstates of Nonintegrable Spin Chains at Infinite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems. Here, we write down analytically thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains. We consider a class of theoretically tractable volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These states are thermal, in the most fundamental sense that they are indistinguishable from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present a practicable interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of Fisher information offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many-particle systems with short-range interactions the local (same point) particle-particle pair correlation function represents a thermodynamic quantity that can be calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Here we exploit this property to derive a thermodynamic Maxwell relation between the local pair correlation and the entropy of an ultracold Bose gas in one dimension (1D). To demonstrate the utility of this Maxwell relation, we apply it to the computational formalism of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) to determine the entropy of a finite-temperature 1D Bose gas from its atom-atom pair correlation function. Such a correlation function is easy to compute numerically within the SPGPE and other formalisms, which is unlike computing the entropy itself. Our calculations can be viewed as a numerical experiment that serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration of an experimental method to deduce the entropy of a quantum gas from the measured atom-atom correlations.</description>

Abstract: We construct the primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of the 108-element $\Sigma(36\times3)$ group. This is the first time a nonabelian crystal-like subgroup of $SU(3)$ has been constructed for quantum simulation. The gauge link registers and necessary primitives -- the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the $\Sigma(36\times3)$ Fourier transform -- are presented for both an eight-qubit encoding and a heterogeneous three-qutrit plus two-qubit register. For the latter, a specialized compiler was developed for decomposing arbitrary unitaries onto this architecture.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in $d$-dimensional spin systems exhibiting $SO(3)$ spin rotation and lattice translation symmetries in the presence of $k-$local interactions decaying as $\sim 1/r^\alpha$ with distance $r$. Two types of Hamiltonians are considered: Type I comprises long-range spin-spin couplings, while Type II features long-range couplings between $SO(3)$ symmetric local operators. For spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems, it is shown that Type I cannot have a unique symmetric ground state with a nonzero excitation gap when the interaction decays sufficiently fast, \ie when $\alpha&gt;\max(3d,4d-2)$. For Type II, the condition becomes $\alpha&gt;\max(3d-1,4d-3)$. In $1d$, this ingappability condition is improved to $\alpha&gt;2$ for Type I and $\alpha&gt;0$ for Type II by examining the energy of a state with a uniform $2\pi$ twist. Notably, in $2d$, a Type II Hamiltonian with van der Waals interaction is subject to the constraint of the theorem.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis, in order to describe such evolution. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, we point out the exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements that determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Influence of thermal bath on Pancharatnam-Berry phase in an accelerated frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A uniformly accelerated atom captures Pancharatnam-Berry phase in its quantum state and the phase factor depends on the vacuum fluctuation of the background quantum fields. We observe that the thermal nature of the fields further affects the induced phase. Interestingly the induced phase captures the exchange symmetry between the Unruh and real thermal baths. This observation further supports the claim that the Unruh thermal bath mimics a real thermal bath. Moreover for certain values of system parameters and at high temperature, the phase is enhanced compared to zero temperature situation. However the required temperature to observe the phase experimentally is so high that the detection of Unruh effect through this is not possible within the current technology.</description>

      <title>Frequency ratio of the $^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th nuclear isomeric transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks$^{1,2}$ use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have therefore been proposed for construction of the first nuclear clock$^{3,4}$. However, quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the $^{229m}$Th isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF$_2$ host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA $^{87}$Sr clock$^2$ and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its 7th harmonic in the VUV range using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clock and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are of great importance for chemistry, physics, materials science, and many other related fields. The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions and is thus an important building block for many models of MLFFs. However, the permutation-equivariance requirement of MLFFs limits the design space of CG transform, that is, intensive CG transform has to be conducted for each neighboring edge and the operations should be performed in the same manner for all edges. This constraint results in reduced expressiveness of the model while simultaneously increasing computational demands. To overcome this challenge, we first implement the CG transform layer on the permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We show that this approach allows complete freedom in the design of the layer without compromising the crucial symmetry. Developing on this free design space, we further propose group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and is well extended to property prediction in QM9 datasets with several improvements greater than 15% and the maximum beyond 20%. The extensive real-world applications showcase high practicality. FreeCG introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs. To demonstrate this, the recent SOTA, QuinNet, is also enhanced under our paradigm. Code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for detecting mutual independence among eigenstate regimes in interacting quasiperiodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body eigenstates that are neither thermal nor many-body-localized (MBL) were numerically found in certain interacting chains with moderate quasiperiodic potentials. The energy regime consisting of these non-ergodic but extended (NEE) eigenstates has been extensively studied for being a possible many-body mobility edge between the energy-resolved MBL and thermal phases. Recently, the NEE regime was further proposed to be a prethermal phenomenon that generally occurs when different operators spread at sizably different timescales. Here, we numerically examine the mutual independence among the NEE, MBL, and thermal regimes in the lens of eigenstate entanglement spectra (ES). Given the complexity and rich information embedded in ES, we develop an unsupervised learning approach that is designed to quantify the mutual independence among general phases. Our method is first demonstrated on an illustrative toy example that uses RGB color data to represent phases, then applied to the ES of an interacting generalized Aubry Andre model from weak to strong potential strength. We find that while the MBL and thermal regimes are mutually independent, the NEE regime is dependent on the former two and smoothly appears as the potential strength decreases. We attribute our numerically finding to the fact that the ES data in the NEE regime exhibits both an MBL-like fast decay and a thermal-like long tail.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <title>Folded multistability and hidden critical point in microwave-driven Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactions between Rydberg atoms and microwave fields provide a valuable framework for studying the complex dynamics out of equilibrium, exotic phases, and critical phenomena in many-body physics. This unique interplay allows us to explore various regimes of nonlinearity and phase transitions. Here, we observe a phase transition from the state in the regime of bistability to that in multistability in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms by varying the microwave field intensity, accompanying with the breaking of Z3-symmetry. During the phase transition, the system experiences a hidden critical point, in which the multistable states are difficult to be identified. Through changing the initial state of system, we can identify a hidden multistable state and reveal a hidden trajectory of phase transition, allowing us to track to a hidden critical point. In addition, we observe multiple phase transitions in spectra, suggesting higher-order symmetry breaking. The reported results shed light on manipulating multistability in dissipative Rydberg atoms systems and hold promise in the applications of non-equilibrium many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emission from Coupled Spin Pairs in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable defect qubits in wide band gap materials are favorable candidates for room temperature quantum information processing. The two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an attractive solid state platform with a great potential for hosting bright quantum emitters with quantum memories with leveraging the potential of 2D materials for realizing scalable preparation of defect qubits. Although, room temperature bright defect qubits have been recently reported in hBN but their microscopic origin, the nature of the optical transition as well as the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) have been remained elusive. Here we connect the variance in the optical spectra, optical lifetimes and spectral stability of quantum emitters to donor-acceptor pairs (DAP) in hBN by means of ab initio calculations. We find that DAPs can exhibit ODMR signal for the acceptor counterpart of the defect pair with S=1/2 ground state at non-zero magnetic fields depending on the donor partner. The donor-acceptor pair model and its transition mechanisms provide a recipe towards defect qubit identification and performance optimization in hBN for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Digital stabilization of an IQ modulator in the carrier suppressed single side-band (CS-SSB) mode for atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an all-digital method for stabilising the phase biases in an electro-optic I/Q modulator for carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. Building on the method presented in S. Wald \ea, Appl. Opt. \textbf{62}, 1-7 (2023), we use the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 platform to digitally generate and demodulate an auxiliary radio-frequency tone whose beat with the optical carrier probes the I/Q modulator's phase imbalances. We implement a multiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for unavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at exactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase stability. We demonstrate $&gt;23\,\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier relative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\,\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours and over temperature variations of $20^\circ\rm C$.</description>

      <title>Demkov-Fradkin tensor for curved harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the Demkov-Fradkin tensor of symmetries for the quantum curved harmonic oscillator in a space with constant curvature given by a parameter $\kappa$. In order to construct this tensor we have firstly found a set of basic operators which satisfy the following conditions: i) their products give symmetries of the problem; in fact the Hamiltonian is a combination of such products; ii) they generate the space of eigenfunctions as well as the eigenvalues in an algebraic way; iii) in the limit of zero curvature, they come into the well known creation/annihilation operators of the flat oscillator. The appropriate products of such basic operators will produce the curved Demkov-Fradkin tensor. However, these basic operators do not satisfy Heisenberg commutators but close another Lie algebra. As a by-product, the classical Demkov-Fradkin tensor for the classical curved harmonic oscillator has been obtained by the same method. The case of two dimensions has been worked out in detail: the operators close a $so_\kappa(4)$ Lie algebra; the spectrum and eigenfunctions are explicitly solved in an algebraic way and in the classical case the trajectories have been computed.</description>

      <title>Planar scanning probe microscopy enables vector magnetic field imaging at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar scanning probe microscopy is a recently emerging alternative approach to tip-based scanning probe imaging. It can scan an extended planar sensor, such as a polished bulk diamond doped with magnetic-field-sensitive nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, in nanometer-scale proximity of a planar sample. So far, this technique has been limited to optical near-field microscopy, and has required nanofabrication of the sample of interest. Here we extend this technique to magnetometry using NV centers, and present a modification that removes the need for sample-side nanofabrication. We harness this new ability to perform a hitherto infeasible measurement - direct imaging of the three-dimensional vector magnetic field of magnetic vortices in a thin film magnetic heterostructure, based on repeated scanning with NV centers with different orientations within the same scanning probe. Our result opens the door to quantum sensing using multiple qubits within the same scanning probe, a prerequisite for the use of entanglement-enhanced and massively parallel schemes.</description>
