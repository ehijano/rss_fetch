      <title>DiffLiB: High-fidelity differentiable modeling of lithium-ion batteries and efficient gradient-based parameter identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, widely adopted for its precise electrochemical modeling, stands out among various simulation models of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Although the DFN model is powerful in forward predictive analysis, the inverse identification of its model parameters has remained a long-standing challenge. The numerous unknown parameters associated with the nonlinear, time-dependent, and multi-scale DFN model are extremely difficult to be determined accurately and efficiently, hindering the practical use of such battery simulation models in industrial applications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce DiffLiB, a high-fidelity finite-element-based LIB simulation framework, equipped with advanced differentiable programming techniques so that efficient gradient-based inverse parameter identification is enabled. Customized automatic differentiation rules are defined by identifying the VJP (vector-Jacobian product) structure in the chain rule and implemented using adjoint-based implicit differentiation methods. Four numerical examples, including both 2D and 3D forward predictions and inverse parameter identification, are presented to validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of DiffLiB. Benchmarking against COMSOL demonstrates excellent agreement in forward predictions, with terminal voltage discrepancies maintaining a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 2 mV across all test conditions. In parameter identification tasks using experimentally measured voltage data, the proposed gradient-based optimization scheme achieves superior computational performance, with 96% fewer forward predictions and 72% less computational time compared with gradient-free approaches. These results demonstrate that DiffLiB is a versatile and powerful computational framework for the development of advanced LIBs.</description>

      <title>Simulating Heterogeneity within Elastic and Inelastic Discrete Mechanical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates the elastic and fracture behaviors of discrete, elastically homogeneous models of heterogeneous media. The homogeneity is accomplished either by volumetric-deviatoric decomposition of constitutive function or by an auxiliary stress homogenization method. The elastic parameters of the homogenized material models are randomly varied in space to introduce heterogeneity independently of the geometric properties of the discrete model. Several forms of randomization are investigated using statistical properties of nodal stress oscillations in periodic representative volume elements (RVEs). It is found that the stress oscillations present in discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures with standard constitutive models cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions as well as dependencies between stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched.
  With respect to quasi-brittle fracture behavior, the macroscopic response of the different models is studied for the load case of uniaxial tension. The elastically homogenized material provides higher peak stress occurring at lower strain levels and a steeper softening phase, compared to the standard material. Randomization of the elastic material parameters, as well as adjustment of inelastic material parameters, brings the macroscopic response of the homogenized material close to that of the standard material, although the damage distribution prior to the strain localization differs. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled, random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models, using physically-based discretizations of material structure with standard constitutive models for comparison.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modelling of thermally stressed superelastic polyimide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many thermo-mechanical processes, such as thermal expansion and stress relaxation, originate at the atomistic scale. We develop a sequential multiscale approach to study thermally stressed superelastic polyimide to explore these effects. The continuum-scale smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model is coupled with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) through constitutive modelling, where thermo-mechanical properties and equations of state are derived from MD simulations. The results are verified through benchmark problems of heat transfer. Finally, we analyse the insulating capabilities of superelastic polyimide by simulating the thermal response of an aluminium plate. The result shows a considerable reduction in the thermal stress, strain and temperature field development in the aluminium plate when superelastic polyimide is used as an insulator. The present work demonstrates the effectiveness of the multi-scale method in capturing thermo-mechanical interactions in superelastic polyimide.</description>

      <title>Faster Random Walk-based Capacitance Extraction with Generalized Antithetic Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floating random walk-based capacitance extraction has emerged in recent years as a tried and true approach for extracting parasitic capacitance in very large scale integrated circuits. Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is dependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods are crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which is conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all extractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is complementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and its performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial such gains of up to 30% in number of walks necessary and even more in actual extraction times compared to the best previously proposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.</description>

      <title>Open FinLLM Leaderboard: Towards Financial AI Readiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial large language models (FinLLMs) with multimodal capabilities are envisioned to revolutionize applications across business, finance, accounting, and auditing. However, real-world adoption requires robust benchmarks of FinLLMs' and FinAgents' performance. Maintaining an open leaderboard is crucial for encouraging innovative adoption and improving model effectiveness. In collaboration with Linux Foundation and Hugging Face, we create an open FinLLM leaderboard, which serves as an open platform for assessing and comparing AI models' performance on a wide spectrum of financial tasks. By demoncratizing access to advances of financial knowledge and intelligence, a chatbot or agent may enhance the analytical capabilities of the general public to a professional level within a few months of usage. This open leaderboard welcomes contributions from academia, open-source community, industry, and stakeholders. In particular, we encourage contributions of new datasets, tasks, and models for continual update. Through fostering a collaborative and open ecosystem, we seek to promote financial AI readiness.</description>
