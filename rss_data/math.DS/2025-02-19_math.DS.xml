      <title>Homoclinic classes for flows: ergodicity and SRB measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we intend to study homoclinic classes for some classes of flows. To this end we obtain analogous results those obtained by Hertz-Hertz-Tahzibi-Ures in the flow setting. Namely we prove that if the Lesbegue measure gives positive measure to both stable and unstable homoclinic classes of a periodic hyperbolic orbit, then their intersection constitute an ergodic component. Futhermore, with similar techiniques we state several results concerning regular SRB measures.</description>

      <title>Ergodic optimization for beta-transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergodic optimization for beta-transformations $T_\beta(x)= \beta x \pmod 1$ is developed. If $\beta&gt;1$ is a beta-number, or such that the orbit-closure of $1$ is not minimal, we show that the Typically Periodic Optimization Conjecture holds, establishing that there exists an open dense set of H\"{o}lder continuous functions such that for each function in this set, there exists a unique maximizing measure, this measure is supported on a periodic orbit, and the periodic locking property holds. It follows that typical periodic optimization is typical among the class of beta-transformations: it holds for a set of parameters $\beta&gt;1$ that is residual, and has full Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Dry Friction Dynamics in a Vibro-Impact Energy Harvester</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibro-impact (VI) systems provide a promising nonlinear mechanism for energy harvesting (EH) in many engineering applications. Here, we consider a VI-EH system that consists of an inclined cylindrical capsule that is externally forced and a bullet that is allowed to move inside the capsule, and analyze its dynamics under the presence of dry friction. Dry friction introduces a switching manifold corresponding to zero relative velocity where the bullet sticks to the capsule, appearing as sliding in the model. We identify analytical conditions for the occurrence of non-stick and sliding motions, and construct a series of nonlinear maps that capture model solutions and their dynamics on the switching and impacting manifolds. An interplay of smooth (period-doubling) and non-smooth (grazing) bifurcations characterizes the transition from periodic solutions with alternating impacts to solutions with an additional impact on one end of the capsule per period. This transition is preceded by a sequence of grazing-sliding, switching-sliding and crossing-sliding bifurcations on the switching manifold that may reverse period doubling bifurcations for larger values of the dry friction coefficient. In general, a larger dry friction coefficient also results in larger sliding intervals, lower impact velocities yielding lower average energy outputs, and a shift in the location of some bifurcations. Surprisingly, we identify parameter regimes in which higher dry friction maintains higher energy output levels, as it shifts the location of grazing bifurcations.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Partially Hyperbolic Dichotomy: Hyperbolicity versus Nonhyperbolic Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a conservative and partially hyperbolic three-dimensional setting, we study three representative classes of diffeomorphisms: those homotopic to Anosov (or Derived from Anosov diffeomorphisms), diffeomorphisms in neighborhoods of the time-one map of the geodesic flow on a surface of negative curvature, and accessible and dynamically coherent skew products with circle fibers. In any of these classes, we establish the following dichotomy: either the diffeomorphism is Anosov, or it possesses nonhyperbolic ergodic measures. Our approach is perturbation-free and combines recent advances in the study of stably ergodic diffeomorphisms with a variation of the periodic approximation method to obtain ergodic measures.
  A key result in our construction, independent of conservative hypotheses, is the construction of nonhyperbolic ergodic measures for sets with a minimal strong unstable foliation that satisfy the mostly expanding property. This approach enables us to obtain nonhyperbolic ergodic measures in other contexts, including some subclasses of the so-called anomalous partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms that are not dynamically coherent.</description>

      <title>Density of shapes of periodic tori in the cubic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the compact orbits of the $\mathbb{R}^2$ action of the diagonal group on $\operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$, the so-called periodic tori. For any periodic torus, the set of periods of the orbit forms a lattice in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Such a lattice, re-scaled to covolume one, gives a shape point in $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$.
  We prove that the shapes of all periodic tori are dense in $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. This implies the density of shapes of the unit groups of totally real cubic orders.</description>

      <title>Continuity of Hausdorff Dimension at Hopf Bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the continuity of Hausdorff dimension and box dimension (limit capacity) of non-hyperbolic repellers of diffeomorphisms derived from transitive Anosov diffeomophisms through a Hopf bifurcation studied by Horita and Viana (see Discret. Contin. Dyn. Syst., 13 (2005), 1125-1137). Here, we extend their work showing that both dimensions are continuous at paremeter bifurcation. In the proof, we consider maps with holes introduced by Horita and Viana in Journal of Statistical Physics 105(2001), 835-862 and further developed by Dysman in Journal of Statistical Physics 120(2005),479-509, relating the Hausdorff dimension with the volume of the hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we introduce two new types of contractive mappings in perturbed metric spaces, namely $\varphi$-perturbed mappings and perturbed Kannan mappings. We prove a fixed point result for such mappings and show that our results are more general then the existing ones. We give an example to illustrate that our results are more general then the existing results and show that perturbed Kannan mappings are not necessarily continuous.</description>

      <title>On Erlang mixture approximations for differential equations with distributed time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general approach for approximate simulation and analysis of delay differential equations (DDEs) with distributed time delays based on methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The key innovation is that we 1) approximate the kernel by the probability density function of an Erlang mixture and 2) use the linear chain trick to transform the approximate DDEs to ODEs. Furthermore, we prove that an approximation with infinitely many terms converges for continuous and bounded kernels and for specific choices of the coefficients. We compare the steady states of the original DDEs and their stability criteria to those of the approximate system of ODEs, and we propose an approach based on bisection and least-squares estimation for determining optimal parameter values in the approximation. Finally, we present numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and convergence rate obtained with the optimal parameters and the efficacy of the proposed approach for bifurcation analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. The numerical examples involve a modified logistic equation and a point reactor kinetics model of a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of dynamical coverings under mixing properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we estimate the Hausdorff dimension of dynamical coverings with respect to mixing ergodic systems. More precisely, if the ergodic measure is exact-dimensionnal, we establish a formula provided that the system is polynomially fast mixing and if the measure is not exact-dimensionnal, we establish a similar result under super-polynomial speed of mix assumpetion. As an application of our result, we extend the result of Fan-Shmeling-Troubetzkoy for the doubling map on the circle to the case of the times 2, times 3 map on the two dimensional torus.</description>

      <title>Separation of time scales in weakly interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study metastable behaviour in systems of weakly interacting Brownian particles with localised, attractive potentials which are smooth and globally bounded. In this particular setting, numerical evidence suggests that the particles converge on a short time scale to a "droplet state" which is $metastable$, i.e. persists on a much longer time scale than the time scale of convergence, before eventually diffusing to $0$.
  In this article, we provide rigorous evidence and a quantitative characterisation of this separation of time scales. Working at the level of the empirical measure, we show that (after quotienting out the motion of the centre of mass) the rate of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution, which corresponds with the droplet state, is $O(1)$ as the inverse temperature $\beta \to \infty$. Meanwhile the rate of leakage away from its centre of mass is $O(e^{-\beta})$. Futhermore, the quasi-stationary distribution is localised on a length scale of order $O(\beta^{-\frac12})$. We thus provide a partial answer to a question posed by Carrillo, Craig, and Yao (Aggregation-Diffusion Equations: Dynamics, Asymptotics, and Singular Limits. In: Active Particles, Volume 2, 2019) in the microscopic setting.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Oscillation Estimates Arising in Pointwise Ergodic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish essentially optimal $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-estimates for variational variants of the maximal Fourier multiplier operators considered by Bourgain in his work on pointwise convergence of polynomial ergodic averages. We do so by addressing a simpler operator and then applying cheap interpolation methods. While elementary, these methods are strong enough to address the issue of pointwise convergence along fractional parts of real-variable polynomials in the regime $2 &lt; p \leq \infty$, namely the pointwise convergence of \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{\lfloor P(n) \rfloor} f, \; \; \; f \in L^p(X,\mu), \ P \in \mathbb{R}[\cdot] \] for any $\sigma$-finite measure space equipped with a measure-preserving transformation, $T:X \to X$.</description>

Abstract: We study the number of the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the dynamical zeta functions $\eta_N$ and $\eta_D$ for several strictly convex disjoint obstacles satisfying non-eclipse condition. We obtain a strip $\{z \in \mathbb C:\: {\rm Re}\: s &gt; \beta\}$ with infinite number of poles. For $\eta_D$ we prove the same result assuming the boundary real analytic. Moreover, for $\eta_N$ we obtain a characterisation of $\beta$ by the pressure $P(2G)$ of some function $G$ on the space $\Sigma_A^f$ related to the dynamical characteristics of the obstacle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, motivated by the study of stability of the synchronous orbit of a network with tridiagonal Laplacian matrix, we first solve an inverse eigenvalue problem which builds a tridiagonal Laplacian matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1=0&lt;\lambda_2&lt;\cdots &lt;\lambda_N$ and null-vector $\boldsymbol{e} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. Then, we show how this result can be used to guarantee -- if possible -- that a synchronous orbit of a connected tridiagonal network associated to the matrix $L$ above is asymptotically stable, in the sense of having an associated negative Master Stability Function (MSF). We further show that there are limitations when we also impose symmetry for $L$.</description>

Abstract: Bratteli diagrams with countably infinite levels exhibit a new phenomenon: they can be horizontally stationary. The incidence matrices of these horizontally stationary Bratteli diagrams are infinite banded Toeplitz matrices. In this paper, we study the fundamental properties of horizontally stationary Bratteli diagrams. In these diagrams, we provide an explicit description of ergodic tail invariant probability measures. For a certain class of horizontally stationary Bratteli diagrams, we prove that all ergodic tail invariant probability measures are extensions of measures from odometers. Additionally, we establish conditions for the existence of a continuous Vershik map on the path space of a horizontally stationary Bratteli diagram.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit an obstruction for groups with Relative Property (T) to act on the real line by bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This condition is expressed in terms of the Lipschitz and Kazhdan constants associated to finite generating subsets. As an application, we obtain an explicit lower bound for the Lipschitz constants associated to actions of the semidirect product $\mathbb{F}_2\ltimes\mathbb{Z}^2$. We also obtain an upper bound for the Kazhdan constants of pairs of orderable groups, depending only on the cardinal of the generating subset.</description>
