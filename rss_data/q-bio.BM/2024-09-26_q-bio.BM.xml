      <title>BetterBodies: Reinforcement Learning guided Diffusion for Antibody Sequence Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibodies offer great potential for the treatment of various diseases. However, the discovery of therapeutic antibodies through traditional wet lab methods is expensive and time-consuming. The use of generative models in designing antibodies therefore holds great promise, as it can reduce the time and resources required. Recently, the class of diffusion models has gained considerable traction for their ability to synthesize diverse and high-quality samples. In their basic form, however, they lack mechanisms to optimize for specific properties, such as binding affinity to an antigen. In contrast, the class of offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods has demonstrated strong performance in navigating large search spaces, including scenarios where frequent real-world interaction, such as interaction with a wet lab, is impractical. Our novel method, BetterBodies, which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with RL guided latent diffusion, is able to generate novel sets of antibody CDRH3 sequences from different data distributions. Using the Absolut! simulator, we demonstrate the improved affinity of our novel sequences to the SARS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain. Furthermore, we reflect biophysical properties in the VAE latent space using a contrastive loss and add a novel Q-function based filtering to enhance the affinity of generated sequences. In conclusion, methods such as ours have the potential to have great implications for real-world biological sequence design, where the generation of novel high-affinity binders is a cost-intensive endeavor.</description>

      <title>Predicting Distance matrix with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural prediction has long been considered critical in RNA research, especially following the success of AlphaFold2 in protein studies, which has drawn significant attention to the field. While recent advances in machine learning and data accumulation have effectively addressed many biological tasks, particularly in protein related research. RNA structure prediction remains a significant challenge due to data limitations. Obtaining RNA structural data is difficult because traditional methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Xray crystallography, and electron microscopy are expensive and time consuming. Although several RNA 3D structure prediction methods have been proposed, their accuracy is still limited. Predicting RNA structural information at another level, such as distance maps, remains highly valuable. Distance maps provide a simplified representation of spatial constraints between nucleotides, capturing essential relationships without requiring a full 3D model. This intermediate level of structural information can guide more accurate 3D modeling and is computationally less intensive, making it a useful tool for improving structural predictions. In this work, we demonstrate that using only primary sequence information, we can accurately infer the distances between RNA bases by utilizing a large pretrained RNA language model coupled with a well trained downstream transformer.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is crucial in various fields such as materials science, chemistry, and pharmacology to name a few. Conventional MD software struggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, which restricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep generative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim at learning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoying both universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods are designed solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of the underlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies and forces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditional generative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learns full-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constrained distribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate force field, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process, giving rise to enhanced simulations. Experiments on two datasets consisting of peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen systems.</description>
