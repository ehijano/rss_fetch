      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>Angular integrals with three denominators via IBP, mass reduction, dimensional shift, and differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory calculations. In this work we investigate angular integrals with three denominators in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. We derive integration-by-parts relations for this class of integrals, leading to explicit recursion relations and a reduction to a small set of master integrals. Using a differential equation approach we establish results up to order $\varepsilon$ for general integer exponents and masses. Here, reduction identities for the number of masses, known results for two-denominator integrals, and a general dimensional-shift identity for angular integrals considerably reduce the required amount of work. For the first time we find for angular integrals a term contributing proportional to a Euclidean Gram determinant in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. This coefficient is expressed as a sum of Clausen functions with intriguing connections to Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. The results of this manuscript are applicable to phase-space calculations with multiple observed final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Precise predictions for the QCD axion contribution to dark radiation with full phase-space evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the QCD axion contribution to the energy density of dark radiation, parameterized by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, by solving Boltzmann equations for the momentum distribution functions including the effects of quantum statistics for all particles involved in the axion production processes. This approach gives precise prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ independently on whether axions are produced via freeze-out or freeze-in. We focus on axions produced via flavor-conserving and flavor-violating interactions with leptons. Our precise predictions for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can differ from those assuming thermal shape for the momentum distribution functions, as commonly done in the literature, by more than the experimental precision of future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Current lower limits on the axion couplings from Planck constraints on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ are also affected by our precise computation which, in particular, results in a strongly relaxed bound on flavor-violating axion couplings to tau lepton and muon or electron.</description>

      <title>Lepton Collider as a window to Reheating: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) genesis via Ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in embeds the seed of reheating temperature and dynamics in its relic density. Thus, discovery of such a DM candidate can possibly open the window for post-inflationary dynamics. However, there are several challenges in this exercise, as freezing-in DM possesses feeble interaction with the visible sector and therefore very low production cross-section at the collider. We show that mono-photon (and dilepton) signal at the ILC, arising from DM effective operators connected to the SM field strength tensors, can still warrant a signal discovery. We study both the scalar and fermionic DM production during reheating via UV freeze-in, when the inflaton oscillates at the bottom of a general monomial potential. Interestingly, we see, right DM abundance can be achieved only in the case of bosonic reheating scenario, satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This provides a unique correlation between collider signal and the post-inflationary dynamics of the Universe within single-field inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the direct detection of the Higgsino-(and Wino-)like neutralino dark matter: Spin-dependent interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lightest neutralino ($\tilde{\chi}_1^0$) is a promising dark matter (DM) candidate in the R-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). In this work, we focus on dominantly Higgsino-like and Wino-like $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ DM, with small admixtures of gauginos and Higgsinos, respectively. In particular, we explore large one-loop corrections to the $\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \tilde{\chi}_1^0Z$ vertex, which can significantly affect the estimation of the spin-dependent $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$-nucleon scattering cross-section in the regions where such DM candidates are viable. We have used the on-shell renormalization scheme to estimate the relevant counterterm contributions. In the parameter region where $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ is dominantly Higgsino-like, the radiative corrections (including the contributions from the respective counterterms) are substantial and can enhance the $\tilde{\chi}_1^0\tilde{\chi}_1^0Z$ vertex by up to $\sim 120\%$ for the benchmark scenarios we have considered. Further, for an almost pure Wino-like $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$, the increment in the $\tilde{\chi}_1^0\tilde{\chi}_1^0Z$ vertext is up to $15\%$. The corresponding cross-sections with the proton and the neutron can be changed by up to about $50\%$. In addition, including the electroweak box diagrams, the cross-sections can be significantly enhanced, in particular, for the Wino-like $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$.</description>

      <title>Electroweak renormalization of neutralino-Higgs interactions at one-loop and its impacts on spin-independent direct detection of Wino-like dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Wino-like neutralino dark matter (DM) in the form of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) has been considered one of the popular paradigms that can naturally accommodate {\it new physics} at a relatively higher scale, typically beyond the reach of the LHC. The constraint on the DM relic density typically implies a lightest neutralino mass $\simeq 2$ TeV. Its observational signature through nuclear recoil experiments, specifically involving DM-nucleon spin-independent (SI) scattering, is not impressive, following its high masses and tiny Higgsino fractions. The theoretical calculations can be improved when we compute all the one-loop electroweak (EW) corrections to the three-point vertices for the neutralino (Wino)-Higgs interactions, which in turn boosts the DM-nucleon scattering cross-sections through the SM-like Higgs exchange. Importantly, we include the counterterm contributions. In addition, we incorporate the other next-to-leading order (NLO) EW DM-quark and DM-gluon interactions present in the literature to calculate the DM-nucleon cross-sections. With the improved and precise theoretical estimates, DM-nucleon scattering cross-sections may increase or decrease significantly by more than $100\%$ compared to leading order (LO) cross-sections in different parts of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Studying the nature of the lightest charmed axial mesons via femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss how femtoscopic analysis can shed light on the nature of the two lightest axial charmed mesons, denominated as $D_1(2430)$ and $D_1(2420)$, whose masses are similar but widths are different. Their properties are reasonably described taking into account meson-meson coupled channel dynamics and a bare quark-model pole constituting the lowest-order amplitudes. Two different bare quark-model states are used in order to accommodate the different scattering lengths coming from the lattice QCD calculations for the $D\pi$ and $D^*\pi$ systems and the data from the ALICE Collaboration on the $D\pi$ system. The amplitudes are employed as inputs to determine the correlation functions for the $D^{*}\pi$ and $D\rho$ channels and identify the signatures associated with the lowest-lying axial charmed mesons.</description>

      <title>Optimal Equivariant Architectures from the Symmetries of Matrix-Element Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Matrix-Element Method (MEM) has long been a cornerstone of data analysis in high-energy physics. It leverages theoretical knowledge of parton-level processes and symmetries to evaluate the likelihood of observed events. In parallel, the advent of geometric deep learning has enabled neural network architectures that incorporate known symmetries directly into their design, leading to more efficient learning. This paper presents a novel approach that combines MEM-inspired symmetry considerations with equivariant neural network design for particle physics analysis. Even though Lorentz invariance and permutation invariance overall reconstructed objects are the largest and most natural symmetry in the input domain, we find that they are sub-optimal in most practical search scenarios. We propose a longitudinal boost-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture that preserves relevant discrete symmetries. We present numerical studies demonstrating MEM-inspired architectures achieve new state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing di-Higgs decays to four bottom quarks from the QCD background, with enhanced sample and parameter efficiencies. This synergy between MEM and equivariant deep learning opens new directions for physics-informed architecture design, promising more powerful tools for probing physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors in kinetic theory with two different relaxation times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a Boltzmann equation for massless quark and gluon fluids in a transversally homogeneous, longitudinally boost-invariant expansion. Quarks can be out of chemical equilibrium and the relaxation times of the two species are assumed to be connected by Casimir scaling. We numerically calculate moments of the distribution functions, identifying their early- and late-time attractors and reconstructing also the full distributions. These attractors appear when the system is still far from local thermalization, before hydrodynamics traditionally would be expected to apply. We also analyze the evolution of entropy production for different initial momentum anisotropies and quark abundances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The top-quark mass is a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model, as it plays a crucial role in the electroweak precision tests, stability of the vacuum and inflation. I review the method and the main results contained in a recent ATLAS analysis which measures the top mass by using the invariant mass of the leptons coming from W and B-hadron decays. The extracted top mass turns out to be the most precise single measurement by ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Mixing mechanism for the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are three scalar nonets in the Particle Data Group (PDG), one of which includes [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$], another includes [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$], and the third includes [$a_0(1710), K_0^*(1950)$]. Motivated by Ref.[1], we examine an alternative mixing mechanism that could potentially explain the small mass difference between the $a_0 (1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$. According to the tetraquark mixing model, two types, distinguished by their color-spin structures, are necessary to describe the tetraquark structure of the two nonets containing [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$]. Considering the color-spin structures, we argue that the mixing mechanism generating $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$ on the one hand, and $a_0(1710)$ and $K_0^* (1950)$ on the other hand might be relevant for resolving the small mass difference. We also discuss the limitations of other mixing mechanisms that generate the two nonets involving [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$] or [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1710)$, $K_0^* (1950)$]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the renormalization constant of the pseudoscalar operator defined with a non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in dimensional regularization up to four-loop order in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Furthermore, by virtue of renormalization-group invariance of the relation between the scalar and the pseudoscalar operator, we predict the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ factor of the renormalization constant for the latter at five-loop order in QCD.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of quarkonium master equation beyond the dipole approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QTRAJ is a computer code that simulates the propagation of quarkonium in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) based on the quantum-trajectory algorithm. This algorithm solves a master equation in which the quarkonium is treated as an open quantum system (OQS). A major advantage of this approach is that it turns a 3D spatial evolution for a density matrix into a 1D Schr\"odinger equation for a wavefunction with a non-hermitian Hamiltonian, drastically reducing the computational cost. So far, the interaction implemented in the master equation was obtained within the framework of potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD), and restricted to the regime $rT \ll 1$, where $r$ is the size of the color dipole and $T$ is the temperature. In the environment produced in heavy-ion collisions (HIC's) this limit is accurate for $\Upsilon(1S)$, but the applicability to other quarkonium states is dubious. In the present study we generalize the above approach, extending it to the regime $rT\!\sim\! 1$ in the one-gluon exchange approximation, with proper Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) resummation of medium effects. This is done by implementing new jump operators connecting different color states of the $Q\bar Q$ pair and expanding them in plane waves, giving rise to a variation of the algorithm present in QTRAJ 1.0. Here we provide an overview of this approach comparing the $rT \ll 1$ and $rT\sim 1$ cases, and we discuss prospects for phenomenological application to excited states of bottomonium.</description>

      <title>Fermion masses and mixing in SO(10) GUT with a universal two-zero texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a universal two-zero texture (UTZT) to all mass matrices for matters in their flavour space in SO(10) GUT framework. This texture can be realised by assigning different charge for each family in a $Z_6$ symmetry. By fixing charged fermion masses at their best-fit values, we fit the rest 9 precisely measured observables (three angles and one CP-violating phase in the quark mixing, three angles in the lepton mixing, and two neutrino mass-squared differences) with 8 model parameters. The model fits all data of fermion masses and mixing very well and the leptonic CP-violating phase is predicted in the range $(90^\circ, 230^\circ)$. The model further predicts the right-handed neutrino masses, with the lightest and heaviest of order $10^9$ and $10^{12}$ GeV, respectively. Gauge unification and proton decay have been checked with the assumption of a breaking chain with two intermediate symmetries above the electroweak scale. It indicates that $\alpha_{\rm GUT}$ ranges in (0.022,0.032) as long as the assumption of economical choice of Higgs contents, and $M_{\rm GUT}$ should be bigger than $4.5\times 10^{15}$ GeV to meet the Super-K bound. We show effective mass $m_{ee}$ for neutrinoless double beta decay, which provides us with a possibility to test grand unification with neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.</description>

We describe this system using an effective kinetic theory, given by the relativistic Boltzmann equation coupled to a temperature-dependent background field determined from the thermal masses. We then simplify the collision term using the relaxation time approximation and implement a Chapman-Enskog expansion to calculate all first-order transport coefficients. In particular, we compute the bulk and shear viscosities using thermal masses extracted from the linear sigma model coupled with constituent quarks and the NJL model.</description>

      <title>Six-jet production from triple parton scatterings in proton-proton collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of six energetic jets in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC is studied as a means to directly observe for the first time the simultaneous scattering of three partons. The single-parton-scattering (SPS) cross sections for the production 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-jets in pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV, are calculated up to next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics with the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and ALPGEN codes complemented with Pythia-8 for parton showering, hadronization, and decays. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm with distance parameter $R=0.4$. Assuming factorization of multiple hard-scattering probabilities in terms of SPS cross sections, the contributions to six-jet production from double- (DPS) and triple- (TPS) parton scatterings are derived. We find that the TPS contributions represent a ${\approx}20\%$ (${\approx}1\%$) fraction of the total 6-jets yields for minimum jet transverse momenta of $p_{T,min} = 20$ ($40$) GeV. A detailed multivariate analysis with realistic simulations of fully reconstructed jet samples for the TPS signal and DPS and SPS backgrounds indicates that TPS can be observed in events with six jets with $p_{T,min}=40$ GeV each, by collecting an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{O}(50$ pb$^{-1}$) in a dedicated low-pileup run at the LHC.</description>

      <title>A novel quantum machine learning classifier to search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that, the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small, and future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as the precision tests of the SM advances, rarer processes with a greater number of final-state particles will require consideration, which will in turn require the analysis of a multitude of observables. As an inherent consequence of the high luminosity, the generation of a large amount of experimental data in a large feature space presents a significant challenge for data processing. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose a variational quantum searching neighbor~(VQSN) algorithm to search for NP. As an example, we apply the VQSN in the phenomenological study of the gluon quartic gauge couplings~(gQGCs) at the Large Hadron Collider. The results suggest that VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel analytical approach to calculating phase-space integrals, crucial for precision in particle physics. We develop a method to compute angular components using multifold Mellin-Barnes integrals, yielding results in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms for integrals involving three denominators. Our results include expressions for massless momenta up to $\cal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ and for one massive momentum up to $\cal{O}(\epsilon)$. Additionally, we derive recursion relations that reduce integrals with higher powers of denominators to simpler ones. We detail how to combine the angular part with the radial one which requires a careful handling of singularities.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Emission of Dark Matter via Thermal Scattering: Novel Limits for Freeze-In and eV Cold Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, one of the present authors noticed a stimulated emission process of bosonic dark matter via the two-body decay of a mother particle in a thermal plasma similar to the operation principle of a laser in 2301.08735. In this paper, we show that in a $2 \to 2$ process, including a bosonic final particle (e.g., an axion or dark photon), the stimulated emission occurs as well due to a small angle scattering of the thermal mother particles and thus the phenomenon is more universal. Two important conclusions follow: (1) Care must be taken when studying the freeze-in production of a bosonic dark matter, as the abundance and momentum distribution of dark matter can differ significantly due to this effect. (2) eV-mass-range bosonic dark matter is special and theoretically well-motivated because models for freeze-in or other thermal production of dark matter include the parameter region of cold eV dark matter. We also study the dark matter mass effect for the stimulated emission.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Quasi-Dilaton Massive Gravity with Non-minimal Kinetic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological implications of the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with a non-minimal kinetic coupling. We investigate the resulting gravitational dynamics by introducing a nonzero mass for the graviton. We derive the complete set of background equations of motion and obtain self-accelerating background solutions to explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe using the effective cosmological constant originating from massive gravity. Furthermore, we derive the dispersion relation of gravitational waves to obtain the stability condition of the system. This allows us to use the propagation of gravitational perturbations in a Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology to constrain the quasi-dilaton massive gravity with a non-minimal kinetic coupling theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by different approaches to quantum gravity, one could consider that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature at all energy scales. Following this spirit, modified dispersion relations have been used to encapsulate quantum gravity phenomenology. In the present work, we propose a class of Lorentz invariance violating phenomenological dispersion relations, which could be different for each particle species, to study the generalized vacuum Cherenkov radiation process. We identify the kinematic regions where the process is allowed and then compute the energy loss rate due to the emission of vacuum electromagnetic and gravitational Cherenkov radiation. Furthermore, we estimate constraints for the Lorentz invariance breaking parameters of protons and gravitons taking into account the existence (or absence) of vacuum gravitational Cherenkov radiation using ultra high energy cosmic ray detections.</description>

      <title>Thin-wall vacuum decay in the presence of a compact dimension meets the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposal of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant in the late universe, mirroring a transition from anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) space, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a compelling framework for ameliorating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. An attractive theoretical realisation that accommodates the AdS $\to$ dS transition relies on the Casimir forces of fields inhabiting the bulk of a 5-dimensional (5-dim) set up. Among the fields characterising the dark sector, there is a real scalar field $\phi$ endowed with a potential holding two local minima with very small difference in vacuum energy and bigger curvature (mass) of the lower one. Shortly after the false vacuum tunnels to its true vacuum state, $\phi$ becomes more massive and its contribution to the Casimir energy becomes exponentially suppressed. The tunneling process then changes the difference between the total number of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom contributing to the quantum corrections of the vacuum energy, yielding the AdS $\to$ dS transition. We investigate the properties of this theoretical realisation to validate its main hypothesis and characterise free parameters of the model. We adopt the Coleman-de Luccia formalism for calculating the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation. We show that the Euclidean bounce configuration that drives the transition between $\phi$ vacua has associated at least a sixth order potential. We also show that distinctive features of the required vacuum decay to accommodate the AdS $\to$ dS transition are inconsistent with a 5-dim non-compact description of the instanton, for which the bounce is $O(5)$ symmetric, and instead call for a 5-dim instanton with a compact dimension, for which the bounce is $O(4)\times U(1)$ symmetric.</description>

Abstract: The spontaneous conversion of muonium to antimuonium is one of the interesting charged lepton flavor violation phenomena, offering a sensitive probe of potential new physics and serving as a tool to constrain the parameter space beyond the Standard Model. Utilizing a high-intensity muon beam, a Michel electron magnetic spectrometer and a positron transport solenoid together with a positron detection system, MACE aims to discover or constrain this rare process at the conversion probability beyond the level of $10^{-13}$. This report provides an overview of the theoretical framework and detailed experimental design in the search for the muonium-to-antimuonium conversion.</description>

Abstract: The Square Kilometer Array will initiate a new era of radio astronomy by allowing 3D imaging of the Universe during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization. Modern machine learning is crucial to analyse the highly structured and complex signal. However, accurate training data is expensive to simulate, and supervised learning may not generalize. We introduce a self-supervised vision transformer, SKATR, whose learned encoding can be cheaply adapted for downstream tasks on 21cm maps. Focusing on regression and generative inference of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, we demonstrate that SKATR representations are maximally informative and that SKATR generalises out-of-domain to differently-simulated, noised, and higher-resolution datasets.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of power-law cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the stability analysis of power-law models, focusing on an alternative approach that differs significantly from the standard approaches used in studying power-law models. In the standard approach, stability is studied by reducing the system of background FRW equations to a one-dimensional system for a new background variable $X$ in terms of the number of e-foldings. However, we rewrote the equations, including $H$ also into the system and went on to do the calculations up to second order. We demonstrate by computing the deviations from the power-law exact solution to second-order and show that power-law contraction is never an attractor, regardless of parameter values. Our analysis shows that while first-order corrections align with existing interpretations, second-order corrections introduce significant deviations that cannot be explained by a simple time shift that explains the first-order diverging terms. We also support our claim with numerical results. This new insight has broader implications for the study of attractor behaviour of differential equation solutions and raises questions about the stability of scenarios like the ekpyrotic bounce driven by an exponential potential.</description>

      <title>Gravothermalizing into primordial black holes, boson stars, and cannibal stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very little is known about the cosmological history from after the end of inflation until Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Various well-motivated models predict that the universe could have undergone a period of matter domination in this early epoch. We demonstrate that if the particles causing matter domination have self-interactions, they can form halos that undergo a gravothermal collapse. This scenario, in principle, provides a novel way to produce primordial black holes within the mass range of $1$ to $10^{26}$ g. We also find that it is not only black holes that can form in the aftermath of a gravothermal evolution. In particular, we show that number-changing annihilations of the particles can create sufficient heat to halt the gravothermal evolution, thus forming a "cannibal star". Likewise, the pressure from the particle's repulsive self-interactions can form a boson star during a gravothermal evolution. Thus, our study highlights that structure formation in the early universe can have a rich complexity.</description>

Abstract: Dark photons are predicted by various new physics models, and are being intensively studied in a variety of experiments. In the first part of this paper, we obtain partial wave unitarity constraints on the dark photon parameter space from the allowed $VV\rightarrow VV$ scattering processes in the limit of large center-of-mass energy, where $V=W,Z$. In the second part of the paper, searches are performed using the expected differential rates with a realistic detector simulation including a comprehensive set of background processes on dilepton and dilepton plus a photon events at the High Luminosity LHC. In these searches, sensitive differential distributions are used in an optimized way to determine the sensitivity to dark photon parameter space. It is shown that remarkable sensitivity to the dark photon model is achieved and kinetic mixing strength can be probed down to $(1.4-10)\times 10^{-4}$ for dark photon mass between $15$ GeV to $2$ TeV. We also investigate the sensitivity of a future muon collider suggested by the Muon Accelerator Program (MAP) to the dark photon model at different center-of-mass energies. It is shown that a future muon collider is able to reach a sensitivity to kinetic mixing at the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present the package {\sc NeatIBP}, which automatically generates small-size integration-by-parts (IBP) identities for Feynman integrals. Based on the syzygy and module intersection techniques, the generated IBP identities' propagator degree is controlled and thus the size of the system of IBP identities is shorter than that generated by the standard Laporta algorithm. This package is powered by the computer algebra systems {\sc Mathematica} and {\sc Singular}, and the library {\sc SpaSM}. It is parallelized on the level of Feynman integral sectors. The generated small-size IBP identities can subsequently be used for either finite field reduction or analytic reduction. We demonstrate the capabilities of this package on several multi-loop IBP examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We built an extended 2HDM theory with a spontaneously broken $U(1) _{X}$ global symmetry, where the tree level Universal Seesaw Mechanism generates the mass hierarchy of the Standard Model charged fermions and the Zee-Babu mechanism produces tiny active neutrino masses. The third family of SM charged fermions gets tree level masses from Yukawa interactions involving the Higgs doublets $H_1$ (for the top quark) and $H_2$ (for the bottom quark and tau lepton). The model under consideration is consistent with SM fermion masses and mixings, with the muon and electron $g-2$ anomalies and successfully accommodates the constraints arising from charged lepton flavor violation and meson oscillations. The proposed model predicts rates for charged lepton flavor violating decays within the reach of forthcoming experiments.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the signals from axion-like particles (ALPs) as dark matter mediators from celestial objects such as neutron stars, brown dwarfs or white dwarfs. We consider the accumulation of dark matter inside the celestial objects using the multiscatter capturing process. The production of ALP from the dark matter annihilation can escape the celestial object and decay into gamma-rays and neutrinos before reaching the Earth. We investigate our model using gamma-ray observations from Fermi and H.E.S.S. and neutrino observations from IceCube and ANTARES. The effective Lagrangian approach allows us to place constraints on the ALP-photon and ALP-fermion couplings. In the gamma-ray channel, our results are able to rule out the existence of ALP with mass up to $\sim \mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV. On the other hand, the neutrino observations can be used to probe a higher mass range with ALP mass up to $\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV.</description>

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the acceleration of magnetic monopoles in intergalactic magnetic fields. We demonstrate that monopoles with intermediate to low masses can be accelerated to relativistic velocities. This can significantly affect direct and indirect searches for magnetic monopoles. As an example, we show that the Parker bound is relaxed in the presence of intergalactic fields. We also find that a cosmic population of monopoles can produce significant backreaction on the intergalactic fields.</description>

      <title>Enabling Precise Predictions for Left-Right Symmetry at Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the minimal Left-Right symmetric model that enables precise predictions in the gauge, scalar and neutrino sector. We revisit the complete set of mass spectra and mixings for the charged and neutral gauge bosons, would-be-Goldstones and gauge fixing, together with the ghost Lagrangian. In the scalar sector, we analytically re-derive all the massive states with mixings and devise a non-trivial physical input scheme, expressing the model couplings in terms of masses and mixing angles. Fermion couplings are also determined in closed form, including the Dirac mixing in the neutrino sector, evaluated explicitly using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. These analytic developments are implemented in a comprehensive FeynRules model file. We calculate the one loop QCD corrections and provide a complete UFO file for NLO studies, demonstrated on relevant hadron-collider benchmarks. We provide various restricted variants of the model file with different gauges, massless states, neutrino hierarchies and parity violating $g_L \neq g_R$ gauge couplings.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and gluon cascades in the high energy limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out an interesting connection between the mathematical framework of the Krylov basis, which is used to quantify quantum complexity, and the entanglement entropy in high-energy QCD. In particular, we observe that the cascade equation of the dipole model is equivalent to the $SL(2,R)$ Schrodinger equation in the Krylov basis. Consequently, the Krylov complexity corresponds to the average distribution of partons and the Krylov entropy is the counterpart the entanglement entropy computations of \cite{Kharzeev:2017qzs}. Our work not only brings new tools for exploring quantum information and complexity in QCD, but also gives hope for experimental tests of some of the recent, physical probes of quantum complexity.</description>

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that modular symmetry may solve the strong CP problem without axions, by producing a vanishing QCD angle while generating a large quark CP violation phase. We extend this framework to finite modular groups, systematically identifying the allowed mass textures. We find quark fields must furnish 1D representations and scan the minimal model landscape.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrarelativistic Vortex Leptons with Large Orbital Angular Momenta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic vortex leptons with intrinsic orbital angular momenta (OAM) have important applications in high energy particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, etc. However, unfortunately, their generation still poses a great challenge. Here, we put forward a novel method for generating ultrarelativistic vortex positrons and electrons through nonlinear Breit-Wheeler (NBW) scattering of vortex $\gamma$ photons. For the first time, a complete angular momentum-resolved scattering theory has been formulated, introducing the angular momentum of laser photons and vortex particles into the conventional NBW scattering framework. We find that vortex positron (electron) can be produced when the outgoing electron (positron) is generated along the collision axis. By unveiling the angular momentum transfer mechanism, we clarify that OAM of the $\gamma$ photon and angular momenta of multiple laser photons are entirely transferred to the generated pairs, leading to the production of ultrarelativistic vortex positrons or electrons with large OAM. Furthermore, we find that the cone opening angle and superposition state of the vortex $\gamma$ photon, distinct characteristics aside from its intrinsic OAM, can be determined via the angular distribution of created pairs in NBW processes. Our method paves the way for investigating strong-field quantum electrodynamics processes concerning the generation and detection of vortex particle beams in intense lasers.</description>

      <title>Testing the Origins of Neutrino Mass with Supernova Neutrino Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown. Both the vacuum mass and the dark mass generated by the neutrino interaction with dark matter (DM) particles or fields can fit the current oscillation data. The dark mass squared is proportional to the DM number density and therefore varies on the galactic scale with much larger values around the Galactic Center. This affects the group velocity and the arrival time delay of core-collapse supernovae (SN) neutrinos. This time delay, especially for the $\nu_e$ neutronization peak with a sharp time structure, can be used to distinguish the vacuum and dark neutrino masses. For illustration, we explore the potential of DUNE which is sensitive to $\nu_e$. Our simulations show that DUNE can distinguish the two neutrino mass origins at more than $5\sigma\,$C.L., depending on the observed local value of neutrino mass, the neutrino mass ordering, the DM density profile, and the SN location.</description>

      <title>A 17 MeV pseudoscalar and the LSND, MiniBooNE and ATOMKI anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of any new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), anomalous results at low energy experiments have become the subject of increased attention. We focus on three such results from the LSND, MiniBooNE (MB), and ATOMKI experiments. A 17 MeV pseudoscalar mediator ($a'$) can account for two ($^8$Be and $^4$He) out of the three cases in which excess events have been seen in pair creation transitions in ATOMKI. We incorporate this mediator in a gauge invariant extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a second Higgs doublet and three singlet (seesaw) neutrinos ($N_i, i=1,2,3$). $N_{1,2}$ participate in an interaction in MB and LSND which, with $a'$ as mediator, leads to the production of $e^+ e^-$ pairs. The $N_i$ also lead to mass-squared differences for SM neutrinos in agreement with global oscillation data. We first show that such a model offers a natural joint solution to the MB and LSND excesses, providing excellent fits to their data. Next, using the values of the couplings to the quarks and electrons which are required to explain pair creation nuclear transition data for $^8$Be and $^4$He in ATOMKI, we show that these values still lead to fits for MB and LSND data. However, once ATOMKI is incorporated, we find that strong constraints from the decays $K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ a' \, (a'\rightarrow e^+e^-)$ and $\pi^+ \rightarrow $ $ e^+ ~\nu_e ~e^+ e^- $ come into play. While our solution is in conformity with the bounds on the former decay, it remains in tension with $90\%$ CL bounds on the latter. We also discuss other constraints from both collider and non-collider experiments and from electroweak precision data, stability and unitarity. We compute the contributions to the electron and muon $g-2$ up to two loops for our model. We discuss tests of the model in upcoming experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the renormalizable group equations (RGEs) of the extended strong and weak gauge couplings in an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory, where three-generational SM fermions are non-trivially embedded. This framework was previously found to generate the observed SM quark/lepton mass hierarchies and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing pattern through its maximally breaking pattern. The field theoretical two-loop RGEs can not achieve the gauge coupling unification with the minimal setup, unless additional adjoint Higgs fields as well as the gravity-induced $d=5$ term to the ${\rm SU}(8)$ field strength term are included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00426v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP violation in baryon decays has recently garnered significant attention. Traditionally, CP violation in charmed baryon decays is predicted to be at the order of $O(10^{-4})$. Utilizing recent measurements from BESIII, Belle and Belle~II experiments, we conduct a comprehensive global analysis to estimate the contribution of topological diagrams in these processes. Our study reveals that topological diagrams alone cannot fully account for the experimental data. By incorporating new effects that are not included in traditional topological diagrams and exploring the possible source of the new effect, our analysis reveals the potential for significant CP violation in $\Lambda_c^+\to n \pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^+\to \Xi^0 K^+$. This suggests a promising opportunity to observe CP violation for the first time in charmed baryon decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reanalyzes the detection prospects of dark matter (DM) annihilation signals in the Galactic Center, focusing on velocity-dependent dynamics within a spike density near the supermassive black hole (Sgr~A$^{\star}$). We investigate three annihilation processes -- $p$-wave, resonance, and forbidden annihilation -- under semi-relativistic velocities, leveraging gamma-ray data from Fermi and DAMPE telescopes. Our analysis integrates a fermionic DM model with an electroweak axion-like particle (ALP) portal, exploring annihilation into two or four photons. Employing a comprehensive six-dimensional integration, we precisely calculate DM-induced gamma-ray fluxes near Sgr~A$^{\star}$, incorporating velocity and positional dependencies in the annihilation cross-section and photon yield spectra. Our findings highlight scenarios of resonance and forbidden annihilation, where the larger ALP-DM-DM coupling constant $C_{a\chi\chi}$ can affect spike density, potentially yielding detectable gamma-ray line spectra within Fermi and DAMPE energy resolution. We set upper limits for $C_{a\chi\chi}$ across these scenarios, offering insights into the detectability and spectral characteristics of DM annihilation signals from the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>One-loop impact factors for heavy quarkonium production: $S$-wave case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the aim to extend the study of inclusive heavy quarkonium production at forward rapidities with the resummation of high partonic center-of-momentum-energy logarithms beyond Leading Logarithmic Approximation (LLA), the explicit analytic results for one-loop corrections to the following impact factors had been obtained: $\gamma R \to Q\bar{Q}\left[^1S_0^{[8]} \right]$, $g R \to Q\bar{Q}\left[^1S_0^{[1]} \right]$, $gR\to Q\bar{Q}\left[ ^1S_0^{[8]} \right]$ and $gR\to Q\bar{Q}\left[ ^3S_1^{[8]}\right]$, with $R$ being the Reggeized gluon and $Q$ is the heavy quark. The computation is done in the framework of Lipatov's gauge-invariant EFT for Multi-Regge processes in QCD with the tilted-Wilson-line regularisation for rapidity divergences. As expected, only single-logarithmic rapidity divergence proportional to the one-loop Regge trajectory of a gluon remains in the final result for impact-factors. Numerical comparison with Regge limits ($s/(-t) \gg 1$) of one-loop QCD amplitudes, described in the paper, provides a strong cross-check of obtained results. The relations of obtained results with other regularisation schemes for rapidity divergences used in low-$x$ physics, such as BFKL scheme, High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) scheme and shockwave scheme, are given.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the interactions between light axion-like particles (ALPs) and top quarks, gluons, and W-bosons. Utilizing high-energy probes at the LHC, we probe these couplings in the context of single top quark production associated with a W-boson and an ALP. We analyze the latest LHC Run II data on $t\bar{t}$ spin correlation measurements to establish constraints on these couplings. Additionally, we compare these constraints with those derived from loop-induced couplings and indirect searches involving B-meson decays. Furthermore, we derive two-dimensional limits on the ALP couplings with top quarks and gluons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an $SO(10)$ model in which a dimension five operator induces kinetic mixing at the GUT scale between the abelian subgroups $U(1)_{B-L}$ and $U(1)_R$. We discuss in this framework gauge coupling unification and proton decay, as well as the appearance of superheavy quasistable strings with $G\mu \sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-5}$, where $\mu$ denotes the dimensionless string tension parameter. We use Bayesian analysis to show that for $G\mu$ values $\sim 4 \times 10^{-7} - 10^{-5}$, the gravitational wave spectrum emitted from the quasistable strings is in good agreement with the recent pulsar timing array data. Corresponding to $G \mu$ values $\sim 10^{-8} - 2 \times 10^{-7}$, proton decay is expected to occur at a rate accessible in the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. Finally, we present the gravitational wave spectrum emitted by effectively stable strings with $G\mu\approx 10^{-8}$ that have experienced a certain amount of inflation. This can be tested with future detectors in the $\mu$Hz frequency range.</description>

      <title>T-odd observables from anomalous $tbW$ couplings in single-top production at an $ep$ collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that an imaginary anomalous $tbW$ coupling can be measured in the process $e^-p \to \nu_e \overline t X$ by means of T-odd observables. One such observable considered here is the polarization of the top antiquark transverse to the production plane. The other is a T-odd correlation constructed out of observable momenta when the top quark decays leptonically. Both these T-odd observables are shown to be proportional to the imaginary part of only one of the $tbW$ anomalous couplings, the other couplings giving either vanishing or negligible contribution. This imaginary part could signal either a CP-odd coupling, or an absorptive part in the effective coupling, or both. We estimate the 1-$\sigma$ limits that might be derived in the case of each of these observables for a collider with a proton energy of 7 TeV and an electron energy of 60 GeV and also in the case of a higher electron energy of 150 GeV.</description>

      <title>A New-Old Approach to Composite Scalars with Chiral Fermion Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical, Lorentz invariant theory of composite scalars in configuration space consisting of chiral fermions, interacting by the perturbative exchange of a massive "gluon" of coupling $g_0$ and mass $M_0^2$ (the coloron model). The formalism is inspired by, but goes beyond, old ideas of Yukawa and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. It yields a non-pointlike internal wave-function of the bound state, $\phi(r)$, which satisfies a Schr\"odinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) equation with eigenvalue $\mu^2$. For super-critical coupling, $g_0 &gt;g_{0c}$, we have $\mu^2&lt; 0$ leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The binding of chiral fermions is semiclassical, and not loop-level as in NJL. The mass scale is determined by the interaction as in NJL. We mainly focus on the short-distance, large $M_0^2$ limit, yielding an NJL pointlike interaction, but the bound state internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$, remains spatially extended and dilutes $\phi(0)$. This leads to power-law suppression of the induced Yukawa and quartic couplings and requires radically less fine-tuning of a hierarchy than does the NJL model. We include a discussion of loop corrections of the theory. A realistic top--condensation model appears possible.</description>

      <title>Charged Lepton Flavour Violating Meson Decays in Seesaw Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of neutrino oscillations demands the existence of flavour violation in charged lepton sector. The relation between the branching ratios of different charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV) decay modes depends on the details of the neutrino mass model. In this work, we consider the three types of simple seesaw mechanisms of neutrino masses and study the correlation between the radiative CLFV decays and the meson CLFV decays. We find that the meson CLFV decay branching ratios are negligibly small in type-II seesaw mechanism whereas they are constrained to be at least three (two) orders of magnitude smaller than the radiative CLFV decay branching ratios in the case of type-I (type-III) seesaw mechanism. Thus the relationship between these two modes of CLFV decays helps in distinguishing between different types of seesaw mechanism. If, the branching ratios of CLFV decays of mesons are larger than those of radiative CLFV decays, it provides a strong hint that the neutrino mass generating mechanism is more complicated than simple seesaw.</description>

      <title>Underdetermination of dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is compelling evidence that the Universe is undergoing a late phase of accelerated expansion. One of the simplest explanations for this behaviour is the presence of dark energy. A plethora of microphysical models for dark energy have been proposed. The hope is that, with the ever increasing precision of cosmological surveys, it will be possible to precisely pin down the model. We show that this is unlikely and that, at best, we will have a phenomenological description for the microphysics of dark energy. Furthermore, we argue that the current phenomenological prescriptions are ill-equipped for shedding light on the fundamental theory of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Distinctive GWBs from eccentric inspiraling SMBH binaries with a DM spike</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent detections of a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) from various pulsar-timing-array (PTA) observations have renewed the interest in the inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), whose population is believed to be the most promising candidate with possible generalizations from including either orbital eccentricity or dark matter (DM) spike. In this Letter, we show that the inclusion of both can further display distinctive features detectable in future PTA observations. With a typical initial eccentricity $e_0\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for the inspiraling SMBHBs, even a shallow DM spike can easily drive the orbital eccentricity close to $1$, leaving behind a large turnover eccentricity when GWs begin to dominate the orbital circularization. In particular, the DM spike index $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ universally manifests itself in the characteristic strain by $h_c\sim f^{7/6-\gamma_\mathrm{sp}/3}$ in the far infrared and features a novel oscillation structure at low frequencies. Future PTA detection of such characteristics would be the smoking gun for the DM spike and even reveal the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Split of the pseudo-critical temperatures of chiral and confine/deconfine transitions by temperature gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching of the critical endpoint of the phase transition of Quantum Chromodynamics~(QCD) matter in experiments is of great interest. The temperature in the fireball of a collider is location dependent, however, most theoretical studies address the scenario of uniform temperature. In this work, the effect of temperature gradients is investigated using lattice QCD approach. We find that the temperature gradient catalyzes chiral symmetry breaking, meanwhile the temperature gradient increases the Polyakov loop in the confined phase but suppresses the Polyakov loop in the deconfined phase. Furthermore, the temperature gradient decreases the pseudo-critical temperature of chiral transition but increases the pseudo-critical temperature of the confine/deconfine transition.</description>

      <title>Covariant Lagrangian Cubic Interaction Vertices For Irreducible Higher Spin Fields in Minkowski Backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the application of BRST and BRST-BV approaches to construct the generic off-shell local Lorentz covariant cubic interaction vertices for irreducible massless and massive higher integer spin fields (as the candidates for massive particles in the Dark Matter problem) on $d$-dimensional Minkowski spaces. It is shown that equivalence among two Lagrangian dynamics for the same cubically interacting fields with given masses and spins obtained by means of the approach with complete BRST, $Q$, operator and of one with incomplete BRST, $Q_c$, operator in presence of consistent off-shell holonomic (traceless) constraints can be uplifted from the equivalence of the Lagrangians for free higher spin fields. We found that to get non-contradictory Lagrangians for irreducible interacting higher-spin fields within approach with $Q_c$ operator, together with off-shell algebraic constraints in addition to necessary condition of superconmmuting of $Q_c$ with appropriate holonomic constraints on the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian superalgebra both with BRST operator above and with operators of cubic vertices.</description>

      <title>Mass function of stellar black holes as revealed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ninety gravitational wave events have been detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and are released in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Among these events, 83 cases are definitely binary black hole mergers since the masses of all the objects involved significantly exceed the upper limit of neutron stars. The black holes in these merger events naturally form two interesting samples, a pre-merger sample that includes all the black holes before the mergers and a post-merger sample that consists of the black holes generated during the merging processes. The former represents black holes that once existed in the Universe, while the latter represents newly born black holes. Here we present a statistical analysis on these two samples. The non-parametric $\tau$ statistic method is adopted to correct for the observational selection effect. The Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method is further applied to derive the mass distribution and density function of black holes. It is found that the mass distribution can be expressed as a broken power-law function. More interestingly, the power-law index in the high mass region is comparable for the two samples. The number density of black holes is found to depend on redshift as $\rho(z) \propto z^{-2.06}$ -- $z^{-2.12}$ based on the two samples. Implications of these findings on the origin of black holes are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of false vacuum decay in arbitrary dimensions, in the presence of gravity, and compute the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation, generalising the results of Coleman and de Luccia. In the particular case of one compact dimension, we present explicit formulae for the Euclidean Bounce configuration that drives the transition from a de Sitter to Minkowski or from a Minkowski to anti-de Sitter vacua.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct static and axially symmetric magnetically charged hairy black holes in the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory. Large black holes merge with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) family, while the small ones are extremal and support a hair in the form of a ring-shaped electroweak condensate carrying superconducting W-currents and up to $22\%$ of the total magnetic charge. The extremal solutions are asymptotically RN with a mass {\it below} the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate interacting with the black hole magnetic field. Therefore, they cannot decay into RN black holes. As their charge increases, they show a phase transition when the horizon symmetry changes from spherical to oblate. At this point they have the mass typical for planetary size black holes of which $\approx 11\%$ is stored in the hair. Being obtained within a well-tested theory, our solutions are expected to be physically relevant.</description>

      <title>Energy-Momentum tensor correlators in $\phi^4$ theory I: The spin-zero sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the renormalized trace $\Theta$ of the Energy-Momentum tensor in the four-dimensional $\lambda\phi^4$ theory,using dimensional regularization in $d=4-\ve$ dimensions. We first construct several basic correlators such as $\braket{\phi^2 \phi\phi}$, $\braket{\phi^4 \phi \phi}$ to order $\lambda^2$ and from these the correlators $\braket{K_I \phi \phi}$ and $\braket{K_I K_J}$ with $K_I$ the basis of dimension $d$ operators. We then match the limit of their expressions on the Wilson-Fisher fixed point to the corresponding expressions obtained in Conformal Field Theory. Then, using the 3-point function $\braket{\Theta\phi\phi}$, we construct the operator $\Theta$ as a certain linear combination of the basis operators, using the requirements that $\Theta$ should vanish on the fixed point and that it should have zero anomalous dimension. Finally, we compute the 2-point function $\braket{\Theta\Theta}$ and we show that it obeys an eigenvalue equation that gives additional information about the internal structure of the Energy-Momentum tensor operator to what is already contained in its Callan-Symanzik equation.</description>
