      <title>Federated Digital Twin Construction via Distributed Sensing: A Game-Theoretic Online Optimization with Overlapping Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel federated framework for constructing the digital twin (DT) model, referring to a living and self-evolving visualization model empowered by artificial intelligence, enabled by distributed sensing under edge-cloud collaboration. In this framework, the DT model to be built at the cloud is regarded as a global one being split into and integrating from multiple functional components, i.e., partial-DTs, created at various edge servers (ESs) using feature data collected by associated sensors. Considering time-varying DT evolutions and heterogeneities among partial-DTs, we formulate an online problem that jointly and dynamically optimizes partial-DT assignments from the cloud to ESs, ES-sensor associations for partial-DT creation, and as well as computation and communication resource allocations for global-DT integration. The problem aims to maximize the constructed DT's model quality while minimizing all induced costs, including energy consumption and configuration costs, in long runs. To this end, we first transform the original problem into an equivalent hierarchical game with an upper-layer two-sided matching game and a lower-layer overlapping coalition formation game. After analyzing these games in detail, we apply the Gale-Shapley algorithm and particularly develop a switch rules-based overlapping coalition formation algorithm to obtain short-term equilibria of upper-layer and lower-layer subgames, respectively. Then, we design a deep reinforcement learning-based solution, called DMO, to extend the result into a long-term equilibrium of the hierarchical game, thereby producing the solution to the original problem. Simulations show the effectiveness of the introduced framework, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over counterparts.</description>

      <title>Attention on Personalized Clinical Decision Support System: Federated Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Health management has become a primary problem as new kinds of diseases and complex symptoms are introduced to a rapidly growing modern society. Building a better and smarter healthcare infrastructure is one of the ultimate goals of a smart city. To the best of our knowledge, neural network models are already employed to assist healthcare professionals in achieving this goal. Typically, training a neural network requires a rich amount of data but heterogeneous and vulnerable properties of clinical data introduce a challenge for the traditional centralized network. Moreover, adding new inputs to a medical database requires re-training an existing model from scratch. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep learning-based clinical decision support system trained and managed under a federated learning paradigm. We focused on a novel strategy to guarantee the safety of patient privacy and overcome the risk of cyberattacks while enabling large-scale clinical data mining. As a result, we can leverage rich clinical data for training each local neural network without the need for exchanging the confidential data of patients. Moreover, we implemented the proposed scheme as a sequence-to-sequence model architecture integrating the attention mechanism. Thus, our objective is to provide a personalized clinical decision support system with evolvable characteristics that can deliver accurate solutions and assist healthcare professionals in medical diagnosing.</description>

      <title>CLIP-PING: Boosting Lightweight Vision-Language Models with Proximus Intrinsic Neighbors Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03871v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond the success of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), recent trends mark a shift toward exploring the applicability of lightweight vision-language models for resource-constrained scenarios. These models often deliver suboptimal performance when relying solely on a single image-text contrastive learning objective, spotlighting the need for more effective training mechanisms that guarantee robust cross-modal feature alignment. In this work, we propose CLIP-PING: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training with Proximus Intrinsic Neighbors Guidance, a novel yet simple and efficient training paradigm designed to boost the performance of lightweight vision-language models with minimal computational overhead and lower data demands. CLIP-PING bootstraps unimodal features extracted from arbitrary pre-trained encoders to obtain intrinsic guidance of proximus neighbor samples, i.e., nearest-neighbor (NN) and cross nearest-neighbor (XNN). We find that extra contrastive supervision from these neighbors substantially boosts cross-modal alignment, enabling lightweight models to learn more generic features with rich semantic diversity. Extensive experiments reveal that CLIP-PING notably surpasses its peers in zero-shot generalization and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Specifically, a 5.5% gain on zero-shot ImageNet1K classification with 10.7% (I2T) and 5.7% (T2I) on Flickr30K retrieval, compared to the original CLIP when using ViT-XS image encoder trained on 3 million (image, text) pairs. Moreover, CLIP-PING showcases a strong transferability under the linear evaluation protocol across several downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>LeRAAT: LLM-Enabled Real-Time Aviation Advisory Tool</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In aviation emergencies, high-stakes decisions must be made in an instant. Pilots rely on quick access to precise, context-specific information -- an area where emerging tools like large language models (LLMs) show promise in providing critical support. This paper introduces LeRAAT, a framework that integrates LLMs with the X-Plane flight simulator to deliver real-time, context-aware pilot assistance. The system uses live flight data, weather conditions, and aircraft documentation to generate recommendations aligned with aviation best practices and tailored to the particular situation. It employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that extracts and synthesizes information from aircraft type-specific manuals, including performance specifications and emergency procedures, as well as aviation regulatory materials, such as FAA directives and standard operating procedures. We showcase the framework in both a virtual reality and traditional on-screen simulation, supporting a wide range of research applications such as pilot training, human factors research, and operational decision support.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Analysis for Per-Instance Evaluation of Stochastic Optimizers: How Many Repeats Are Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key trait of stochastic optimizers is that multiple runs of the same optimizer in attempting to solve the same problem can produce different results. As a result, their performance is evaluated over several repeats, or runs, on the problem. However, the accuracy of the estimated performance metrics depends on the number of runs and should be studied using statistical tools. We present a statistical analysis of the common metrics, and develop guidelines for experiment design to measure the optimizer's performance using these metrics to a high level of confidence and accuracy. To this end, we first discuss the confidence interval of the metrics and how they are related to the number of runs of an experiment. We then derive a lower bound on the number of repeats in order to guarantee achieving a given accuracy in the metrics. Using this bound, we propose an algorithm to adaptively adjust the number of repeats needed to ensure the accuracy of the evaluated metric. Our simulation results demonstrate the utility of our analysis and how it allows us to conduct reliable benchmarking as well as hyperparameter tuning and prevent us from drawing premature conclusions regarding the performance of stochastic optimizers.</description>

      <title>Model-free front-to-end training of a large high performance laser neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs), have become ubiquitous and revolutionized many applications ranging from computer vision to medical diagnoses. However, they offer a fundamentally connectionist and distributed approach to computing, in stark contrast to classical computers that use the von Neumann architecture. This distinction has sparked renewed interest in developing unconventional hardware to support more efficient implementations of ANNs, rather than merely emulating them on traditional systems. Photonics stands out as a particularly promising platform, providing scalability, high speed, energy efficiency, and the ability for parallel information processing. However, fully realized autonomous optical neural networks (ONNs) with in-situ learning capabilities are still rare. In this work, we demonstrate a fully autonomous and parallel ONN using a multimode vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) using off-the-shelf components. Our ONN is highly efficient and is scalable both in network size and inference bandwidth towards the GHz range. High performance hardware-compatible optimization algorithms are necessary in order to minimize reliance on external von Neumann computers to fully exploit the potential of ONNs. As such we present and extensively study several algorithms which are broadly compatible with a wide range of systems. We then apply these algorithms to optimize our ONN, and benchmark them using the MNIST dataset. We show that our ONN can achieve high accuracy and convergence efficiency, even under limited hardware resources. Crucially, we compare these different algorithms in terms of scaling and optimization efficiency in term of convergence time which is crucial when working with limited external resources. Our work provides some guidance for the design of future ONNs as well as a simple and flexible way to train them.</description>

      <title>Exploring psychophysiological methods for human-robot collaboration in construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Psychophysiological methods present a promising approach to fostering enhanced mutual communication and collaboration between human workers and robots. Despite their potential, there is still limited understanding of how to effectively integrate psychophysiological methods to improve human-robot collaboration (HRC) in construction. This paper addresses this gap by critically reviewing the use of psychophysiological methods for HRC within construction environments, employing a concept-methodology-value philosophical framework. The analysis reveals that measuring brain activity using electroencephalography is the most widely used method, while most of the works are still at the proof of concept stage and lack empirical evidence. Three potential research directions were proposed: the integration of multi-modal psychophysiological signals, enriching the existing experimental settings for better generalizability, and leveraging advanced biocompatible or contactless technologies for effective signal detection. The findings should benefit subsequent exploration and practical applications of psychophysiological methods to enable better implementation of robots and support HRC in construction.</description>

Abstract: Pharmaceutical process design and development for generic, innovative, or personalized drugs have always been a time-consuming, costly, rigorous process, that involves multi-stage evaluation for better quality control and assurance. Large language models (LLMs), a type of generative artificial intelligence system, can augment laboratory research in the pharmaceutical engineering process by helping scientists to extract knowledge from literature, design parameters, and collect and interpret experimental data ultimately accelerating scientific discovery. LLMs with prompt engineering technologies change the researchers thinking protocol from traditional empirical knowledge to streamlined thinking that connects the performance and structured parameters together. In this work, we investigate and evaluate how prompt engineering technologies can enhance the drug design process from different strategies such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, etc. The dissolution profile for specific drugs is predicted and suggested from the LLMs model. Furthermore, the fundamental physical properties such as PSD, aspect ratio, and specific surface area could be inversely designed from the LLMs model. Finally, all the results are evaluated and validated by real-world cases to prove the reliability of prompt engineering techniques. Initial evaluations show an MSE of 23.61 and R2 of 0.97 in zero-shot, an MSE of 114.89 and R2 of 0.90 in zero-shot-CoT, an MSE of 57.0 and R2 of 0.92 in few-shot, a MSE of 22.56 and R2 of 0.97 in few-shot-CoT and a MSE of 10.56 and R2 of 0.99 with the involvement of RAG. This work breaks down any barriers in developing a systematic framework where LLMs assist in formulation design, process control, and decision-making. Finally, we conclude the work by discussing open challenges and future research directions in pharmaceutical processes.</description>

      <title>Solving Drone Routing Problems with Quantum Computing: A Hybrid Approach Combining Quantum Annealing and Gate-Based Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach to solving real-world drone routing problems by leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing. The proposed method, coined Quantum for Drone Routing (Q4DR), integrates the two most prominent paradigms in the field: quantum gate-based computing, through the Eclipse Qrisp programming language; and quantum annealers, by means of D-Wave System's devices. The algorithm is divided into two different phases: an initial clustering phase executed using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and a routing phase employing quantum annealers. The efficacy of Q4DR is demonstrated through three use cases of increasing complexity, each incorporating real-world constraints such as asymmetric costs, forbidden paths, and itinerant charging points. This research contributes to the growing body of work in quantum optimization, showcasing the practical applications of quantum computing in logistics and route planning.</description>
