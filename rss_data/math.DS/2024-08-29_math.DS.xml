      <title>A cycle with a "short" period in the phenomenological model of a single neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relay version of the generalized Hutchinson's equation as a phenomenological model of an isolated neuron. After an exponential substitution, the equation takes the form of a differential-difference equation with a piecewise-constant right-hand side. In the work of A. Yu. Kolesov and others, this equation was studied with a negative continuous initial function, and the existence and orbital stability of a periodic solution with a period longer than the delay were proven. In the present work, all possible solutions with continuous on the interval of the delay length initial functions, containing no more than two zeros, are constructed. It is proven that the equation has a periodically unstable solution, the period of which is shorter than the delay.</description>

      <title>A piecewise contractive map on triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a piecewise map defined on the set of three pairwise nonparallel, nonconcurrent lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The geometric map of study may be analogized to the billiard map with a different reflection rule so that each iteration is a contraction over the space, thereby providing asymptotic behavior of interest. Our study emphasizes the behavior of periodic orbits generated by the map, with description of their geometry and bifurcation behavior. We establish that for any initial point in the space, the orbit will converge to a fixed point or periodic orbit, and we demonstrate that there exists an infinite variety of periodic orbits the orbits may converge to, dependent on the parameters of the underlying space.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of translations on maximal compact subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of translations of an element of a semisimple Lie group $G$ acting on its maximal compact subgroup $K$. First, we extend to our context some classical results in the context of general flag manifolds, showing that when the element is hyperbolic its dynamics is gradient and its fixed points components are given by some suitable right cosets of the centralizer of the element in $K$. Second, we consider the dynamics of a general element and characterizes its recurrent set, its minimal Morse components and their stable and unstable manifolds in terms of the Jordan decomposition of the element, and we show that each minimal Morse component is normally hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>No Infinite Spin for Partial Collisions converging to isolated CC on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infinite spin problem is a problem concerning the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the $n$-body problem. The question makes also sense for partial collision. When a~cluster of bodies tends to a (partial) collision, then its normalized shape curve tends to the set of normalized central configurations, which in the planar case has $SO(2)$ symmetry. This leaves a possibility that the normalized shape curve tends to the circle obtained by rotation of some central configuration instead of a particular point on it. This is the \emph{infinite spin problem}. We show that it is not possible if the limiting circle is isolated from other connected components of set of normalized central configuration. Our approach extends the method from recent work for total collision by Moeckel and Montgomery, which was based on combination of the center manifold theorem with {\L}ojasiewicz inequality. To that we add a shadowing result for pseudo-orbits near normally hyperbolic manifold and careful estimates on the influence of other bodies on the cluster of colliding bodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the heterochaos baker maps whose central direction is mostly neutral, we prove that correlations for H\"older continuous functions decay at an optimal polynomial rate of order $n^{-3/2}$. Our method of proof relies on a description of the action of a reduced Perron-Frobenius operator by means of a comparison to the symmetric simple random walk with an absorbing wall, aka `gambler's ruin problem'.</description>

      <title>The Eisenhart Lift and Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known in general relativity that trajectories of Hamiltonian systems lift to geodesics of pp-wave spacetimes, an example of a more general phenomenon known as the "Eisenhart lift." We review and expand upon the benefits of this correspondence for dynamical systems theory. One benefit is the use of curvature and conjugate points to study the stability of Hamiltonian systems. Another benefit is that this lift unfolds a Hamiltonian system into a family of ODEs akin to a moduli space. One such family arises from the conformal invariance of lightlike geodesics, by which any Hamiltonian system unfolds into a "conformal class" of non-diffeomorphic ODEs with solutions in common. By utilizing higher-index versions of pp-waves, a similar lift and conformal class are shown to exist for certain second-order complex ODEs. Another such family occurs by lifting to a Riemannian metric that is dual to a pp-wave, a process that in certain cases yields a "square root" for the Hamiltonian. We prove a two-point boundary result for the family of ODEs arising from this lift, as well as the existence of a constant of the motion generalizing conservation of energy.</description>

      <title>Deformations of acid-mediated invasive tumors in a model with Allee effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Gatenby--Gawlinski-type model of invasive tumors in the presence of an Allee effect. We describe the construction of bistable one-dimensional traveling fronts using singular perturbation techniques in different parameter regimes corresponding to tumor interfaces with, or without, acellular gap. By extending the front as a planar interface, we perform a stability analysis to long wavelength perturbations transverse to the direction of front propagation and derive a simple stability criterion for the front in two spatial dimensions. In particular we find that in general the presence of the acellular gap indicates transversal instability of the associated planar front, which can lead to complex interfacial dynamics such as the development of finger-like protrusions and/or different invasion speeds.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's 16th problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.07193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an upper bound for the number of limit cycles that planar polynomial differential systems of a given degree may have. The bound turns out to be a polynomial of degree four in the degree of the system. The strategy of proof brings variational techniques into the differential-system field by transforming the task of counting limit cycles into counting critical points for a certain smooth, non-negative functional, through Morse inequalities, for which limit cycles are global minimizers. We thus solve the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem providing a uniform upper bound for the number of limit cycles which only depends on the degree of the polynomial differential system. We would like to highlight that the bound is sharp for quadratic systems yielding a maximum of four limit cycles for such subclass of differential systems.</description>

      <title>Exploration of billiards with Keplerian potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of elliptic billiards with a Keplerian potential inside, considering two cases: a reflective one, where the particle reflects elastically on the boundary, and a refractive one, where the particle can cross the billiard's boundary entering a region with a harmonic potential. In the latter case the dynamics is therefore given by concatenations of inner and outer arcs, connected by a refraction law. In recent papers (e.g. arXiv:2105.02108, arXiv:2108.11159, arXiv:2212.01150, arXiv:2110.03376) these billiards have been extensively studied in order to identify which conditions give rise to either regular or chaotic dynamics. In this paper we complete the study by analysing the non focused reflective case, thus complementing the results obtained in arXiv:2110.03376 in the focused one. We then analyse the focused and non focused refractive case, where no results on integrability are known except for the centred circular case, by providing an extensive numerical analysis. We present also a theoretical result regarding the linear stability of homothetic equilibrium orbits in the reflective case for general ellipses, highlighting the possible presence of bifurcations even in the integrable framework.</description>

Abstract: We study piecewise injective, but not necessarily globally injective, contracting maps on a compact subset of \(\bR^d\). We prove that generically the attractor and the set of discontinuities of such a map are disjoint, and hence the attractor consists of periodic orbits. In addition, we prove that piecewise injective contractions are generically topologically stable.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic models and meromorphic functions in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we describe the construction of logarithmic models for germs of plane singular analytic foliations, both real and complex. A logarithmic model is a germ of closed meromorphic 1-form with simple poles produced upon some specified geometric data: the structure of dicritical (non-invariant) components in the exceptional divisor of its reduction of singularities, a prescribed finite set of separatrices - invariant analytic branches at the origin - and Camacho-Sad indices with respect to these separatrices. As an application, we use logarithmic models in order to construct real and complex germs of meromorphic functions with a given indeterminacy structure and prescribed sets of zeroes and poles. Also, in the real case, logarithmic models are used in order to build germs of analytic vector fields with a given Bendixson's sectorial decomposition of a neighborhood of $0 \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ into hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic sectors. This is carried out in the specific case where all trajectories accumulating to the origin are contained in analytic curves. As a consequence, we can produce real meromorphic functions with a prescribed sectorial decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of stability for non-autonomous Hamiltonian flows on two-dimensional annular surfaces. This notion of stability is designed to capture the sustained twisting of particle trajectories. The main Theorem is applied to establish a number of results that reveal a form of irreversibility in the Euler equations governing the motion of an incompressible and inviscid fluid. In particular, we show that nearby general stable steady states (i) all fluid flows exhibit indefinite twisting (ii) vorticity generically exhibits gradient growth and wandering. We also give examples of infinite time gradient growth for smooth solutions to the SQG equation and of smooth vortex patches that entangle and develop unbounded perimeter in infinite time.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Spectral Clustering on Quantum and Analog Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08486v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-analog algorithm to perform graph clustering that exploits connections between the evolution of dynamical systems on graphs and the underlying graph spectra. This approach constitutes a new class of algorithms that combine emerging quantum and analog platforms to accelerate computations. Our hybrid algorithm is equivalent to spectral clustering and has a computational complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph, compared to $O(N^3)$ scaling on classical computing platforms. The proposed method employs the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) framework on the data generated by Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics that evolves on the manifold induced by the graph Laplacian. In particular, we prove and demonstrate that one can extract the eigenvalues and scaled eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian by evolving Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics on quantum computers followed by DMD computations on analog devices.</description>

      <title>A Generalized L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous L\'{e}vy-Khintchine theorem is a beautiful limiting law for the denominators of the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of a real number. In a recent breakthrough, Cheung and Chevallier (Annales scientifiques de l'ENS, 2024) extended this theorem to higher dimensions. In this paper, we consider multiple generalizations of the definition of the best approximates of a matrix and prove analogues of the L\'{e}vy-Khintchine theorem for all these generalizations. A special case of our theorem answers a question posed by Cheung and Chevallier about L\'{e}vy-Khintchine type theorems for arbitrary norms. Another notable instance of our results resolves a conjecture of Yitwah Cheung. While our findings are new for higher dimensions, even in the one-dimensional case our work is a significant improvement over available results. Notably, we extend the results of Cheung and Chevallier by proving their theorems for any Birkhoff generic point and by permitting the best approximates to satisfy additional geometric and arithmetic conditions. Moreover, our main theorem, from which the above results follow, also extends the recent work of Shapira and Weiss.</description>
