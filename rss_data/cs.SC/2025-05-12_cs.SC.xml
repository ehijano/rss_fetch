      <title>Consequences of the Moosbauer-Poole Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moosbauer and Poole have recently shown that the multiplication of two $5\times 5$ matrices requires no more than 93 multiplications in the (possibly non-commutative) coefficient ring, and that the multiplication of two $6\times 6$ matrices requires no more than 153 multiplications. Taking these multiplication schemes as starting points, we found improved matrix multiplication schemes for various rectangular matrix formats using a flip graph search.</description>

      <title>UniSymNet: A Unified Symbolic Network Guided by Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for automatically discovering mathematical expressions from input data. Mainstream SR algorithms search for the optimal symbolic tree in a vast function space, but the increasing complexity of the tree structure limits their performance. Inspired by neural networks, symbolic networks have emerged as a promising new paradigm. However, most existing symbolic networks still face certain challenges: binary nonlinear operators $\{\times, \div\}$ cannot be naturally extended to multivariate operators, and training with fixed architecture often leads to higher complexity and overfitting. In this work, we propose a Unified Symbolic Network that unifies nonlinear binary operators into nested unary operators and define the conditions under which UniSymNet can reduce complexity. Moreover, we pre-train a Transformer model with a novel label encoding method to guide structural selection, and adopt objective-specific optimization strategies to learn the parameters of the symbolic network. UniSymNet shows high fitting accuracy, excellent symbolic solution rate, and relatively low expression complexity, achieving competitive performance on low-dimensional Standard Benchmarks and high-dimensional SRBench.</description>

      <title>Generalization of semi-regular sequences: Maximal Gr\"{o}bner basis degree, variants of genericness, and related conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the notion of semi-regular sequences, originally proposed by Fr\"oberg, becomes very important not only in Mathematics, but also in Information Science, in particular Cryptology. For example, it is highly expected that randomly generated polynomials form a semi-regular sequence, and based on this observation, secure cryptosystems based on polynomial systems can be devised. In this paper, we deal with a semi-regular sequence and its extension, named a generalized cryptographic semi-regular sequence, and give precise analysis on the complexity of computing a Gr\"obner basis of the ideal generated by such a sequence with help of several regularities of the ideal related to Lazard's bound on maximal Gr\"{o}bner basis degree and other bounds. We also study the genericness of the property that a sequence is semi-regular, and its variants related to Fr\"oberg's conjecture. Moreover, we discuss on the genericness of another important property that the initial ideal is weakly reverse lexicographic, related to Moreno-Soc\'{i}as' conjecture, and show some criteria to examine whether both Fr\"oberg's conjecture and Moreno-Soc\'{i}as' one hold at the same time.</description>
