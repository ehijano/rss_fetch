      <title>A Minimal Framework for Optimizing Vaccination Protocols Targeting Highly Mutable Pathogens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A persistent public health challenge is finding immunization schemes that are effective in combating highly mutable pathogens such as HIV and influenza viruses. To address this, we analyze a simplified model of affinity maturation, the Darwinian evolutionary process B cells undergo during immunization. The vaccination protocol dictates selection forces that steer affinity maturation to generate antibodies. We focus on determining the optimal selection forces exerted by a generic time-dependent vaccination protocol to maximize production of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can protect against a broad spectrum of pathogen strains. The model lends itself to a path integral representation and operator approximations within a mean-field limit, providing guiding principles for optimizing time-dependent vaccine-induced selection forces to enhance bnAb generation. We compare our analytical mean-field results with the outcomes of stochastic simulations and discuss their similarities and differences.</description>

      <title>Inertia and Activity: Spiral transitions in semi-flexible, self-avoiding polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional, tangentially active, semi-flexible, self-avoiding polymer to find a dynamical re-entrant transition between motile open chains and spinning achiral spirals with increasing activity. Utilizing probability distributions of the turning number, we ascertain the comparative stability of the spiral structure and present a detailed phase diagram within the activity inertia plane. The onset of spiral formation at low activity levels is governed by a torque balance and is independent of inertia. At higher activities, however, inertial effects lead to spiral destabilization, an effect absent in the overdamped limit. We further delineate alterations in size and shape by analyzing the end-to-end distance distribution and the radius of gyration tensor. The Kullback-Leibler divergence from equilibrium distributions exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with activity, reaching a peak at the most compact spirals characterized by the most persistent spinning. As inertia increases, this divergence from equilibrium diminishes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying cell cycle regulation by tissue crowding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatiotemporal coordination and regulation of cell proliferation is fundamental in many aspects of development and tissue maintenance. Cells have the ability to adapt their division rates in response to mechanical constraints, yet we do not fully understand how cell proliferation regulation impacts cell migration phenomena. Here, we present a minimal continuum model of cell migration with cell cycle dynamics, which includes density-dependent effects and hence can account for cell proliferation regulation. By combining minimal mathematical modelling, Bayesian inference, and recent experimental data, we quantify the impact of tissue crowding across different cell cycle stages in epithelial tissue expansion experiments. Our model suggests that cells sense local density and adapt cell cycle progression in response, during G1 and the combined S/G2/M phases, providing an explicit relationship between each cell cycle stage duration and local tissue density, which is consistent with several experimental observations. Finally, we compare our mathematical model predictions to different experiments studying cell cycle regulation and present a quantitative analysis on the impact of density-dependent regulation on cell migration patterns. Our work presents a systematic approach for investigating and analysing cell cycle data, providing mechanistic insights into how individual cells regulate proliferation, based on population-based experimental measurements.</description>
