      <title>Sensitivity and Hamming graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $m\geq 3$ we show that the Hamming graph $H(n,m)$ admits an imbalanced partition into $m$ sets, each inducing a subgraph of low maximum degree. This improves previous results by Tandya and by Potechin and Tsang, and disproves the Strong $m$-ary Sensitivity Conjecture of Asensio, Garc\'ia-Marco, and Knauer. On the other hand, we prove their weaker $m$-ary Sensitivity Conjecture by showing that the sensitivity of any $m$-ary function is bounded from below by a polynomial expression in its degree.</description>

      <title>The index of unbalanced signed complete graphs whose negative-edge-induced subgraph is ${K}_{2,2}$-minor free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma=(K_n,H^-)$ be a signed complete graph with the negative edges induced subgraph $H$. According to the properties of the negative-edge-induced subgraph, characterizing the extremum problem of the index of the signed complete graph is a concern in signed graphs. A graph $G$ is called $H$-minor free if $G$ has no minor which is isomorphic to $H$. In this paper, we characterize the extremal signed complete graphs that achieve the maximum and the second maximum index when $H$ is a $K_{2,2}$-minor free spanning subgraph of $K_n$.</description>

      <title>Ordinary and spectral extremal problems on vertex disjoint copies of even fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{ex}(n, F)$ and $\mathrm{spex}(n, F)$ be the maximum size and spectral radius among all $F$-free graphs with fixed order $n$, respectively. A fan is a graph $P_1\vee P_{s}$ (join of a vertex and a path of order $s$) for $s\ge 3$, and it is called an even fan if $s$ is even. In this paper, we study $\mathrm{ex}(n,t(P_1\vee P_{2k}))$, $\mathrm{spex}(n,t(P_1\vee P_{2k}))$ with $t\ge 1$ and $k\ge 3$ and characterize the corresponding extremal graphs for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>A Littlewood-type identity for Robbins polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a generalization of the Littlewood identity, both sides of which are related to alternating sign matrices. The classical Littlewood identity establishes a nice product formula for the sum of all Schur polynomials. Compared to the classical identity, Schur polynomials are replaced by so-called modified Robbins polynomials. These polynomials are a generalization of Schur polynomials and enumerate down-arrowed monotone triangles, and thus also alternating sign matrices. As an additional factor on the other side of the identity, we have a Pfaffian formula which we interpret in terms of the partition function of six-vertex model configurations corresponding to diagonally symmetric alternating sign matrices.</description>

      <title>An improved $L^2$ restriction theorem in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mockenhaupt and Tao (Duke 2004) proved a finite field analogue of the Stein--Tomas restriction theorem, establishing a range of $q$ for which $L^q\to L^2$ restriction estimates hold for a given measure $\mu$ on a vector space over a finite field. Their result is expressed in terms of exponents that describe uniform bounds on the measure and its Fourier transform. We generalise this result by replacing the uniform bounds on the Fourier transform with suitable $L^p$ bounds, and we show that our result improves upon the Mockenhaupt--Tao range in many cases. We also provide a number of applications of our result, including to Sidon sets and Hamming varieties.</description>

      <title>Fourier analytic properties of Kakeya sets in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a Kakeya set in a vector space over a finite field of size $q$ always supports a probability measure whose Fourier transform is bounded by $q^{-1}$ for all non-zero frequencies. We show that this bound is sharp in all dimensions at least 2. In particular, this provides a new and self-contained proof that a Kakeya set in dimension 2 has size at least $q^2/2$ (which is asymptotically sharp). We also establish analogous results for sets containing $k$-planes in a given set of orientations.</description>

      <title>Regular 3-polytopes of type $\{n,n\}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each integer \( n \geq 3 \), we construct a self-dual regular 3-polytope \( \mathcal{P} \) of type \( \{n, n\} \) with \( 2^n n \) flags, resolving two foundamental open questions on the existence of regular polytopes with certain Schl\"afli types. The automorphism group \( \operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{P}) \) is explicitly realized as the semidirect product \( \mathbb{F}_2^{n-1} \rtimes D_{2n} \), where \( D_{2n} \) is the dihedral group of order \( 2n \), with a complete presentation for \( \operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{P}) \) is provided. This advances the systematic construction of regular polytopes with prescribed symmetries.</description>

      <title>Planarity of Mycielski-like graph expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, we define its great shadow $S(G)$ as a construction that duplicates each vertex $v$ in $G$ and sets this duplicated vertex adjacent to $v$ and all neighbors of $v$. Great graph shadows arise naturally in the routing of diode-and-switch circuits for computer keyboards, and are closely related to the Mycielski operation. These diode-and-switch circuits can be routed on a single-sided printed-circuit board if and only if the corresponding great shadow is planar. In this paper, we characterize all graphs with planar great shadows. Such graphs are always bipartite cactus graphs.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fermat-Weber Points over Bergman Fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set $[p]:= \{1, \ldots , p\}$, it is well known that the space of all ultrametrics on $[p]$ is the Bergman fan associated to the matroid underlying the complete graph of the vertex set $[p]$. Lin et al.~showed that the set of tropical Fermat-Weber points might not be contained in the space of ultrametrics on $[p]$ even if all input data points are in the space. Here we consider a more general set up and we focus on Fermat-Weber points with respect to the tropical metric over the Bergman fan associated with a matroid with the ground set of $q$ elements. We show that there always exists a Fermat-Weber point in the Bergman fan for data in the Bergman fan and we describe explicitly the set of all Fermat-Weber points in the Bergman fan. Then we introduce the natural extension of the safety radius introduced by Atteson to the set of Fermat-Weber points in the Bergman fan of a matroid.</description>

      <title>Realizations of homology classes and projection areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between convex geometry and algebraic geometry has deep historical roots, tracing back to classical works in enumerative geometry. In this paper, we continue this theme by studying two interconnected problems regarding projections of geometric objects in four-dimensional spaces:
  (1) Let $A$ be a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the areas of the six coordinate projections of $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative real numbers can arise in this way?
  (2) Let $S$ be an irreducible surface in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the degrees of the six coordinate projections from $S$ to $(\mathbb{P}^1)^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative integers can arise in this way?
  We show that these questions are governed by the Pl\"ucker relations for the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(2,4)$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_2$. We extend our analysis by determining the homology classes in $(\mathbb{P}^m)^n$ proportional to the fundamental classes of irreducible algebraic surfaces, resolving the algebraic Steenrod problem in this setting. Our results lead to several conjectures on realizable homology classes in smooth projective varieties and on the projection volumes of convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Sign patterns which require or allow the strong multiplicity property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of sign patterns that require or allow the non-symmetric strong multiplicity property (nSMP). We show that all cycle patterns require the nSMP, regardless of the number of nonzero diagonal entries. We present a class of Hessenberg patterns that require the nSMP. We characterize which star sign patterns require, which allow, and which do not allow the nSMP. We show that if a pattern requires distinct eigenvalues, then it requires the nSMP. Further, we characterize the patterns that allow the nSMP as being precisely the set of patterns that allow distinct eigenvalues, a property that corresponds to a simple feature of the associated digraph. We also characterize the sign patterns of order at most three according to whether they require, allow, or do not allow the nSMP.</description>

      <title>The maximal rank of a string group generated by involutions for alternating groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A string group generated by involutions, or SGGI, is a pair $\Gamma=(G, S)$, where $G$ is a group and $S=\{\rho_0,\ldots, \rho_{r-1}\}$ is an ordered set of involutions generating $G$ and satisfying the commuting property: $$\forall i,j\in\{0,\ldots, r-1\}, \;|i-j|\ne 1\Rightarrow (\rho_i\rho_j)^2=1.$$ When $S$ is an independent set, the rank of $\Gamma$ is the cardinality of $S$.
  We determine an upper bound for the rank of an SGGI over the alternating group of degree $n$. Our bound is tight when $n\equiv 0,1,4\pmod 5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give the values of a certain kind of $q$-multiple zeta functions at roots of unity. Various multiple zeta values have been proposed and studied by many researchers, but these multiple zeta values naturally arise from generalizations of Stirling numbers. It is interesting, but by no means easy, to show the values explicitly in certain cases. We give explicit formulas by using Bell polynomials, determinants, $r$-Stirling numbers, etc.</description>

      <title>Valuative independence and cluster theta reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that theta functions constructed from positive scattering diagrams satisfy valuative independence. That is, for certain valuations $\operatorname{val}_{v}$, we have $\operatorname{val}_v(\sum_u c_u \vartheta_u)=\min_{c_u\neq 0} \operatorname{val}_v(\vartheta_u)$. As applications, we prove linear independence of theta functions with specialized coefficients and characterize when theta functions for cluster varieties are unchanged by the unfreezing of an index. This yields a general gluing result for theta functions from moduli of local systems on marked surfaces. We then prove that theta functions for cluster varieties satisfy a symmetry property called theta reciprocity: briefly, $\operatorname{val}_v(\vartheta_u)=\operatorname{val}_u(\vartheta_v)$. For this we utilize a new framework called a "seed datum" for understanding cluster-type varieties. One may apply valuative independence and theta reciprocity together to identify theta function bases for global sections of line bundles on partial compactifications of cluster varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.09449v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kim and Vu made the following conjecture (\textit{Advances in Mathematics}, 2004): if $d\gg \log n$, then the random $d$-regular graph $G(n,d)$ can be ``sandwiched'' between $G(n,p_*)$ and $G(n,p^*)$ where $p_*$ and $p^*$ are both asymptotically equal to $d/n$.
  This famous conjecture was previously proved for all $d\gg (n\log n)^{3/4}$.
  In this paper, we confirm the conjecture when $d \gg \log^4 n$. We also extend this result to near-regular degree sequences.</description>

Abstract: Of a given bipartite graph $G = (V, E)$, it is elementary to construct a bipartition in time $O(|V| + |E|)$. For a given $k$-graph $H = H^{(k)}$ with $k \geq 3$ fixed, Lov\'asz proved that deciding whether $H$ is bipartite is NP-complete. Let $\mathcal{B}_n$ denote the collection of all $[n]$-vertex bipartite $k$-graphs. We construct, of a given $H \in \mathcal{B}_n$, a bipartition in time averaging $O(n^k)$ over the class $\mathcal{B}_n$. We provide two proofs of our result. When $k = 3$, this result expedites one of Person and Schacht.</description>

      <title>Maximal number of subword occurrences in a word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the number of occurrences of subwords (non-consecutive sub-sequences) in a given word. We first define the notion of subword entropy of a given word that measures the maximal number of occurrences among all possible subwords. We then give upper and lower bounds of minimal subword entropy for words of fixed length in a fixed alphabet, and also showing that minimal subword entropy per letter has a limit value. A better upper bound of minimal subword entropy for a binary alphabet is then given by looking at certain families of periodic words. We also give some conjectures based on experimental observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of maps from $S_n \to S_n$ we call fixed point homing shuffles. These maps generalize a few known problems such as Conway's Topswops, and a card shuffling process studied by Gweneth McKinley. We show that the iterates of these homing shuffles always converge, and characterize the set $U_n$ of permutations that no homing shuffle sorts. We also study a homing shuffle that sorts anything not in $U_n$, and find how many iterations it takes to converge in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Geometric view of interval poset permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent study by Tenner, the concept of the interval poset of a permutation is introduced to effectively represent all intervals and their inclusions within a permutation. This research presents a new geometric viewpoint on these interval posets. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of interval posets for permutations of size $n$ and a specific subset of dissections of a convex polygon with $n+1$ sides. Through this correspondence, we investigate various intriguing subsets of interval posets and uncover their connections to particular polygon dissections.</description>

      <title>Totally odd immersions of complete graphs in graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The counterexamples that Catlin used to disprove Haj\'os' conjecture (that every graph $G$ contains a subdivision of $K_{\chi(G)}$) are the lexicographic product of cliques and cycles. In 1989, Lescure and Meyniel made a conjecture that is a weakening of Haj\'os' and that remains open: every graph contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$. Can minimal counterexamples to this conjecture be produced through graph products? Collins, Heenehan, and McDonald recently gave a negative answer to this question for the lexicographic and Cartesian product. We consider a strengthening of the Lescure and Meyniel conjecture, different from that of Haj\'os, based on the notion of totally odd immersions. We study the largest totally odd immersion appearing in the graph product of two graphs. Our results imply that no minimal counterexample to this strengthened conjecture can be obtained from the Cartesian, lexicographic, direct (tensor) or strong product of graphs.</description>

      <title>Counting degree-constrained orientations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of graph orientations under local degree constraints. Given a finite graph $G = (V, E)$ and a family of admissible sets $\{\mathsf P_v \subseteq \mathbb{Z} : v \in V\}$, let $\mathcal N (G; \prod_{v \in V} \mathsf P_v)$ denote the number of orientations in which the out-degree of each vertex $v$ lies in $P_v$. We prove a general duality formula expressing $\mathcal N(G; \prod_{v \in V} \mathsf P_v)$ as a signed sum over edge subsets, involving products of coefficient sums associated with $\{\mathsf P_v\}_{v \in V}$, from a family of polynomials. Our approach employs gauge transformations, a technique rooted in statistical physics and holographic algorithms. We also present a probabilistic derivation of the same identity, interpreting the orientation-generating polynomial as the expectation of a random polynomial product. As applications, we obtain explicit formulas for the number of even orientations and for mixed Eulerian-even orientations on general graphs. Our formula generalizes a result of Borb\'enyi and Csikv\'ari on Eulerian orientations of graphs.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Andrews and El Bachraoui considered the number of integer partitions whose smallest part is repeated exactly $k$ times and the remaining parts are not repeated. They presented several interesting results and posed questions regarding combinatorial proofs for these identities.

      <title>Some Observations about the "Generalized Abundancy Index"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}(\ell,n) \subset S_n^{\ell}$ denote the set of all $\ell$-tuples $(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell})$, for $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell} \in S_n$ satisfying: $\forall i&lt;j$ we have $\pi_i\pi_j=\pi_j\pi_i$. Considering the action of $S_n$ on $[n]=\{1,\dots,n\}$, let $\kappa(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell})$ be equal to the number of orbits of the action of the subgroup $\langle \pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell} \rangle \subset S_n$. There has been interest in the study of the combinatorial numbers $A(\ell,n,k)$ equal to the cardinalities $|\{(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell}) \in \mathcal{A}(\ell,n)\, :\, \kappa(\pi_1,\dots\pi_{\ell})=k\}|$. If one defines $B(\ell,n)=A(\ell,n,1)/(n-1)!$, then it is known that $B(\ell,n) = \sum_{(f_1,\dots,f_{\ell}) \in \mathbb{N}^{\ell}} \mathbf{1}_{\{n\}}(f_1\cdots f_{\ell}) \prod_{r=1}^{\ell-1} f_r^{\ell-r}$. A special case, $\ell=2$, is $B(2,n) = \sum_{d|n} d = \sigma_1(n)$ the sum-of-divisors function. Then $A(2,n,1)/n!=B(2,n)/n$ is called the abundancy index: $\sigma_1(n)/n$. We call $B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ the ``generalized abundancy index.'' Building on work of Abdesselam, using the probability model, we prove that $\lim_{N \to \infty} N^{-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N} B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ equals $\zeta(2)\cdots \zeta(\ell)$. Motivated by this we state a more precise conjecture for the asymptotics of $-\zeta(2) + N^{-1}\sum_{n=1}^{N} (B(2,n)/n)$.</description>

      <title>Limit Profiles for Reversible Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.13437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Teyssier [Tey20] introduced a new method for approximating the distance from equilibrium of a random walk on a group. He used it to study the limit profile for the random transpositions card shuffle. His techniques were restricted to conjugacy-invariant random walks on groups; we derive similar approximation lemmas for random walks on homogeneous spaces and for general reversible Markov chains. We illustrate applications of these lemmas to some famous problems: the $k$-cycle shuffle, improving results of Hough [Hou16] and Berestycki, Schramm and Zeitouni [BSZ11]; the Ehrenfest urn diffusion with many urns, improving results of Ceccherini-Silberstein, Scarabotti and Tolli [CST07]; a Gibbs sampler, which is a fundamental tool in statistical physics, with Binomial prior and hypergeometric posterior, improving results of Diaconis, Khare and Saloff-Coste [DKS08].</description>

      <title>Synchronization of strongly connected partial DFAs and prefix codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.05057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study synchronizing partial DFAs, which extend the classical concept of synchronizing complete DFAs and are a special case of synchronizing unambiguous NFAs. A partial DFA is called synchronizing if it has a word (called a \emph{reset word}) whose action brings a non-empty subset of states to a unique state and is undefined for all other states. The class of strongly connected partial automata is precisely the class of automata recognized prefix codes. While in the general case the problem of checking whether a partial DFA is synchronizing is PSPACE-complete, we show that in the strongly connected case this problem can be efficiently reduced to the same problem for a complete DFA. Using combinatorial, algebraic, and formal languages methods, we develop techniques that relate main synchronization problems for strongly connected partial DFAs to the same problems for complete DFAs. In particular, this includes the \v{C}ern\'{y} and the rank conjectures, the problem of finding a reset word, and upper bounds on the length of the shortest reset words of literal automata of finite prefix codes. We conclude that solving fundamental synchronization problems is equally hard in both models, as an essential improvement of the results for one model implies an improvement for the other.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of the characteristic polynomial for the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the complex Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble, a family of random matrix models introduced by Girko that interpolates between the Ginibre Ensemble and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and such that its empirical spectral measure converges to the uniform measure on an ellipse. We show the convergence in law of its normalised characteristic polynomial outside of this ellipse. Our proof contains two main steps. We first show the tightness of the normalised characteristic polynomial using the link between the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble and Hermite polynomials. This part relies on the uniform control of the Hermite kernel which is derived from the recent work of Akemann, Duits and Molag. In the second step, we identify the limiting object as the exponential of a Gaussian analytic function. The limit expression is derived from the convergence of traces of Chebyshev polynomials of random matrices by the method of moments. These traces of Chebyshev polynomials appear naturally as a kind of centered version, or normal ordering, of the traces of the monomials. This work answers the interpolation problem raised in the work of Bordenave, Chafa{\"i} and the second author of this paper for the integrable case of the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble and is therefore a fist step towards the conjectured universality of this result.</description>

Abstract: This paper contains two main results. First, we provide combinatorial branching rules for $\text{GL}_n \downarrow \text{O}_n$ and $\text{GL}_{2n} \downarrow \text{Sp}_{2n}$ extending the Littlewood restriction rules. Second, we use these branching rules and the combinatorics of $\text{GL}_n$-crystals to derive a formula for the graded multiplicity of a $K$-type in the regular functions on the $K$-nilpotent cone for $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$, $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{C})$ and $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{H})$. Due to work of Schmid and Vilonen, these graded multiplicities determine the Hodge $K$-character of the spherical principal series with infinitesimal character 0.</description>

      <title>Edge-Disjoint Spanning Trees on Star-Product Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A star-product operation may be used to create large graphs from smaller factor graphs. Network topologies based on star-products demonstrate several advantages including low-diameter, high scalability, modularity and others. Many state-of-the-art diameter-2 and -3 topologies~(Slim Fly, Bundlefly, PolarStar etc.) can be represented as star products.
  In this paper, we explore constructions of edge-disjoint spanning trees~(EDSTs) in star-product topologies. EDSTs expose multiple parallel disjoint pathways in the network and can be leveraged to accelerate collective communication, enhance fault tolerance and network recovery, and manage congestion.
  Our EDSTs have provably maximum or near-maximum cardinality which amplifies their benefits. We further analyze their depths and show that for one of our constructions, all trees have order of the depth of the EDSTs of the factor graphs, and for all other constructions, a large subset of the trees have that depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general framework for multi-type interacting particle systems on graphs, where particles move one at a time by random walk steps, different types may have different speeds, and may interact, possibly randomly, when they meet. We study the equilibrium time of the process, by which we mean the number of steps taken until no further interactions can occur. Under a rather general framework, we obtain high probability upper and lower bounds on the equilibrium time that match up to a constant factor and are of order $n\log n$ if there are order $n$ vertices and particles. We also obtain similar results for the balanced two-type annihilation model of chemical reactions; here, the balanced case (equal density of types) does not fit into our general framework and makes the analysis considerably more difficult. Our models do not admit any exact solution as for integrable systems or the duality approach available for some other particle systems, so we develop a variety of combinatorial tools for comparing processes in the absence of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture and big Ramsey degrees of structures admitting finite monomorphic decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a countable structure admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if so does every monomorphic part in its minimal monomorphic decomposition. The necessary prerequisite for this result is the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees: a countable monomorphic structure has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if it is chainable by a chain with finite big Ramsey degrees. Interestingly, both characterizations require deep structural properties of chains. Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture (actually, its positive resolution due to Laver) is instrumental in the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, while the analysis of big Ramsey combinatorics of structures admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition requires a product Ramsey theorem for big Ramsey degrees. We find this last result particularly intriguing because big Ramsey degrees misbehave notoriously when it comes to general product statements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative probabilistic proof for the sharp Assouad--Nagata dimension bound of a doubling metric space. In addition, we explore some partial rigidity results and applications to scalar curvature. A significant technical tool in our argument is the concept of padded decomposition, which originates in computer science and has been extended to general separable metric spaces by us. Along the way, we extend the sharp upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of graphs with polynomial growth to noncollapsed locally compact metric measure spaces with polynomial volume growth. This sheds light on broader applications of probabilistic methods in metric geometry.</description>

Abstract: We define a positive state sum for webs "of type D". These webs are graphs which mimic morphisms in the category of finite-dimensional quantum so(2N)-modules. From the state sum, we derive an invariant of framed unoriented links. After giving explicit details about some intertwiners in the category of quantum so(2N)-modules, we relate our state-sum link invariant with Reshetikhin--Turaev's invariant associated with quantum so(2N).</description>
