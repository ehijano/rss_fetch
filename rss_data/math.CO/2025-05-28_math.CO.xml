      <title>Strong edge-coloring of graphs with maximum edge weight seven</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is an edge-coloring such that any two edges of distance at most two receive distinct colors. The minimum number of colors we need in order to give $G$ a strong edge-coloring is called the strong chromatic index of $G$, denoted by $\chi_s'(G)$. The maximum edge weight of $G$ is defined to be $\max\{d(u)+d(v):\ uv\in E(G)\}$. In this paper, using the discharging method, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with maximum edge weight $7$ and maximum average degree less than $\frac{28}{9}$, then $\chi_s'(G)\le 13$.</description>

      <title>Some results on the k-strong parity property in a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ has the $k$-strong parity property if for any $X\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|$ even, $G$ contains a spanning subgraph $F$ with $d_F(u)\equiv1$ (mod 2) for each $u\in X$ and $d_F(v)\in\{k,k+2,k+4,\ldots\}$ for each $v\in V(G)\setminus X$, where $k\geq2$ is an even integer. Kano and Matsumura proposed a characterization for a graph with the $k$-strong parity property (M. Kano, H. Matsumura, Odd-even factors of graphs, Graphs Combin. 41 (2025) 55). In this paper, we first give a size condition for a graph to have the $k$-strong parity property. Then we establish a signless Laplacian spectral radius condition to guarantee that a graph has the $k$-strong parity property.</description>

      <title>Proof of a Conjecture on the Growth of the Maximal Resistance Distance in a Linear 3--Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barret, Evans, and Francis conjectured that if $G$ is the straight linear 3-tree with $n$ vertices and $H$ is the straight linear 3-tree with $n+1$ vertices then
  \[\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} r_{H} (1, n+1) - r_G(1,n) = \frac{1}{14},\] where $r_G(u,v)$ and $r_H(u,v)$ are the resistance distance between vertices $u$ and $v$ in graphs $G$ and $H$ respectively. In this paper, we prove the conjecture by looking at the determinants of deleted Laplacian matrices. The proof uses a Laplace expansion method on a family of determinants to determine the underlying recursion this family satisfies and then uses routine linear algebra methods to obtain an exact Binet formula for the $n$-th term.</description>

      <title>On the set-coloring Ramsey numbers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{set-coloring Ramsey number} $\mathrm{R}_{r, s}(G_1,G_2,...,G_r)$ is the least $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that every coloring $\chi: E\left(K_n\right) \rightarrow\binom{[r]}{s}$ contains a monochromatic copy of $G_i$, that is, a color $i \in[r]$ such that $i \in \chi(e)$ for every $e \in E(G_i)$. If $G_1=G_2=\cdots=G_r=G$, then we write $\mathrm{R}_{r,s}(G)$ for short. In 2022, Le asked to find lower and upper bounds for $\mathrm{R}_{s, t}(G)$ with various kinds of graphs $G$ such as stars, paths, cycles, etc. In this paper, we obtain exact values or bounds for the set-coloring Ramsey numbers of stars, paths, matchings, etc. By Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma, we give a lower bound for the set-coloring Ramsey number for general graphs.</description>

      <title>Missing faces of neighborly and nearly neighborly polytopes and spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $(d-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex $\Delta$ and $1\leq i\leq d$, let $f_{i-1}$ be the number of $(i-1)$-faces of $\Delta$ and $m_i$ be the number of missing $i$-faces of $\Delta$. In the nineties, Kalai asked for a characterization of the $m$-numbers of simplicial polytopes and spheres -- a problem that remains wide open to this day. Here, we study the $m$-numbers of nearly neighborly and neighborly polytopes and spheres. Specifically, for $d\geq 4$, we obtain a lower bound on $m_{\lfloor d/2\rfloor}$ in terms of $f_0$ and $f_{\lfloor d/2\rfloor-1}$ in the class of all $(\lfloor d/2\rfloor-1)$-neighborly $(d-1)$-spheres. For neighborly spheres, we (almost) characterize the $m$-numbers of $2$-neighborly $4$-spheres, and we show that, for all odd values of $k$, there exists an infinite family of neighborly simplicial $2k$-spheres with $m_{k+1}=0$. Along the way, we provide a simple numerical condition based on the $m$-numbers that allows to establish non-polytopality of some neighborly odd-dimensional spheres.</description>

      <title>Linear-Time Computation of the Frobenius Normal Form for Symmetric Toeplitz Matrices via Graph-Theoretic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a linear-time algorithm for computing the Frobenius normal form (FNF) of symmetric Toeplitz matrices by utilizing their inherent structural properties through a graph-theoretic approach. Previous results of the authors established that the FNF of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix is explicitly represented as a direct sum of symmetric irreducible Toeplitz matrices, each corresponding to connected components in an associated weighted Toeplitz graph. Conventional matrix decomposition algorithms, such as Storjohann's method (1998), typically have cubic-time complexity. Moreover, standard graph component identification algorithms, such as breadth-first or depth-first search, operate linearly with respect to vertices and edges, translating to quadratic-time complexity solely in terms of vertices for dense graphs like weighted Toeplitz graphs. Our method uniquely leverages the structural regularities of weighted Toeplitz graphs, achieving linear-time complexity strictly with respect to vertices through two novel reductions: the \alpha-type reduction, which eliminates isolated vertices, and the \beta-type reduction, applying residue class contractions to achieve rapid structural simplifications while preserving component structure. These reductions facilitate an efficient recursive decomposition process that yields linear-time performance for both graph component identification and the resulting FNF computation. This work highlights how structured combinatorial representations can lead to significant computational gains in symbolic linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Existence of a Sidon set for the distinct distance constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight a certain compactness of Sidon sets and $B_2[g]$-sets and provide several applications. Notably, we prove the existence of such sets that maximize certain functions. In particular, we show the existence of a Sidon set whose reciprocal sum is equal to the distinct distance constant, which answers a question from Guy and Zhang. We also improve the best known upper bound for this constant.</description>

      <title>Circles and line segments as independence attractors of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By an independent set in a simple graph $G$, we mean a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices in $G$. The independence polynomial of $G$ is defined as $I_G(z)=a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2+\cdots+a_\alpha z^{\alpha}$, where $a_i$ is the number of independent sets in $G$ with cardinality $i$ and $\alpha$ is the cardinality of a largest independent set in $G$, known as the independence number of $G$. Let $G^m$ denote the $m$-times lexicographic product of $G$ with itself. The independence attractor of $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{A}(G)$, is defined as $\mathcal{A}(G) = \lim_{m\rightarrow \infty} \{z: I_{G^m}(z)=0\}$, where the limit is taken with respect to the Hausdorff metric on the space of all compact subsets of the plane. This paper deals with independence attractors that are topologically simple. It is shown that $\mathcal{A}(G)$ can never be a circle. If $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is a line segment then it is proved that the line segment is $[-\frac{4}{k}, 0]$ for some $k \in \{1, 2, 3, 4 \}$. Examples of graphs with independence number four are provided whose independence attractors are line segments.</description>

      <title>A refined view of a curious identity for partitions into odd parts with designated summands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2002, Andrews, Lewis, and Lovejoy introduced the combinatorial objects which they called partitions with designated summands. These are constructed by taking unrestricted integer partitions and designating exactly one of each occurrence of a part. In the same work, they also considered the restricted partitions with designated summands wherein all parts must be odd, and they denoted the corresponding function by $\mathrm{PDO}(n)$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-strongly regular graphs on the flags of symmetric designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper was inspired by a paper by Blokhuis and Brouwer [Designs, Codes and Cryptography 65, 2012] in which a definition of a graph on the flags of a biplane is given, and they prove that the graph corresponding to the unique $(11,5,2)$-biplane is determined by its spectrum. It is also inspired by the different definition of flag-graph seen in the context of maps and abstract polytopes. Here we use this definition for $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBDs, and prove that if the design is symmetric then the graph is quasi-strongly regular. We will also use the definition given by Blokhuis and Brouwer for the case of biplanes and prove that this too, is a QSRG, (with different parameters). We investigate whether these graphs are determined by their spectra for some of the known biplanes.</description>

Abstract: Let $G_{n,p}^{[\kappa]}$ denote the space of $n$-vertex edge coloured graphs, where each edge occurs independently with probability $p$. The colour of each existing edge is chosen independently and uniformly at random from the set $[\kappa]$. We consider the threshold for the existence of rainbow colored copies of a spanning subgraph $H$. We provide lower bounds on $p$ and $\kappa$ sufficient to prove the existence of such copies w.h.p.</description>

      <title>On Distinguishing Graphs and Cost Number using Automorphism Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \textit{distinguishing coloring} of a graph is a vertex coloring such that only the identity automorphism of the graph preserves the coloring. A \textit{2-distinguishable graph} is a graph which can be distinguished using 2 colors. The \textit{cost} $\rho(G)$ of a 2-distinguishable graph is the smallest size of a color set of a distinguishing coloring of $G$. The \textit{determining number} of a graph, $Det(G)$, is the minimum number of nodes, which if fixed by a coloring, would ensure that the coloring distinguishes the entire graph.
  Boutin (J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 85: 161-171, 2013) posed an open problem which asks if $\rho(G)$ and $Det(G)$ can be arbitrarily far apart. It is trivial that it cannot be so for the case $Det(G) = 1$ but the answer was unknown for $Det(G) \geq 2$. We solve this problem for the case $Det(G) = 2$. We show that for the case $Det(G) = 2$, that not only is the cost bounded but in fact it takes small values with $\rho(G) = 2, \ 3$ or $4$. In order to establish this, the concept of the \textit{automorphism representation} of a graph is developed. Graphs having equivalent automorphism representations implies that they have the same distinguishing number (note that just having isomorphic automorphism groups is not enough for this to hold). This prompts a factoring of graphs by which two graphs are \textit{distinguishably equivalent} iff they have equivalent automorphism representations.</description>

      <title>Structure-biased Maker-Breaker Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical Maker-Breaker games on graphs, Maker and Breaker take turns claiming edges; Maker's goal is to claim all of some structure (e.g., a spanning tree, Hamilton cycle, etc.), while Breaker aims to stop her. The standard question considered is how powerful a Breaker Maker can defeat; i.e., for the $(1:b)$-biased game where Breaker takes $b$ edges per turn, how large can $b$ be for Maker to still have a winning strategy, for various possible goal sets?
  We introduce a variant of this question in which Breaker is required to choose their multiple edges as the edges of (a subgraph of) a given structure (e.g., a matching, clique, etc.) on each turn. We establish the order of magnitude of the threshold biases for triangle games, connectivity games, and Hamiltonicity games under clique, matching, and star biases respectively. We conclude that in many cases structure imposes major obstruction to Breaker, opening up a set of games whose strategies deviate from the classical biased Maker-Breaker game strategies, and shedding light on the types of Breaker strategies that may or may not work to prove tighter bounds in the classical setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many intriguing questions in extremal graph theory that are well-understood in the undirected setting and yet remain elusive for digraphs. A natural instance of such a problem was recently studied by Hons, Klimo\v{s}ov\'{a}, Kucheriya, Mik\v{s}an\'{i}k, Tkadlec and Tyomkyn: What are the digraphs that have to appear as a subgraph in all digraphs of sufficiently large minimum out-degree? Hons et al. showed that all such digraphs must be oriented forests with a specific structure, and conjectured that vice-versa all oriented forests with this specific structure appear in any digraph of sufficiently large minimum out-degree. In this paper, we confirm their conjecture.</description>

      <title>Pushing Cops and Robber on Graphs of Maximum Degree 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textsc{Cops and Robber} is a game played on graphs where a set of \textit{cops} aim to \textit{capture} the position of a single \textit{robber}. The main parameter of interest in this game is the \textit{cop number}, which is the minimum number of cops that are sufficient to guarantee the capture of the robber.
  In a directed graph $\overrightarrow{G}$, the \textit{push} operation on a vertex $v$ reverses the orientation of all arcs incident on $v$. We consider a variation of classical \textsc{Cops and Robber} on oriented graphs, where in its turn, each cop can either move to an out-neighbor of its current vertex or push some vertex of the graph, whereas, the robber can move to an adjacent vertex in its turn. [Das et al., CALDAM, 2023] introduced this variant and established that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a subcubic graph, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy. We extend these results to establish that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a $3$-degenerate graph, or of a graph with maximum degree $4$, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy.</description>

      <title>Colouring Probe $H$-Free Graphs</title>

Abstract: The NP-complete problems Colouring and k-Colouring $(k\geq 3$) are well studied on $H$-free graphs, i.e., graphs that do not contain some fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph. We research to what extent the known polynomial-time algorithms for $H$-free graphs can be generalized if we only know some of the edges of the input graph. We do this by considering the classical probe graph model introduced in the early nineties. For a graph $H$, a partitioned probe $H$-free graph $(G,P,N)$ consists of a graph $G=(V,E)$, together with a set $P\subseteq V$ of probes and an independent set $N=V\setminus P$ of non-probes, such that $G+F$ is $H$-free for some edge set $F\subseteq \binom{N}{2}$. We first fully classify the complexity of Colouring on partitioned probe $H$-free graphs and show that this dichotomy is different from the known dichotomy of Colouring for $H$-free graphs. Our main result is a dichotomy of $3$-Colouring for partitioned probe $P_t$-free graphs: we prove that the problem is polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 5$ but NP-complete if $t\geq 6$. In contrast, $3$-Colouring on $P_t$-free graphs is known to be polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 7$ and quasi polynomial-time solvable for $t\geq 8$.</description>

Abstract: The study of sums of finite sets of integers has mostly concentrated on sets with small sumsets (Freiman's theorem and related work) and on sets with large sumsets (Sidon sets and $B_h$-sets). This paper considers the sets ${\mathcal R}_{\mathbf Z}(h,k)$ and ${\mathcal R}_{{\mathbf Z}^n}(h,k)$ of all sizes of $h$-fold sums of sets of $k$ integers or of $k$ lattice points, and the geometric and computational complexity of the sets ${\mathcal R}_{\mathbf Z}(h,k)$ and ${\mathcal R}_{{\mathbf Z}^n}(h,k)$.</description>

      <title>Counting Reciprocal Hyperbolic Elements in Hecke Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reciprocal geodesic on a (2,k, $\infty$) Hecke surface is a geodesic loop based at an even order cone point p traversing its path an even number of times. Associated to each reciprocal geodesic is the conjugacy class of a hyperbolic element in the (2,k,$\infty$) Hecke group whose axis passes through a cone point that projects to p. Such an element is called a reciprocal hyperbolic element based at p.
  In this paper, we determine the asymptotic growth rate and limiting constant (in terms of word length) of the number of primitive conjugacy classes of reciprocal hyperbolic elements in a Hecke group.</description>

      <title>Structure and generation of crossing-critical graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1803.01931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study c-crossing-critical graphs, which are the minimal graphs that require at least c edge-crossings when drawn in the plane. For c=1 there are only two such graphs without degree-2 vertices, K_5 and K_3,3, but for any fixed c&gt;1 there exist infinitely many c-crossing-critical graphs. It has been previously shown that c-crossing-critical graphs have bounded path-width and contain only a bounded number of internally disjoint paths between any two vertices. We expand on these results, providing a more detailed description of the structure of crossing-critical graphs. On the way towards this description, we prove a new structural characterisation of plane graphs of bounded path-width. Then we show that every c-crossing-critical graph can be obtained from a c-crossing-critical graph of bounded size by replicating bounded-size parts that already appear in narrow "bands" or "fans" in the graph. This also gives an algorithm to generate all the c-crossing-critical graphs of at most given order n in polynomial time per each generated graph.</description>

      <title>Describing Quasi-Graphic Matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.00489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a revised version of our original paper (arXiv:1808.00489v2) incorporating the corrections published in a corrigendum (arXiv:1808.00489v3). Our main theorem as originally stated was missing the required assumption that matroids should be connected. Those unfamiliar with the original paper will find in this version a complete, correct description of quasi-graphic matroids, sparing them the inconvenience of having to read both the original paper and a separate corrigendum.
  We also present here some new results that do not appear in our original paper nor its corrigendum. These appear in Section 6. Of particular interest to readers familiar with the original paper and its corrigendum may be the following result. Given a matroid and a graph, of the four axioms for quasi-graphic matroids, three may be checked in time polynomial in the size of the ground set, but the fourth axiom in general cannot. It is desirable to have such a check that could be carried out in polynomial time. We provide such an alternative (Theorem 6.20).</description>

      <title>Subgraph probability of random graphs with specified degrees and applications to chromatic number and connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.02216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graphical degree sequence ${\bf d}=(d_1,\ldots, d_n)$, let $G(n, {\bf d})$ denote a uniformly random graph on vertex set $[n]$ where vertex $ i$ has degree $d_i$ for every $1\le i\le n$. We give upper and lower bounds on the joint probability of an arbitrary set of edges in $G(n,{\bf d})$. These upper and lower bounds are approximately what one would get in the configuration model, and thus the analysis in the configuration model can be translated directly to $G(n,{\bf d})$, without conditioning on that the configuration model produces a simple graph. Many existing results of $G(n,{\bf d})$ in the literature can be significantly improved with simpler proofs, by applying this new probabilistic tool. One example we give is about the chromatic number of $G(n,{\bf d})$.
  In another application, we use these joint probabilities to study the connectivity of $G(n,{\bf d})$. When $\Delta^2=o(M)$ where $\Delta$ is the maximum component of ${\bf d}$, we fully characterise the connectivity phase transition of $G(n,{\bf d})$. We also give sufficient conditions for $G(n,{\bf d})$ being connected when $\Delta$ is unrestricted.</description>

      <title>Sperner systems with restricted differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of subsets of $[n]$ and $L$ be a subset of $[n]$. We say $\mathcal{F}$ is an $L$-differencing Sperner system if $|A\setminus B|\in L$ for any distinct $A,B\in\mathcal{F}$. Let $p$ be a prime and $q$ be a power of $p$. Frankl first studied $p$-modular $L$-differencing Sperner systems and showed an upper bound of the form $\sum_{i=0}^{|L|}\binom{n}{i}$. In this paper, we obtain new upper bounds on $q$-modular $L$-differencing Sperner systems using elementary $p$-adic analysis and polynomial method, extending and improving existing results substantially. Moreover, our techniques can be used to derive new upper bounds on subsets of the hypercube with restricted Hamming distances. One highlight of the paper is the first analogue of the celebrated Snevily's theorem in the $q$-modular setting, which results in several new upper bounds on $q$-modular $L$-avoiding $L$-intersecting systems. In particular, we improve a result of Felszeghy, Heged\H{u}s, and R\'{o}nyai, and give a partial answer to a question posed by Babai, Frankl, Kutin, and \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}.</description>

      <title>Reuniting $\chi$-boundedness with polynomial $\chi$-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal F$ of graphs is $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(H)\le f(\omega(H))$ for all induced subgraphs $H$ of a graph in $\mathcal F$. If $f$ can be chosen to be a polynomial, we say that $\mathcal F$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Esperet proposed a conjecture that every $\chi$-bounded class of graphs is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. This conjecture has been disproved; it has been shown that there are classes of graphs that are $\chi$-bounded but not polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Nevertheless, inspired by Esperet's conjecture, we introduce Pollyanna classes of graphs. A class $\mathcal C$ of graphs is Pollyanna if $\mathcal C\cap \mathcal F$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded for every $\chi$-bounded class $\mathcal F$ of graphs. We prove that several classes of graphs are Pollyanna and also present some proper classes of graphs that are not Pollyanna.</description>

      <title>The ascent lattice on Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Stanley lattice defined on Dyck paths of size $n$, cover relations are obtained by replacing a valley $DU$ by a peak $UD$. We investigate a greedy version of this lattice, first introduced by Chenevi\`ere, where cover relations replace a factor $DU^k D$ by $U^kD^2$. By relating this poset to another poset recently defined by Nadeau and Tewari, we prove that this still yields a lattice, which we call the ascent lattice, $L_n$. We then count intervals in $L_n$. Their generating function is found to be algebraic of degree $3$. The proof is based on a recursive decomposition of intervals involving two catalytic parameters. The solution of the corresponding functional equation is inspired by recent work on the enumeration of walks confined to a quadrant. We also consider the order induced in $L_{mn}$ on $m$-Dyck paths, that is, paths in which all ascent lengths are multiples of $m$, and on mirrored $m$-Dyck paths, in which all descent lengths are multiples of $m$. The first poset $L_{m,n}$ is still a lattice for any $m$, while the second poset $L'_{m,n}$ is only a join semilattice when $m&gt;1$. In both cases, the enumeration of intervals is still described by an equation in two catalytic variables. Interesting connections arise with the sylvester congruence of Hivert, Novelli and Thibon, and again with walks confined to a quadrant. We combine the latter connection with probabilistic results to give asymptotic estimates of the number of intervals in both $L_{m,n}$ and $L'_{m,n}$. Their form implies that the generating functions of intervals are no longer algebraic, nor even D-finite, when $m&gt;1$.</description>

Abstract: A rooted arborescence of a directed graph is a spanning tree directed towards a particular vertex. A recent work of Chepuri et al. showed that the arborescences of a covering graph of a directed graph G are closely related to the arborescences of G.

      <description>arXiv:2503.04950v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study representation stability in the sense of Church, Ellenberg, and Farb \cite{FI-module} through the lens of symmetric function theory and the different symmetric function bases. We show that a sequence, $(F_n)_n$, where $F_n$ is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree $n$, has stabilizing Schur coefficients if and only if it has stabilizing monomial coefficients. More generally, we develop a framework for checking when stabilizing coefficients transfer from one symmetric function basis to another. We also see how one may compute representation stable ranges from the monomial expansions of the $F_n$.\parspace
  As applications, we reprove and refine the representation stability of diagonal coinvariant algebras, $DR_n$. We also observe new representation stability phenomena of the Garsia-Haiman modules. This establishes certain stability properties of the modified Macdonald polynomials, $\tilde{H}_{\mu^{(n)}}[X;q,t]$ and the modified $q,t$-Kostka numbers, $\tilde{K}_{\mu^{(n)},\nu[n]}(q,t)$, for arbitrary sequences of partitions with $\mu^{(n)}\vdash n$ and $\mu^{(n)}\subseteq \mu^{(n+1)}$.</description>

      <title>Perfect taxon sampling and fixing taxon traceability: Introducing a class of phylogenetically decisive collections of taxon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3472</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.3472v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetically decisive collections of taxon sets have the property that if trees are chosen for each of their elements, as long as these trees are compatible, the resulting supertree is unique. This means that as long as the trees describing the phylogenetic relationships of the (input) species sets are compatible, they can only be combined into a common supertree in precisely one way. This setting is sometimes also referred to as \enquote{perfect taxon sampling}. While for rooted trees, the decision if a given set of input taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive can be made in polynomial time, the decision problem to determine whether a collection of taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive concerning \emph{unrooted} trees is unfortunately coNP-complete and therefore in practice hard to solve for large instances. This shows that recognizing such sets is often difficult. In this paper, we explain phylogenetic decisiveness and introduce a class of input taxon sets, namely so-called \emph{fixing taxon traceable} sets, which are guaranteed to be phylogenetically decisive and which can be recognized in polynomial time. Using both combinatorial approaches as well as simulations, we compare properties of fixing taxon traceability and phylogenetic decisiveness, e.g., by deriving lower and upper bounds for the number of quadruple sets (i.e., sets of 4-tuples) needed in the input set for each of these properties. In particular, we correct an erroneous lower bound concerning phylogenetic decisiveness from the literature.
  We have implemented the algorithm to determine if a given collection of taxon sets is fixing taxon traceable in \textsf{R} and made our software package \verb+FixingTaxonTraceR+ publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1512.03127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine some flexible notions of constraint satisfaction, observing some relationships between model theoretic notions of universal Horn class membership and robust satisfiability. We show the \texttt{NP}-completeness of $2$-robust monotone 1-in-3 3SAT in order to give very small examples of finite algebras with \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. In particular we give a $3$-element algebra with this property, and solve a widely stated problem by showing that the $6$-element Brandt monoid has \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. These are the smallest possible sizes for a general algebra and a semigroup to exhibit \texttt{NP}-hardness for the membership problem of finite algebras in finitely generated varieties.</description>

      <title>Equivariant K-theory of the space of partial flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Drinfeld style generators and relations to define an algebra $\mathfrak{U}_n$ which is a ``$q=0$'' version of the affine quantum group of $\mathfrak{gl}_n.$ We then use the convolution product on the equivariant $K$-theory of varieties of pairs of partial flags in a $d$-dimensional vector space $V$ to define affine $0$-Schur algebras ${\mathbb S}_0^{\operatorname{aff}}(n,d)$ and to prove that for every $d$ there exists a surjective homomorphism from $\mathfrak{U}_n$ to ${\mathbb S}_0^{\operatorname{aff}}(n,d).$</description>

      <title>Elementary first-order model checking for sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that for subgraph-closed graph classes the first-order model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if the class is nowhere dense [Grohe, Kreutzer, Siebertz, STOC 2014]. However, the dependency on the formula size is non-elementary, and in fact, this is unavoidable even for the class of all trees [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002]. On the other hand, it is known that the dependency is elementary for classes of bounded degree [Frick and Grohe, LICS 2002] as well as for classes of bounded pathwidth [Lampis, ICALP 2023]. In this paper we generalise these results and almost completely characterise subgraph-closed graph classes for which the model checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size. Those are the graph classes for which there exists a number $d$ such that for every $r$, some tree of depth $d$ and size bounded by an elementary function of $r$ is avoided as an $({\leq} r)$-subdivision in all graphs in the class. In particular, this implies that if the class in question excludes a fixed tree as a topological minor, then first-order model checking for graphs in the class is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependency on the formula size.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces in positive geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are lecture notes for five lectures given at MPI Leipzig in May 2024. We study the moduli space M_{0,n} of n distinct points on P^1 as a positive geometry and a binary geometry. We develop mathematical formalism to study Cachazo-He-Yuan's scattering equations and the associated scalar and Yang-Mills amplitudes. We discuss open superstring amplitudes and relations to tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Wreath Macdonald polynomials, quiver varieties, and quasimap counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical.</description>

      <title>Transductions of Graph Classes Admitting Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a quest to thoroughly understand the first-order transduction hierarchy of hereditary graph classes, some questions in particular stand out; such as, what properties hold for graph classes that are first-order transductions of planar graphs (and of similar classes)? When addressing this (so-far wide open) question, we turn to the concept of a product structure - being a subgraph of the strong product of a path and a graph of bounded tree-width, introduced by Dujmovic et al. [JACM 2020]. Namely, we prove that any graph class which is a first-order transduction of a class admitting such product structure, up to perturbations also meets a structural description generalizing the concept of a product structure in a dense hereditary way - the latter concept being introduced just recently by Hlineny and Jedelsky under the name of H-clique-width [MFCS 2024]. Using this characterization, we show that the class of the 3D grids, as well as a class of certain modifications of 2D grids, are not first-order transducible from classes admitting a product structure, and in particular not from the class of planar graphs.</description>
