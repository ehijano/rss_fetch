      <title>Some applications of finite BL-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present an encryption/decryption algorithm which use properties of finite MV-algebras, we proved that there are no commutative and unitary rings R such that Id (R) = L,where L is a finite BL-algebra which is not an MV-algebra and we give a method to generate BL-comets. Moreover, we give a final characterisation of finite BL-algebra and we proved that a finite BL-algebra is a comet or MV-algebras which are not chains.</description>

      <title>Kites and representations of pseudo MV-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of perfect residuated lattices, focussing especially on perfect pseudo MV-algebras. We show that perfect pseudo MV-algebras can be represented as a generalised version of kites of Dvure\v{c}enskij and Kowalski, and that they are categorically equivalent to $\ell$-groups with a distinguished automorphism. We then characterise varieties generated by kites and describe the lattice of these varieties as a complete sublattice of the lattice of perfectly generated varieties of perfect pseudo MV-algebras.</description>

      <title>Splittings in varieties of logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study splittings, or lack of them, in lattices of subvarieties of some logic-related varieties. We present a general lemma, the Non-Splitting Lemma, which when combined with some variety-specific constructions, yields each of our negative results: the variety of commutative integral residuated lattices contains no splittings algebras, and in the varieties of double Heyting algebras, dually pseudocomplemented Heyting algebras and regular double p-algebras the only splitting algebras are the two-element and three-element chains.</description>

      <title>Amenability, Optimal Transport and Abstract Ergodic Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using tools from the theory of optimal transport, we establish several results concerning isometric actions of amenable topological groups with potentially unbounded orbits. Specifically, suppose $d$ is a compatible left-invariant metric on an amenable topological group $G$ with no non-trivial homomorphisms to $\mathbb R$. Then, for every finite subset $E\subseteq G$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, there is a finitely supported probability measure $\beta$ on $G$ such that $$ \max_{g,h\in E}\, {\sf W}(\beta g, \beta h)&lt;\epsilon, $$ where ${\sf W}$ denotes the Wasserstein distance between probability measures on the metric space $(G,d)$. When $d$ is the word metric on a finitely generated group $G$, this strengthens a well known theorem of Reiter and, when $d$ is bounded, recovers a result of Schneider and Thom. Furthermore, when $G$ is locally compact, $\beta$ may be replaced by an appropriate probability density $f\in L^1(G)$.
  Also, when $G\curvearrowright X$ is a continuous isometric action on a metric space, the space of Lipschitz functions on the quotient $X/\!\!/G$ is isometrically isomorphic to a $1$-complemented subspace of the Lipschitz functions on $X$. And, when additionally $G$ is skew-amenable, there is a $G$-invariant contraction $$ \mathfrak {Lip}\, X \overset S\longrightarrow\mathfrak{Lip}(X/\!\!/G) $$ so that $(S\phi\big)\big(\overline{Gx}\big)=\phi(x)$ whenever $\phi$ is constant on every orbit of $G\curvearrowright X$. This latter extends results of Cuth and Doucha from the setting of locally compact or balanced groups.</description>

      <title>Hilbert spaces admit no finitary discrete imaginaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every functor from the category of Hilbert spaces and linear isometric embeddings to the category of sets which preserves directed colimits must be essentially constant on all infinite-dimensional spaces. In other words, every finitary set-valued imaginary over the theory of Hilbert spaces, in a broad signature-independent sense, must be essentially trivial. This extends a result and answers a question by Lieberman--Rosick\'y--Vasey, who showed that no such functor on the supercategory of Hilbert spaces and injective linear contractions can be faithful.</description>

      <title>The double cone group is isomorphic to the archipelago group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture of James W. Cannon and Gregory R. Conner that the fundamental group of the Griffiths double cone space is isomorphic to that of the harmonic archipelago. From this and earlier work in this area, we conclude that the isomorphism class of these groups is quite large and includes groups with a great variety of descriptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper considers computable Folner sequences in computably enumerable amenable groups. We extend some basic results of M. Cavaleri on existence of such sequences to the case of groups where finite generation is not assumed. We also initiate some new directions in this topic, for example complexity of families of effective Folner sequences. Possible extensions of this approach to metric groups are also discussed.
  This paper also contains some unpublished results from the paper of the first author arXiv:1904.02640.</description>

      <title>A characterization of locally ordered ternary relations in terms of digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1917, Huntington and Kline, followed by Huntington in 1924, studied systems of axioms for ternary relations aiming to capture the concepts of linear order (called betwenness) and cycle order, respectively. Among many other properties, they proved there are several independent set of axioms defining either linear order or cycle order. In this work, we consider systems arising from the four common axioms of linear order and cycle order, together with a new axiom F, stating that if a tuple abc is in the relation, then either cba or bca is in the relation as well. Although, at first glace this allows for a much richer type of systems, we prove that these are either of linear order or cycle order type. Our main result is a complete characterization of the finite systems satisfying the set of axioms {B, C, D, F, 2}, where B, C, D and 2 are axioms presented by Huntington. Unlike what happens in the previous situation, with this modification we obtain a larger family of systems which we characterize in terms of digraphs.</description>

      <title>On the theory of exponential integer parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We axiomatize the first-order theories of exponential integer parts of real-closed exponential fields in a language with $2^x$, in a language with a predicate for powers of 2, and in the basic language of ordered rings. In particular, the last theory extends IOpen by sentences expressing the existence of winning strategies in a certain game on integers; we show that it is a proper extension of IOpen, and give upper and lower bounds on the required number of rounds needed to win the game.</description>

      <title>Low$_2$ computably enumerable sets have hyperhypersimple supersets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding question is to characterize the lattice of supersets (modulo finite sets), $\mathcal{L}^*(A)$, of a low$_2$ computably enumerable (c.e.) set. The conjecture is that $\mathcal{L}^*(A)\cong {\mathcal E}^*$. In spite of claims in the literature, this longstanding question/conjecture remains open. We contribute to this problem by solving one of the main test cases. We show that if c.e.\ $A$ is low$_2$ then $A$ has an atomless hyperhypersimple superset. In fact, if $A$ is c.e.\ and low$_2$, then for any $\Sigma_3$-Boolean algebra~$B$ there is some c.e.\ $H\supseteq A$ such that $\mathcal{L}^*(H)\cong B$.</description>

      <title>Encoding argumentation frameworks with set attackers to propositional logic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) have been a useful tool for approximate reasoning. The encoding method is an important approach to formally model $AF$s under related semantics. The aim of this paper is to develop the encoding method from classical Dung's $AF$s ($DAF$s) to $AF$s with set attackers ($AFSA$s) including higher-level argumentation frames ($HLAF$s), Barringer's higher-order $AF$s ($BHAF$s), frameworks with sets of attacking arguments ($SETAF$s) and higher-order set $AF$s ($HSAF$s). Regarding syntactic structures, we propose the $HSAF$s where the target of an attack is either an argument or an attack and the sources are sets of arguments and attacks. Regarding semantics, we translate $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s under respective complete semantics to {\L}ukasiewicz's 3-valued propositional logic system ($PL_3^L$). Furthermore, we propose complete semantics of $BHAF$s and $HSAF$s by respectively generalizing from $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s, and then translate to the $PL_3^L$. Moreover, for numerical semantics of $AFSA$s, we propose the equational semantics and translate to fuzzy propositional logic systems ($PL_{[0,1]}$s). This paper establishes relationships of model equivalence between an $AFSA$ under a given semantics and the encoded formula in a related propositional logic system ($PLS$). By connections of $AFSA$s and $PLS$s, this paper provides the logical foundations for $AFSA$s associated with complete semantics and equational semantics. The results advance the argumentation theory by unifying $HOAF$s and $SETAF$s under logical formalisms, paving the way for automated reasoning tools in AI, decision support, and multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Effective Reductions with Ordinal Turing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:1811.11630, we introduced a notion of effective reducibility between set-theoretical $\Pi_{2}$-statements; in arXiv:2411.19386, this was extended to statements of arbitrary (potentially even infinite) quantifier complexity. We also considered a corresponding notion of Weihrauch reducibility, which allows only one call to the effectivizer of $\psi$ in a reduction of $\phi$ to $\psi$. In this paper, we refine this notion considerably by asking how many calls to an effectivizer for $\psi$ are required for effectivizing $\phi$. This allows us make formally precise questions such as ``how many ordinals does one need to check for being cardinals in order to compute the cardinality of a given ordinal?'' and (partially) answer many of them. Many of these anwers turn out to be independent of ZFC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general overview of the phenomenon of automatic continuity of homomorphisms between Polish groups is given. In particular, we study variants and improvements of the closed graph theorem, applying these to the problem of continuity of universally measurable homomorphisms and also to gauge the amount of choice needed to construct discontinuous homomorphisms between Polish groups. Furthermore, we provide a simple proof of automatic continuity in the context of homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds and a complete reworking of automatic continuity theory in the context of isometry groups of highly homogeneous complete metric structures.</description>

      <title>Flows with minimal subdynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countably infinite discrete group. A $\Gamma$-flow $X$ (i.e., a nonempty compact Hausdorff space equipped with a continuous action of $\Gamma$) is called $S$-minimal for a subset $S \subseteq \Gamma$ if the partial orbit $S \cdot x$ is dense for every point $x \in X$. We show that for any countable family $(S_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite subsets of $\Gamma$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $X$ that is $S_n$-minimal for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$; additionally, $X$ can be taken to be a subflow of $2^\Gamma$. This vastly generalizes a result of Frisch, Seward, and Zucker, in which each $S_n$ is required to be a normal subgroup of $\Gamma$. As a corollary, we show that for a given Polish $\Gamma$-flow $X$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $Y$ disjoint from $X$ in the sense of Furstenberg if and only if $X$ has no wandering points. This completes a line of inquiry started by Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. As another application, we strengthen some of the results of Gao, Jackson, Krohne, and Seward on the structure of Borel complete sections. For example, we show that if $B$ is a Borel complete section in the free part of $2^\Gamma$, then every union of sufficiently many shifts of $B$ contains an orbit (previously, this was only known for open sets $B$). Although our main results are purely dynamical, their proofs rely on recently developed machinery from descriptive set-theoretic combinatorics, namely the asymptotic separation index introduced by Conley, Jackson, Marks, Seward, and Tucker-Drob and its links to the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma.</description>
