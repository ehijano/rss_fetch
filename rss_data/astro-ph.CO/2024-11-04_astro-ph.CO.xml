      <title>Differing Manifestations of Spatial Curvature in Cosmological FRW Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find statistical evidence for a mismatch between the (global) spatial curvature parameter $K$ in the geodesic equation for incoming photons, and the corresponding parameter in the Friedmann equation that determines the time evolution of the background spacetime and its perturbations. The mismatch hereafter referred to as `curvature-slip' is especially evident when the SH0ES prior on the current expansion rate is assumed. This result is based on joint analyses of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations with the PLANCK satellite (P18), first year results of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Baryonic Oscillation (BAO) data, and - at a lower level of significance - also on Pantheon SNIa (SN) catalog. For example, the betting odds against the Null Hypothesis are greater than $10^7$:1, 1400:1 and 1000:1 when P18+SH0ES, P18+DES+SH0ES, and P18+BAO+SH0ES, respectively, are considered. Datasets involving SNIa weaken this curvature slip considerably. Notably, even when the SH0ES prior is not imposed the betting odds for the rejection of the Null Hypothesis are 70:1 and 160:1 in cases where P18+DES and P18+BAO are considered. When the SH0ES prior is imposed, global fit of the modified model (that allows for a nonvanishing `curvature slip') strongly outperforms that of $\Lambda$CDM as is manifested by significant Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) gains, ranging between 7 and 23, depending on the dataset combination considered. Even in comparison to K$\Lambda$CDM the proposed model results in significant, albeit smaller, DIC gains when SN data are excluded. Our finding could possibly be interpreted as an inherent inconsistency between the (idealized) maximally symmetric nature of the FRW metric, and the dynamical evolution of the GR-based homogeneous and isotropic $\Lambda$CDM model (abridged)</description>

      <title>Does it matter? A more careful treatment of density fluctuations in 21-cm simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological 21-cm signal is sourced from hyperfine transitions in neutral hydrogen atoms. Yet, although hydrogen atoms belong to the sub-class of baryonic matter, it is customary to simplify their treatment and analyze the 21-cm signal as if all the matter in the Universe was in the form of collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). This is usually done by evolving the density field via a scale-independent growth factor (SIGF). In this work, we separate the baryons from CDM and evolve the two species with a proper scale-dependent growth factor (SDGF). By incorporating the SDGF in the 21cmFirstCLASS code, we demonstrate the effect that baryons and CDM have on the 21-cm signal at the linear dark ages epoch and the subsequent non-linear epochs of cosmic dawn and reionization. Our analysis shows that the baryonic nature of hydrogen cannot be ignored during the dark ages, and that non-linear effects in density-field evolution must be accounted for after stars have formed. Furthermore, we discuss how the 21-cm signal is modified at lower redshifts, where ground-based 21-cm interferometers are mostly sensitive, due to the choice of working with either the "linear" or "non-linear" matter over-density (that is, the over-density as computed from linear perturbation theory, and non-linear perturbation theory, respectively) in the extended Press-Schechter formalism. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jordanflitter/21cmFirstCLASS.</description>

      <title>Spherical bias on the 3D reconstruction of the ICM density profile in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations of galaxy clusters are routinely used to derive radial distributions of ICM thermdynamical properties such as density and temperature. However, observations allow us to access quantities projected on the celestial sphere only, so that an assumption on the 3D distribution of the ICM is necessary. Usually, spherical geometry is assumed. The aim of this paper is to determine the bias due to this approximation on the reconstruction of ICM density radial profile of a clusters sample and on the intrinsic scatter of the density profiles distribution, when clusters substructures are not masked. We used 98 simulated clusters for which we know the 3D ICM distribution drawn from The Three Hundred project. For each cluster we simulated 40 different observations by projecting the cluster along 40 different lines of sight. We extracted the ICM density profile from each observation assuming the ICM to be spherical distributed. For each line of sight we then considered the mean density profile over the sample and compared it with the 3D density profile given by the simulations. The spherical bias on the density profile is derived by considering the ratio between the observed and the input quantities. We also study the bias on the intrinsic scatter of the density profile distribution performing the same procedure. We find a bias on the density profile, $b_n$, smaller than $10\%$ for $R\lesssim R_{500}$ while it increases up to $\sim 50\%$ for larger radii. The bias on the intrinsic scatter profile, $b_s$, reaches a value of $\approx 100\%$ for $R\approx R_{500}$. The bias on both the analysed quantities strongly depends on the morphology of the objects: for clusters that do not show large scale substructures, both $b_n$ and $b_s$ are reduced by a factor 2, conversely for systems that do show large scale substructures both $b_n$ and $b_s$ increase significantly.

      <title>Is there a dynamical tendency in H0 with late time measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the Hubble constant $H_0$ values derived from early-time and late-time measurements, reaching up to $4\sigma$, represents the most serious challenge in modern cosmology and astrophysics. In this work, we investigate if a similar tension exists between only late time measurements at different redshifts. We use the latest public datasets including Cosmic Chronometers, Megamasers, SNe Ia and DESI-BAO, that span from redshift $z \sim 0$ up to $z\sim 2.3$. By dividing the data into redshift bins, we derive $H_0$ values from each bin separately. Our analysis reveals a phenomenological dynamic evolution in $H_0$ across different redshift ranges, with a significance from $1.5\sigma$ and $2.3\sigma$, depending on the parameterization. Consistency of the model demands observational constancy of $H_0$ since it is an integration constant within the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Thus, these findings suggest that the observed Hubble tension might not only exist between early and late-time measurements but also among late-time data themselves, providing new insights into the nature of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Baryon Pasting the Uchuu Lightcone Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Baryon Pasted (BP) X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) maps derived from the half-sky Uchuu Lightcone simulation. These BP-Uchuu maps are constructed using more than $75$ million dark matter halos with masses $M_{500c} \geq 10^{13} M_\odot$ within the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 2$. A distinctive feature of our BP-Uchuu Lightcone maps is their capability to assess the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic scatter caused by triaxial gaseous halos and internal gas characteristics, respectively, at the map level. We show that triaxial gas drives substantial scatter in X-ray luminosities of clusters and groups, accounting for nearly half of the total scatter in core-excised measurements. Additionally, scatter in the thermal pressure and gas density profiles of halos enhances the X-ray and SZ power spectra, leading to biases in cosmological parameter estimates. These findings are statistically robust due to the extensive sky coverage and large halo sample in the BP-Uchuu maps.</description>

      <title>DESIVAST: A Catalog of Low-Redshift Voids using Data from the DESI DR1 Bright Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three separate void catalogs created using a volume-limited sample of the DESI Year 1 Bright Galaxy Survey. We use the algorithms VoidFinder and V2 to construct void catalogs out to a redshift of z=0.24. We obtain 1,461 interior voids with VoidFinder, 420 with V2 using REVOLVER pruning, and 295 with V2 using VIDE pruning. Comparing our catalog with an overlapping SDSS void catalog, we find generally consistent void properties but significant differences in the void volume overlap, which we attribute to differences in the galaxy selection and survey masks. These catalogs are suitable for studying the variation in galaxy properties with cosmic environment and for cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>The baryon census and the mass-density of stars, neutral gas, and hot gas as a function of halo mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stellar, neutral gas content within halos over a halo mass range $10^{10} \text{ to } 10^{15.5} \text{M}_\odot$ and hot X-ray gas content over a halo mass range $10^{12.8} \text{ to } 10^{15.5} \text{M}_\odot$ in the local universe. We combine various empirical datasets of stellar, \HI\ and X-ray observations of galaxies, groups and clusters to establish fundamental baryonic mass vs halo mass scaling relations. These scaling relations are combined with halo mass function to obtain the baryon densities of stars, neutral gas and hot gas ($T&gt;10^6 \text{K}$), as a function of halo mass. We calculate the contributions of the individual baryonic components to the cosmic baryon fraction. Cosmic stellar mass density ($\Omega_\text{star}=2.09^{+0.21}_{-0.18} \times 10^{-3}$), cosmic HI mass density ($\Omega_\text{HI}=0.49^{+0.25}_{-0.12} \times 10^{-3}$) and cosmic neutral gas mass density ($\Omega_\text{neutral gas}=0.71^{+0.39}_{-0.18} \times 10^{-3}$) estimates are consistent with previous more direct method measurements of these values, thereby establishing the veracity of our method. We also give an estimate of the cosmic hot plasma density ($\Omega_\text{hot gas}=2.58^{+2.1}_{-0.66} \times 10^{-3}$).</description>

      <title>Cross-Correlating the Universe: The Gravitational Wave Background and Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the gravitational wave background (GWB) is a key question in modern astrophysics and cosmology, with significant implications for understanding of the structure and evolution of the Universe. We demonstrate how cross-correlating large-scale structure (LSS) tracers with the GWB spatial anisotropies can extract a clear astrophysical imprint from the GWB signal. Focusing on the unresolved population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) as the primary source for the GWB at nanohertz frequencies, we construct full-sky maps of galaxy distributions and characteristic strain of the GWB to explore the relationship between GWB anisotropies and the LSS. We find that at current pulsar timing array (PTA) sensitivities, very few loud SMBHBs act as Poisson-like noise. This results in anisotropies dominated by a small number of sources, making GWB maps where SMBHBs trace the LSS indistinguishable from a GWBs from a uniform distribution of SMBHBs. In contrast, we find that the bulk of the unresolved SMBHBs produce anisotropies which mirror the spatial distribution of galaxies, and thus trace the LSS. Importantly, we show that cross-correlations are required to retrieve a clear LSS imprint in the GWB. Specifically, we find this LSS signature can me measured at a $3\sigma$ level in near-future PTA experiments that probe angular scales of $\ell_{\text{max}} \geq 42$, and $5\sigma$ for $\ell_{\text{max}} \geq 72$. Our approach opens new avenues to employ the GWB as an LSS tracer, providing unique insights into SMBHB population models and the nature of the GWB itself. Our results motivate further exploration of potential synergies between next-generation PTA experiments and cosmological tracers of the LSS.</description>

      <title>The shape of the Chameleon fifth-force on the mass components of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Chameleon gravity, we present a semi-analytical solution of the chameleon field profile in accurately modelled galaxy cluster's mass components, namely: the stellar mass of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG), the baryonic mass in galaxies (other than the BCG), the mass of the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) and the diffuse cold dark matter (CDM). The obtained semi-analytic profile is validated against the numerical solution of the chameleon field equation and implemented in the \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt} code for kinematic analyses of galaxy clusters in modified gravity scenarios. By means of mock halos, simulated both in GR and in modified gravity, we show that the combination of velocities and positions of cluster member galaxies, along with data of the stellar velocity dispersion profile of the BCG, can impose constraints on the parameter space of the Chameleon model; for a cluster generated in GR, these constraints are at the same level as a joint lensing+kinematics analysis of a cluster modelled with a single mass profile, without the BCG data.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Second-order Gravitational Waves in Axion-like Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a hybrid inflation model driven by an axion-like particle (ALP) $\phi$. The model predicts a spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.964$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.003$, in agreement with Planck data and potentially testable by next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. We find that the PBH mass and the peak of the associated scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) spectrum are correlated with the ALP mass. In particular, PBHs in the mass range $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ can constitute either the entire dark matter (DM) content of the universe or a significant fraction of it. The predicted second-order GWs from this mechanism are within the sensitivity reach of future observatories like LISA and ET. The typical reheating temperature in the model is around $10^6 - 10^7$ GeV is consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduced a phenomenological dark energy model $H^{2}+H^{-2}$ model) that incorporates the first-order approximation of Kaniadakis holographic entropy dark energy and utilizes the Hubble horizon, $1/H$ as the infrared cutoff. The advantage of this model is that it can relieve the Hubble tension issue and cicumventing the potential issue of a "big rip". In this article, we will study the thermodynamics of the model and obtain the corrected temperature. In addition, we found that the model modified the entropy area relationship by adding an area cubic term in addition to the area term.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the scalar field potential in non-metricity gravity through Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe has been widely confirmed, posing challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, particularly the cosmological coincidence problem. This has motivated the exploration of modified gravity theories, including non-metricity gravity, which explains cosmic acceleration without dark energy. In this work, we incorporate a quintessence scalar field into the non-metricity framework to model both inflation and late-time acceleration. Employing the Gaussian process method with a square exponential kernel, we reconstruct the scalar field potential, $V(\phi)$, from observational Hubble data sets coming from cosmic chronometers (CC) as well as from the method of radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in a model-independent approach. This approach allows us to obtain a suitable quintessence scalar field model that aligns with the observational Hubble data under the framework of power-law non-metricity gravity. Additionally, we compare our reconstructed potential with power-law scalar field potentials, revealing that these models show better agreement with the observational data, providing new insights into the dynamics of the universe. In contrast, we find that the early dark energy has minimal effect on the present-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>Heavy element abundances from a universal primordial distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a freeze-out approach to the formation of heavy elements in expanding nuclear matter. Applying concepts used in the description of heavy-ion collisions or ternary fission, we determine the abundances of heavy elements taking into account in-medium effects such as Pauli blocking and the Mott effect, which describes the dissolution of nuclei at high densities of nuclear matter. With this approach, we search for a universal primordial distribution in an equilibrium state from which the gross structure of the solar abundances of heavy elements freezes out via radioactive decay of the excited states. The universal primordial state is characterized by the Lagrangian parameters of temperature and chemical potentials of neutrons and protons. We show that such a state exists and determine a temperature of 5.266 MeV, a neutron chemical potential of 940.317 MeV and a proton chemical potential of 845.069 MeV, at a baryon number density of 0.013 fm$^{-3}$ and a proton fraction of 0.13. Heavy neutron-rich nuclei such as the hypothesized double-magic nucleus $^{358}$Sn appear in the primordial distribution and contribute to the observed abundances after fission. We discuss astrophysical scenarios for the realization of this universal primordial distribution for heavy element nucleosynthesis, including supernova explosions, neutron star mergers and the inhomogeneous Big Bang. The latter scenario may be of interest in the light of early massive objects observed with the James Webb Space Telescope and opens new perspectives to explain universality of the observed r-process patterns and the lack of observations of population III stars.</description>

      <title>Gauge coupling jump and small instantons from a large non-minimal coupling</title>

Abstract: If a scalar field couples to the Ricci scalar with a large non-minimal coupling, the Standard Model coupling parameters can differ above and below an intermediate field range of the scalar due to the non-renormalizability. In this paper, we study, for the first time, the threshold effects on a gauge coupling in both Metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. We find that the gauge coupling naturally jumps around this intermediate scale since counter terms for the renormalization behave so. If the gauge coupling becomes strong with a large scalar field value due to this effect, there can be an enhanced small instanton contribution, the dilute gas approximation of which is justified because the gauge sector decouples when the scalar wave mode is very short. Using these findings, we discuss the QCD axion quality problem, the heavy QCD axion, the QCD axion abundance, and the suppression of isocurvature perturbations. We show that axion physics may differ substantially from na\"{i}ve expectations when we introduce a large non-minimal coupling for any scalar field.</description>

      <title>Dark Sector Tunneling Field Potentials for a Dark Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All of the significant evidence for dark matter observed thus far has been through its gravitational interactions. After 40 years of direct detection experiments, the parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) as dark matter candidates is rapidly approaching the neutrino floor. In this light, we consider a dark sector that is strongly decoupled from the visible sector, interacting exclusively through gravity. In this model, proposed by Freese and Winkler (arXiv:2302.11579), dark matter can be produced through a first-order phase transition in the dark sector dubbed the Dark Big Bang. In this study we fully determine the allowed region of parameter space for the tunneling potential that leads to the realization of a Dark Big Bang and is consistent with all experimental bounds available.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within some theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters (GCs) can be determined by calculating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of GCs within Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, beyond Horndeski gravity (BHG), and modified emergent Newtonian gravity (MENG) with generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) correction. We apply the formulations on the masses of 10 GCs. We compare our results with the Newtonian mass of GCs. Within a regime, we get an insight that all formulations could match the Newtonian mass. Thus, the impact of the modified theories of gravity used in this work can be neglected in this regime. The noteworthy impact starts if we set $\kappa=5\times10^{40}$ for EiBI theory, $\Upsilon=-0.1655\times10^{69}$ for BHG, and $\beta_0=-1.656\times10^{110}$ for MENG. {We also compare our results from EiBI theory and BHG with the baryonic masses $M_{bar}$ of the GCs. A better linear fit is achieved by EiBI theory with $\kappa_0=5.80\times10^{40}$, which gives the slope $\mathcal{M}$ of $0.126\pm0.086$. This value is closer to unity than the one of BHG. This leads us to the fact that EiBI theory is more effective than BHG in alleviating the mass discrepancy between hydrostatic mass and baryonic mass in GCs. Nevertheless, neither EiBI theory nor BHG completely addresses the mass discrepancy problem.}</description>

      <title>Cutting rule for in-in correlators and cosmological collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a cutting rule for equal-time in-in correlators including cosmological correlators based on Keldysh $r/a$ basis, which decomposes diagrams into fully retarded functions and cut-propagators consisting of Wightman functions. Our derivation relies only on basic assumptions such as unitarity, locality, and the causal structure of the in-in formalism, and therefore holds for theories with arbitrary particle contents and local interactions at any loop order. As an application, we show that non-local cosmological collider signals arise solely from cut-propagators under the assumption of microcausality. Since the cut-propagators do not contain (anti-)time-ordering theta functions, the conformal time integrals are factorized, simplifying practical calculations.</description>

      <title>A census of dwarf galaxy satellites around LMC-mass galaxy NGC 2403</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive census of the satellite population around a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) stellar-mass galaxy, as part of the Magellanic Analog Dwarf Companions and Stellar Halos (MADCASH) survey. We have surveyed NGC 2403 (D=3.0 Mpc) with the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam imager out to a projected radius of 90 kpc (with partial coverage extending out to ~110 kpc, or ~80% of the virial radius of NGC 2403), resolving stars in the uppermost ~2.5 mags of its red giant branch. By looking for stellar overdensities in the red giant branch spatial density map, we identify 149 satellite candidates, of which only the previously discovered MADCASH J074238+65201-dw is a bona fide dwarf, together with the more massive and disrupting satellite DDO 44. We carefully assess the completeness of our search via injection of artificial dwarf galaxies into the images, finding that we are reliably sensitive to candidates down to M_V ~ -7.5 mag (and somewhat sensitive to even fainter satellites). A comparison of the satellite luminosity function of NGC 2403 down to this magnitude limit to theoretical expectations shows overall good agreement. This is the first of a full sample of 11 Magellanic Cloud-mass host galaxies we will analyze, creating a statistical sample that will provide the first quantitative constraints on hierarchical models of galaxy formation around low-mass hosts.</description>

      <title>Stellar stripping efficiencies of satellites in numerical simulations: the effect of resolution, satellite properties and numerical disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stellar stripping of satellites in cluster haloes is understood to play an important role in the production of intracluster light. Increasingly, cosmological simulations have been utilised to investigate its origin and assembly. However, such simulations typically model individual galaxies at relatively coarse resolutions, raising concerns about their accuracy. Although there is a growing literature on the importance of numerical resolution for the accurate recovery of the mass loss rates of dark matter (DM) haloes, there has been no comparable investigation into the numerical resolution required to accurately recover stellar mass loss rates in galaxy clusters.
  Using N-body simulations of satellite galaxies orbiting in a cluster halo represented by a static external potential, we conduct a set of convergence tests in order to explore the role of numerical resolution and force softening length on stellar stripping efficiency. We consider a number of orbital configurations, satellite masses and satellite morphologies. We find that stellar mass resolution is of minor importance relative to DM resolution. Resolving the central regions of satellite DM halos is critical to accurately recover stellar mass loss rates. Poorly resolved DM haloes develop cored inner profiles and, if this core is of comparable size to the stellar component of the satellite galaxy, this leads to significant over-stripping. To prevent this, relatively high DM mass resolutions of around $m_{\rm DM}\sim10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$, better than those achieved by many contemporary cosmological simulations, are necessary.</description>
