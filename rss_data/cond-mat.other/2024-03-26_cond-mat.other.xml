      <title>Multi-radius Soler-Williams Augmented Plane Waves (SAPMR) and multi-radius Soler-Williams Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (SLAPWMR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structures (Density Functional Theory (DFT)) calculations. It extends Soler Williams Linearized Augmented plane Wave (SLAPW) basis sets by allowing variable radii for the different angular momentum channels and wave vectors. This allows to match additional derivatives of the wave function at the Muffin Tin (MT) radius without having to resort to additional higher derivative terms. This should lead to low wave vector basis set and low linearization energy errors. We dub these basis sets SAPWMR and SLAPWMR. Similarly Local orbital (LO and lo) basis wave functions are suggested with a variable radius. Full Potential Hamiltonian calculations (FLAPW) are extended to FSLAPWMR full potential calculations in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: I. Calculation of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously obtained expressions describing the intensity of stationary fluorescence emitted by a multicomponent solution were significantly improved by using matrix calculus. Then, using a similar technique, new expressions describing the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the multicomponent system after pulsed excitation were found. In both of these cases, the effects of the internal filter, the effects of multistep radiative transfer of excitation energy, the possibility of radiative back-transfer, as well as the possibility of changes in the quantum yield of individual components due to radiationless transfer of excitation energy were taken into account. The cases of one-, two- and three-component systems were discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Integrated workflows and interfaces for data-driven semi-empirical electronic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern software engineering of electronic structure codes has seen a paradigm shift from monolithic workflows towards object-based modularity. Software objectivity allows for greater flexibility in the application of electronic structure calculations, with particular benefits when integrated with approaches for data-driven analysis. Here, we discuss different approaches to create "deep" modular interfaces that connect big-data workflows and electronic structure codes, and explore the diversity of use cases that they can enable. We present two such interface approaches for the semi-empirical electronic structure package, DFTB+. In one case, DFTB+ is applied as a library and provides data to an external workflow; and in another, DFTB+ receives data via external bindings and processes the information subsequently within an internal workflow. We provide a general framework to enable data exchange workflows for embedding new machine-learning-based Hamiltonians within DFTB+, or to enabling deep integration of DFTB+ in multiscale embedding workflows. These modular interfaces demonstrate opportunities in emergent software and workflows to accelerate scientific discovery by harnessing existing software capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-relativistic quantum field theory of electrons and nuclei based on the Coulomb Hamiltonian. We derive the exact equations of motion and write these equations in the form of Hedin's equations for all species of identical particles involved. Theory derived allows the computation of exact observables and provides a rigorous starting point to derive approximations in a systematic way.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Frequency Width, Nuclear Hyperfine Coupling and Jahn-Teller Effect of $Cu^{2+}$ Impurity Ion ESR in $SrLaAlO_4$ Dielectric Resonator at $20$ Millikelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impurity paramagnetic ion, $Cu^{2+}$ substitutes $Al$ in the $SrLaAlO_4$ single crystal lattice, this results in a $CuO_6$ elongated octahedron, the resulting measured g-factors shows four-fold axes variation condition. The aggregate frequency width of the electron spin resonance with the required minimum level of impurity concentration has been evaluated in single crystal $SrLaAlO_4$ at $20$ millikelvin. Measured parallel hyperfine constants, $A_{\scriptscriptstyle\parallel Cu}$, were determined to be $-155.7\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1},~ -163.0\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1},~ -178.3\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1} $ and$~-211.1\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1}$ at $9.072~GHz~(WGH_{4,1,1})$ for the nuclear magnetic quantum number $M_I=+\frac{3}{2},+\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$,~and$-\frac{3}{2}$ respectively. The anisotropy of the hyperfine structure reveals a characteristics of static Jahn-Teller effect. The second-order-anisotropy-term, $\sim (\frac{spin-orbit~coupling}{10D_q})^2$, is significant and can not be disregarded, with the local strain dominating over the observed Zeeman-anisotropy-energy difference. The Bohr electron magneton, $\beta=9.23\times 10^{-24} JT^{-1}$, (within $-0.43\%$ so-called experimental error) has been found using the measured spin-Hamiltonian parameters. Measured nuclear dipolar hyperfine structure parameter $P_{\scriptscriptstyle\parallel}=12.3\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1}$ shows that the mean inverse third power of the electron distance from the nucleus is $\langle r^{-3}_q\rangle\simeq 5.23$ a.u. for $Cu^{2+}$ ion in the substituted $Al^{3+}$ ion site assuming nuclear electric quadruple moment $Q=-0.211$ barn.</description>

      <title>Vector Ising Spin Annealer for Minimizing Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Vector Ising Spin Annealer (VISA), a framework in gain-based computing that harnesses light-matter interactions to solve complex optimization problems encoded in spin Hamiltonians. Traditional driven-dissipative systems often select excited states due to limitations in spin movement. VISA transcends these constraints by enabling spins to operate in a three-dimensional space, offering a robust solution to minimize Ising Hamiltonians effectively. Our comparative analysis reveals VISA's superior performance over conventional single-dimension spin optimizers, demonstrating its ability to bridge substantial energy barriers in complex landscapes. Through detailed studies on cyclic and random graphs, we show VISA's proficiency in dynamically evolving the energy landscape with time-dependent gain and penalty annealing, illustrating its potential to redefine optimization in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Embedded skyrmion bags in thin films of chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin configurations that possess particle-like properties. Earlier research was mainly focused on a specific type of skyrmion with topological charge Q = -1. However, theoretical analyses of two-dimensional chiral magnets have predicted the existence of skyrmion bags -- solitons with arbitrary positive or negative topological charge. Although such spin textures are metastable states, recent experimental observations have confirmed the stability of isolated skyrmion bags in a limited range of applied magnetic fields. Here, by utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, we show the extraordinary stability of skyrmion bags in thin plates of B20-type FeGe. In particular, we show that skyrmion bags embedded within a skyrmion lattice remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided. Our results agree perfectly with micromagnetic simulations and establish thin plates of cubic chiral magnets as a powerful platform for exploring a broad spectrum of topological magnetic solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-temperature properties of one and two layers of parahydrogen adsorbed on graphite are investigated theoretically through Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We adopt a microscopic model that explicitly includes the corrugation of the substrate. We study the phase diagram of a monolayer up to second layer promotion, and the possible occurrence of superfluidity in the second layer. We obtain results down to a temperature as low as 8 mK. We find second-layer promotion to occur at a considerably greater coverage than obtained in previous calculations and estimated experimentally; moreover, we find no evidence of a possible finite superfluid response in the second layer, disproving recent theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous measurements of nuclear spin heat capacity, temperature and relaxation in GaAs microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heat capacity of the nuclear spin system (NSS) in GaAs-based microstructures has been shown to be much greater than expected from dipolar coupling between nuclei, thus limiting the efficiency of NSS cooling by adiabatic demagnetization. It was suggested that quadrupole interaction induced by some small residual strain could provide this additional reservoir for the heat storage. We check and validate this hypothesis by combining nuclear spin relaxation measurements with adiabatic remagnetization and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, using electron spin noise spectroscopy as a unique tool for detection of nuclear magnetization. Our results confirm and quantify the role of the quadrupole splitting in the heat storage within NSS and provide additional insight into fundamental, but still actively debated relation between a mechanical strain and the resulting electric field gradients in GaAs.</description>

      <title>On the temperature dependence of the density of states of liquids at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report neutron-scattering measurements of the density of states (DOS) of water and liquid Fomblin in a wide range of temperatures. In the liquid phase, we confirm the presence of a universal low-energy linear scaling of the experimental DOS as a function of the frequency, $g(\omega)= a(T) \omega$, which persists at all temperatures. The low-frequency scaling of the DOS exhibits a sharp jump at the melting point of water, below which the standard Debye's law, $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is recovered. On the contrary, in Fomblin, we observe a continuous transition between the two exponents reflecting its glassy dynamics, which is confirmed by structure measurements. More importantly, in both systems, we find that the slope $a(T)$ grows with temperature following an exponential Arrhenius-like form, $a(T) \propto \exp(-\langle E \rangle /T)$. We confirm this experimental trend using molecular dynamics simulations and show that the prediction of instantaneous normal mode (INM) theory for $a(T)$ is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data.</description>
