      <title>Exploring Image Transforms derived from Eye Gaze Variables for Progressive Autism Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has surged rapidly over the past decade, posing significant challenges in communication, behavior, and focus for affected individuals. Current diagnostic techniques, though effective, are time-intensive, leading to high social and economic costs. This work introduces an AI-powered assistive technology designed to streamline ASD diagnosis and management, enhancing convenience for individuals with ASD and efficiency for caregivers and therapists. The system integrates transfer learning with image transforms derived from eye gaze variables to diagnose ASD. This facilitates and opens opportunities for in-home periodical diagnosis, reducing stress for individuals and caregivers, while also preserving user privacy through the use of image transforms. The accessibility of the proposed method also offers opportunities for improved communication between guardians and therapists, ensuring regular updates on progress and evolving support needs. Overall, the approach proposed in this work ensures timely, accessible diagnosis while protecting the subjects' privacy, improving outcomes for individuals with ASD.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models in Medical Imaging -- A Review and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Augmented Implicit Neural Representation for Unsupervised High-Dimensional Quantitative MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps. Furthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad potential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction tasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Deep Learning Framework for Brain Stroke and Tumor Progression via MRI Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate detection of brain abnormalities, such as tumors and strokes, is essential for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we present a deep learning-based system capable of identifying both brain tumors and strokes from MRI images, along with their respective stages. We have executed two groundbreaking strategies involving convolutional neural networks, MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50-optimized through transfer learning to classify MRI scans into five diagnostic categories. Our dataset, aggregated and augmented from various publicly available MRI sources, was carefully curated to ensure class balance and image diversity. To enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting, we applied dropout layers and extensive data augmentation. The models achieved strong performance, with training accuracy reaching 93\% and validation accuracy up to 88\%. While ResNet-50 demonstrated slightly better results, Mobile Net V2 remains a promising option for real-time diagnosis in low resource settings due to its lightweight architecture. This research offers a practical AI-driven solution for early brain abnormality detection, with potential for clinical deployment and future enhancement through larger datasets and multi modal inputs.</description>

      <title>The RSNA Lumbar Degenerative Imaging Spine Classification (LumbarDISC) Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Lumbar Degenerative Imaging Spine Classification (LumbarDISC) dataset is the largest publicly available dataset of adult MRI lumbar spine examinations annotated for degenerative changes. The dataset includes 2,697 patients with a total of 8,593 image series from 8 institutions across 6 countries and 5 continents. The dataset is available for free for non-commercial use via Kaggle and RSNA Medical Imaging Resource of AI (MIRA). The dataset was created for the RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification competition where competitors developed deep learning models to grade degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. The degree of spinal canal, subarticular recess, and neural foraminal stenosis was graded at each intervertebral disc level in the lumbar spine. The images were annotated by expert volunteer neuroradiologists and musculoskeletal radiologists from the RSNA, American Society of Neuroradiology, and the American Society of Spine Radiology. This dataset aims to facilitate research and development in machine learning and lumbar spine imaging to lead to improved patient care and clinical efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Two-Stage Feature Decomposition Method for Deep Learning-based SAR ATR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR ATR) has seen significant performance improvements with deep learning. However, the black-box nature of deep SAR ATR introduces low confidence and high risks in decision-critical SAR applications, hindering practical deployment. To address this issue, deep SAR ATR should provide an interpretable reasoning basis $r_b$ and logic $\lambda_w$, forming the reasoning logic $\sum_{i} {{r_b^i} \times {\lambda_w^i}} =pred$ behind the decisions. Therefore, this paper proposes a physics-based two-stage feature decomposition method for interpretable deep SAR ATR, which transforms uninterpretable deep features into attribute scattering center components (ASCC) with clear physical meanings. First, ASCCs are obtained through a clustering algorithm. To extract independent physical components from deep features, we propose a two-stage decomposition method. In the first stage, a feature decoupling and discrimination module separates deep features into approximate ASCCs with global discriminability. In the second stage, a multilayer orthogonal non-negative matrix tri-factorization (MLO-NMTF) further decomposes the ASCCs into independent components with distinct physical meanings. The MLO-NMTF elegantly aligns with the clustering algorithms to obtain ASCCs. Finally, this method ensures both an interpretable reasoning process and accurate recognition results. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets confirm its effectiveness, showcasing the method's interpretability, robust recognition performance, and strong generalization capability.</description>

      <title>A Cytology Dataset for Early Detection of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a major global health burden, particularly in several regions across Asia, Africa, and South America, where it accounts for a significant proportion of cancer cases. Early detection dramatically improves outcomes, with stage I cancers achieving up to 90 percent survival. However, traditional diagnosis based on histopathology has limited accessibility in low-resource settings because it is invasive, resource-intensive, and reliant on expert pathologists. On the other hand, oral cytology of brush biopsy offers a minimally invasive and lower cost alternative, provided that the remaining challenges, inter observer variability and unavailability of expert pathologists can be addressed using artificial intelligence. Development and validation of robust AI solutions requires access to large, labeled, and multi-source datasets to train high capacity models that generalize across domain shifts. We introduce the first large and multicenter oral cytology dataset, comprising annotated slides stained with Papanicolaou(PAP) and May-Grunwald-Giemsa(MGG) protocols, collected from ten tertiary medical centers in India. The dataset is labeled and annotated by expert pathologists for cellular anomaly classification and detection, is designed to advance AI driven diagnostic methods. By filling the gap in publicly available oral cytology datasets, this resource aims to enhance automated detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve early OSCC diagnosis in resource-constrained settings, ultimately contributing to reduced mortality and better patient outcomes worldwide.</description>

      <title>Sampling Theory for Super-Resolution with Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end, we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image from its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a sufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem. To validate our theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the performance of INRs on super-resolution recovery of continuous domain phantom images.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Heterogeneous Biomolecules via Hierarchical Gaussian Mixtures and Part Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for 4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle, providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM heterogeneity methods.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gaussian Entropy Model for Point Cloud Attribute Compression with Dynamic Likelihood Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian and Laplacian entropy models are proved effective in learned point cloud attribute compression, as they assist in arithmetic coding of latents. However, we demonstrate through experiments that there is still unutilized information in entropy parameters estimated by neural networks in current methods, which can be used for more accurate probability estimation. Thus we introduce generalized Gaussian entropy model, which controls the tail shape through shape parameter to more accurately estimate the probability of latents. Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, existing methods use fixed likelihood intervals for each integer during arithmetic coding, which limits model performance. We propose Mean Error Discriminator (MED) to determine whether the entropy parameter estimation is accurate and then dynamically adjust likelihood intervals. Experiments show that our method significantly improves rate-distortion (RD) performance on three VAE-based models for point cloud attribute compression, and our method can be applied to other compression tasks, such as image and video compression.</description>

      <title>HopaDIFF: Holistic-Partial Aware Fourier Conditioned Diffusion for Referring Human Action Segmentation in Multi-Person Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding, aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse evaluation settings. The code is available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/HopaDIFF.git.</description>

      <title>Coil2Coil: Self-supervised MR image denoising using phased-array coil images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising of magnetic resonance images is beneficial in improving the quality of low signal-to-noise ratio images. Recently, denoising using deep neural networks has demonstrated promising results. Most of these networks, however, utilize supervised learning, which requires large training images of noise-corrupted and clean image pairs. Obtaining training images, particularly clean images, is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, methods such as Noise2Noise (N2N) that require only pairs of noise-corrupted images have been developed to reduce the burden of obtaining training datasets. In this study, we propose a new self-supervised denoising method, Coil2Coil (C2C), that does not require the acquisition of clean images or paired noise-corrupted images for training. Instead, the method utilizes multichannel data from phased-array coils to generate training images. First, it divides and combines multichannel coil images into two images, one for input and the other for label. Then, they are processed to impose noise independence and sensitivity normalization such that they can be used for the training images of N2N. For inference, the method inputs a coil-combined image (e.g., DICOM image), enabling a wide application of the method. When evaluated using synthetic noise-added images, C2C shows the best performance against several self-supervised methods, reporting comparable outcomes to supervised methods. When testing the DICOM images, C2C successfully denoised real noise without showing structure-dependent residuals in the error maps. Because of the significant advantage of not requiring additional scans for clean or paired images, the method can be easily utilized for various clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play image restoration with Stochastic deNOising REgularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms are a class of iterative algorithms that address image inverse problems by combining a physical model and a deep neural network for regularization. Even if they produce impressive image restoration results, these algorithms rely on a non-standard use of a denoiser on images that are less and less noisy along the iterations, which contrasts with recent algorithms based on Diffusion Models (DM), where the denoiser is applied only on re-noised images. We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided. Experimentally, we prove that SNORE is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring and inpainting tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Towards a Sampling Theory for Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end, we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image from its low-pass Fourier coefficients by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a sufficient number of samples for which an image realized by a width-1 INR is exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem, and give a conjecture for the general width-$W$ case. To validate our theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the performance of INR on super-resolution recovery of more realistic continuous domain phantom images.</description>

      <title>UKAN-EP: Enhancing U-KAN with Efficient Attention and Pyramid Aggregation for 3D Multi-Modal MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gliomas are among the most common malignant brain tumors and are characterized by considerable heterogeneity, which complicates accurate detection and segmentation. Multi-modal MRI is the clinical standard for glioma imaging, but variability across modalities and high computational complexity hinder effective automated segmentation. In this paper, we propose UKAN-EP, a novel 3D extension of the original 2D U-KAN model for multi-modal MRI brain tumor segmentation. While U-KAN integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into a U-Net backbone, UKAN-EP further incorporates Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Pyramid Feature Aggregation (PFA) modules to enhance inter-modality feature fusion and multi-scale feature representation. We also introduce a dynamic loss weighting strategy that adaptively balances the Cross-Entropy and Dice losses during training. We evaluate UKAN-EP on the 2024 BraTS-GLI dataset and compare it against strong baselines including U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Swin UNETR. Results show that UKAN-EP achieves superior segmentation performance while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. An extensive ablation study further demonstrates the effectiveness of ECA and PFA, as well as the limited utility of self-attention and spatial attention alternatives.

      <title>NeRF-CA: Dynamic Reconstruction of X-ray Coronary Angiography with Extremely Sparse-views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic three-dimensional (4D) reconstruction from two-dimensional X-ray coronary angiography (CA) remains a significant clinical problem. Existing CA reconstruction methods often require extensive user interaction or large training datasets. Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has successfully reconstructed high-fidelity scenes in natural and medical contexts without these requirements. However, challenges such as sparse-views, intra-scan motion, and complex vessel morphology hinder its direct application to CA data. We introduce NeRF-CA, a first step toward a fully automatic 4D CA reconstruction that achieves reconstructions from sparse coronary angiograms. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the challenges of sparse-views and cardiac motion by decoupling the scene into the moving coronary artery and the static background, effectively translating the problem of motion into a strength. NeRF-CA serves as a first stepping stone for solving the 4D CA reconstruction problem, achieving adequate 4D reconstructions from as few as four angiograms, as required by clinical practice, while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art sparse-view X-ray NeRF. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively using representative 4D phantom datasets and ablation studies. To accelerate research in this domain, we made our codebase public: https://github.com/kirstenmaas/NeRF-CA.</description>

      <title>The Efficacy of Semantics-Preserving Transformations in Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a central component of joint embedding self-supervised learning (SSL). Approaches that work for natural images may not always be effective in medical imaging tasks. This study systematically investigated the impact of data augmentation and preprocessing strategies in SSL for lung ultrasound. Three data augmentation pipelines were assessed: (1) a baseline pipeline commonly used across imaging domains, (2) a novel semantic-preserving pipeline designed for ultrasound, and (3) a distilled set of the most effective transformations from both pipelines. Pretrained models were evaluated on multiple classification tasks: B-line detection, pleural effusion detection, and COVID-19 classification. Experiments revealed that semantics-preserving data augmentation resulted in the greatest performance for COVID-19 classification - a diagnostic task requiring global image context. Cropping-based methods yielded the greatest performance on the B-line and pleural effusion object classification tasks, which require strong local pattern recognition. Lastly, semantics-preserving ultrasound image preprocessing resulted in increased downstream performance for multiple tasks. Guidance regarding data augmentation and preprocessing strategies was synthesized for practitioners working with SSL in ultrasound.</description>

      <title>DeepMultiConnectome: Deep Multi-Task Prediction of Structural Connectomes Directly from Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies. We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Optical Tracking and Imaging of Randomly Moving Targets through Strongly Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracking and acquiring simultaneous optical images of randomly moving targets obscured by scattering media remains a challenging problem of importance to many applications that require precise object localization and identification. In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Modulated Implicit Neural Representation for Multispectral Satellite Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multispectral satellite images play a vital role in agriculture, fisheries, and environmental monitoring. However, their high dimensionality, large data volumes, and diverse spatial resolutions across multiple channels pose significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite data. ImpliSat leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while preserving critical image details.</description>
