      <title>Discerning media bias within a network of political allies: an analytic condition for disruption by partisans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An individual's opinion concerning political bias in the media is shaped by exogenous factors (independent analysis of media outputs) and endogenous factors (social activity, e.g. peer pressure by political allies and opponents in a network). Previous numerical studies show, that persuadable agents in allies-only networks are disrupted from asymptotically learning the intrinsic bias of a media organization, when the network is populated by one or more obdurate agents (partisans), who are not persuadable themselves but exert peer pressure on other agents. Some persuadable agents asymptotically learn a false bias, while others vacillate indefinitely between a false bias and the true bias, a phenomenon called turbulent nonconvergence which also emerges in opponents-only and mixed networks without partisans. Here we derive an analytic instability condition, which demarcates turbulent nonconvergence from asymptotic learning as a function of key network properties, for an idealized model of media bias featuring a biased coin. The condition is verified with Monte Carlo simulations as a function of network size, sparsity, and partisan fraction. It is derived in a probabilistic framework, where an agent's opinion is uncertain and is described by a probability density function, which is multimodal in general, generalizing previous studies which assume that an agent's opinion is certain (i.e. described by one number). The results and their social implications are interpreted briefly in terms of the social science theory of structural balance.</description>

      <title>When cardinals strategize: An agent-based model of influence and ideology for the papal conclave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze two agent-based models to investigate the dynamics of papal conclaves, focusing on how social influence, strategic voting, and ideological alignment affect the time required to elect a pope. In the first model, cardinals interact through two mechanisms: with probability $p$, they imitate the choice of a randomly selected peer, and with probability $q$, they shift support to the most voted candidate from the previous round. Additionally, strategic behavior is introduced via ``useful voting'', where agents abandon their preferred candidate if he receives less than a certain fraction of the votes, switching instead to the most viable alternative. A candidate must secure a qualified majority of two-thirds to be elected. After that, we extend the framework by incorporating ideological blocs, assigning each cardinal and candidate to one of two groups (e.g., progressives and conservatives). Cardinals initially vote for candidates from their own group, but may cross ideological lines due to strategic considerations. We initialize the population with $20\%$ conservative cardinals, reflecting the current composition shaped by papal appointments. Numerical simulations show that ideological polarization can delay the election, increasing the average number of voting rounds. Our results highlight the crucial role of both strategic flexibility and ideological structure in collective decision-making under conditions found in papal conclaves. The recent rapid outcome of the 2025 conclave, despite a polarized electorate, suggests that informal consensus-building - possibly prior to voting - may play a decisive role in accelerating convergence, complementing the mechanisms explored in our model.</description>

      <title>Interdependence between individual and social learning shapes cooperation with asymmetric exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation on social networks is crucial for understanding human survival and development. Although network structure has been found to significantly influence cooperation, some human experiments indicate that it cannot fully explain the evolutionary patterns of cooperation. While evidence suggests that this gap arises from human exploration, our understanding of its impact mechanisms and characteristics, such as asymmetry, remains limited. Here, we seek to formalize human exploration as an individual learning process involving trial and reflection, and integrate social learning to examine how their interdependence shapes cooperation. We find that individual learning can alter the imitative tendency of social learning, while its cooperative tendency in turn relies on social learning and players' decision preferences. By analyzing a series of key experiments, we show that the above coupled dynamics can explain human behavior in game interactions. Furthermore, we find that individual learning can promote cooperation when its probability is negatively correlated with payoffs, a mechanism rooted in the psychological tendency to avoid trial-and-error when individuals are satisfied with their current payoffs. These results link long-unexplained asymmetric exploration with the cooperation-promoting ability of social networks, helping to bridge the gap between theoretical research and reality.</description>

      <title>More Than Opinions: The Role of Values in Shaping Fairness and Status in the Ultimatum Game within Structured Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric evolutionary games, such as the Ultimatum Game, provide keys to understanding the emergence of fairness in social species. Building on this framework, we explore the evolution of social value systems and the operational role that social status plays in hierarchically organised societies. Within the asymmetric Ultimatum Game paradigm, where "proposers" suggest terms for resource distribution, and "responders" accept or reject these terms, we examine the assignment of roles between players under a subjective social order. This order is grounded in an emergent status hierarchy based on observable player attributes (such as age and wealth). The underlying rules for constructing such a hierarchy stabilise over time by inheritance and family ties. Despite their subjective nature these (often sub-conscious) value systems have operative meaning in controlling access of individuals to resources and decision making. We demonstrate these effects using a simple but sufficiently complex model with dynamical population size and network structure, where division of resources (prey) is carried out according to the principles of the Ultimatum Game. We focus on the emerging proposer and responder thresholds under distinct social hierarchies and interaction networks and discuss them in relation to the extensive body of Ultimatum Game experiments conducted across a wide range of cultural contexts. We observe the emergence of diverse sharing norms, ranging from unfair to highly generous, alongside the development of various social norms.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation and competition in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation and competition coexist and coevolve in natural and social systems. Cooperation generates resources, which in turn, drive non-cooperative competition to secure individual shares. How this complex interplay between cooperation and competition shapes the evolution of social dilemmas and welfare remains unknown. In this study, we introduce a two-layer evolutionary game model, in which one layer is a cooperative public goods game, and the other is a competitive involution game, with cross-layer feedback linking the two. We find that feedback can either promote or inhibit cooperation, depending on the baseline conditions. For example, moderate resource and synergy factor values can promote social welfare when feedback strength is large. This provides an approach to adjusting the strength and asymmetry of cross-layer feedback to promote cooperation and social welfare. We thus emphasize the importance of managing feedback mechanisms to balance cooperation and competition in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Data-Driven Modeling of Human Drivers' Lane-Changing Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lane-changing (LC) behavior, a critical yet complex driving maneuver, significantly influences driving safety and traffic dynamics. Traditional analytical LC decision (LCD) models, while effective in specific environments, often oversimplify behavioral heterogeneity and complex interactions, limiting their capacity to capture real LCD. Data-driven approaches address these gaps by leveraging rich empirical data and machine learning to decode latent decision-making patterns, enabling adaptive LCD modeling in dynamic environments. In light of the rapid development of artificial intelligence and the demand for data-driven models oriented towards connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of data-driven LCD models, with a particular focus on human drivers LC decision-making. It systematically reviews the modeling framework, covering data sources and preprocessing, model inputs and outputs, objectives, structures, and validation methods. This survey further discusses the opportunities and challenges faced by data-driven LCD models, including driving safety, uncertainty, as well as the integration and improvement of technical frameworks.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness and Reducibility of Multiplex Networks with Embedding-Aided Interlayer Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of interlayer similarity of multiplex networks helps to understand the intrinsic structure of complex systems, revealing how changes in one layer can propagate and affect others, thus enabling broad implications for transportation, social, and biological systems. Existing algorithms that measure similarity between network layers typically encode only partial information, which limits their effectiveness in capturing the full complexity inherent in multiplex networks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel interlayer similarity measuring approach named Embedding Aided inTerlayer Similarity (EATSim). EATSim concurrently incorporates intralayer structural similarity and cross-layer anchor node alignment consistency, providing a more comprehensive framework for analyzing interconnected systems. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that EATSim effectively captures the underlying geometric similarities between interconnected networks, significantly improving the accuracy of interlayer similarity measurement. Moreover, EATSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in two downstream applications: predicting network robustness and network reducibility, showing its great potential in enhancing the understanding and management of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least connected nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. As an application of the method, we present a scheme to detect multiple core-periphery structures and the decomposition of coarse-grained supernode networks, by combining the method with the network community detection.</description>

      <title>Applicability of spatial early warning signals to complex network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early warning signals (EWSs) for complex dynamical systems aim to anticipate tipping points before they occur. While signals computed from time series data, such as temporal variance, are useful for this task, they are costly to obtain in practice because they need many samples over time to calculate. Spatial EWSs use just a single sample per spatial location and aggregate the samples over space rather than time to try to mitigate this limitation. However, although many complex systems in nature and society form diverse networks, the performance of spatial EWSs is mostly unknown for general networks because the vast majority of studies of spatial EWSs have been on regular lattice networks. Therefore, we have carried out a comprehensive investigation of six major spatial EWSs on various networks. We find that the winning EWS depends on tipping scenarios, although the coefficient of variation and spatial skewness tend to outperform alternative EWSs. We also find that spatial EWSs behave in a drastically different manner between the square lattice and complex networks and tend to be more reliable for the latter than the former. The present results encourage further studies of spatial EWSs on complex networks.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from establishing a rooftop photovoltaic system crowdsourced by students and employees at Aarhus University</title>

Abstract: Energy communities are promoted in the European legislation as a strategy to enable citizen participation in the energy transition. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, due to their distributed nature, present an opportunity to create such communities. At Aarhus University (Denmark), we have established an energy community consisting of a 98-kW rooftop solar PV installation, crowdsourced by students and employees of the university. The participants can buy one or several shares of the installation (which is divided into 900 shares), the electricity is consumed by the university, and the shareowners receive some economic compensation every year. The road to establishing this energy community has been rough, and we have gathered many lessons. In this manuscript, we present the 10 largest challenges which might arise when setting up a university energy community and our particular approach to facing them. Sharing these learnings might pave the way for those willing to establish their own energy community. We also include policy recommendations at the European, national, and municipal levels to facilitate the deployment of energy communities</description>

      <title>Adaptation of quantum models to economic growth theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional economic growth theories, grounded in deterministic and often linear frameworks, fail to adequately capture the inherent uncertainty, non-commutativity, and complex interdependencies of modern economies. This paper proposes a novel approach by transposing fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics-such as superposition, operator algebra, and path integrals-into the realm of macroeconomic modeling. Within this quantum framework, core economic variables (capital, labor, and technological progress) are redefined as non-commuting operators acting on Hilbert spaces, and the state of the economy is represented as a dynamic wave function governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The evolution of this economic wave function follows a generalized Schr{\"o}dinger equation, developed here through Dyson series and Magnus expansions. We also define a quantum production function as the expected value of a composite operator, capturing the probabilistic nature of economic output. By integrating uncertainty relations analogous to Heisenberg's principle, and modeling economic fluctuations via Langevin dynamics, we extend the model to include dissipation, feedback loops, and non-linear interactions between variables. Finally, a Feynman path integral formalism is constructed to provide an alternative trajectory-based interpretation of economic dynamics. This quantum-inspired framework offers a rigorous and flexible methodology to rethink macroeconomic modeling under radical uncertainty, with potential applications in dynamic policy simulations and innovation-driven growth.</description>

      <title>Variational Resolution of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac Equation Pathologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a structural variational resolution of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) pathologies. By deriving the Variational Kinematic Constraint (VKC) and the Variational Dynamics Constraint (VDC) from the particle's proper-time perspective, we show that self-induced variations are forbidden and dynamics arise solely from first-order proper-time variations of external fields. Consequently, self-force terms are excluded at the variational level, eliminating runaway solutions and non-causal behavior without regularization. Our framework further provides a first-principles derivation of minimal coupling and reveals gauge invariance as a necessary consequence of proper-time-based variational structure.</description>
