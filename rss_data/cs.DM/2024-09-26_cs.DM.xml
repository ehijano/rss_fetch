      <title>The 2-domination number of cylindrical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A vertex subset S of a graph G is said to 2-dominate the graph if each vertex not in S has at least two neighbors in it. As usual, the associated parameter is the minimum cardinal of a 2-dominating set, which is called the 2-domination number of the graph G. We present both lower and upper bounds of the 2-domination number of cylinders, which are the Cartesian products of a path and a cycle. These bounds allow us to compute the exact value of the 2-domination number of cylinders where the path is arbitrary, and the order of the cycle is n $\equiv$ 0(mod 3) and as large as desired. In the case of the lower bound, we adapt the technique of the wasted domination to this parameter and we use the so-called tropical matrix product to obtain the desired bound. Moreover, we provide a regular patterned construction of a minimum 2-dominating set in the cylinders having the mentioned cycle order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By "geodesic" we mean any sequence of vertices $(v_1,v_2,...,v_k)$ of a graph $G$ that constitute a shortest path from $v_1$ to $v_k$. We propose a novel, output-polynomial algorithm to enumerate all geodesics of $G$. The graph can be directed or not, and weighted or not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integer solutions of Diophantine equations related to Lehmer's totient conjecture. We give an algorithm that computes all nontrivial positive spoof Lehmer factorizations with a fixed number of bases $r$, and enumerate all nontrivial positive spoof Lehmer factorizations with 6 or fewer factors.</description>

      <title>Accumulator-Aware Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent studies have investigated low-precision accumulation, reporting improvements in throughput, power, and area across various platforms. However, the accompanying proposals have only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models continue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To the best of our knowledge, ours marks the first formal study of accumulator-aware quantization in the PTQ setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, a practical framework of accumulator-aware extensions designed to endow overflow avoidance guarantees to existing layer-wise PTQ algorithms. We theoretically motivate AXE and demonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two state-of-the-art PTQ algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We further generalize AXE to support multi-stage accumulation for the first time, opening the door for full datapath optimization and scaling to large language models (LLMs). We evaluate AXE across image classification and language generation models, and observe significant improvements in the trade-off between accumulator bit width and model accuracy over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Pentagon Minimization without Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Guy initiated a line of research studying $\mu_k(n)$, the minimum number of convex $k$-gons one can obtain by placing $n$ points in the plane without any three of them being collinear. Asymptotically, the limits $c_k := \lim_{n\to \infty} \mu_k(n)/\binom{n}{k}$ exist for all $k$, and are strictly positive due to the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem. This article focuses on the case $k=5$, where $c_5$ was known to be between $0.0608516$ and $0.0625$ (Goaoc et al., 2018; Subercaseaux et al., 2023). The lower bound was obtained through the Flag Algebra method of Razborov using semi-definite programming. In this article we prove a more modest lower bound of $\frac{5\sqrt{5}-11}{4} \approx 0.04508$ without any computation; we exploit``planar-point equations'' that count, in different ways, the number of convex pentagons (or other geometric objects) in a point placement. To derive our lower bound we combine such equations by viewing them from a statistical perspective, which we believe can be fruitful for other related problems.</description>

      <title>Ammann Bars for Octagonal Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13973v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ammann bars are formed by segments (decorations) on the tiles of a tiling such that forming straight lines with them while tiling forces non-periodicity. Only a few cases are known, starting with Robert Ammann's observations on Penrose tiles, but there is no general explanation or construction. In this article we propose a general method for cut and project tilings based on the notion of subperiods and we illustrate it with an aperiodic set of 36 decorated prototiles related to what we called Cyrenaic tilings.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the genus for 2-cell embeddings of prefix-reversal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide bounds for the genus of the pancake graph $\mathbb{P}_n$, burnt pancake graph $\mathbb{BP}_n$, and undirected generalized pancake graph $\mathbb{P}_m(n)$. Our upper bound for $\mathbb{P}_n$ is sharper than the previously-known bound, and the other bounds presented are the first of their kind. Our proofs are constructive and rely on finding an appropriate rotation system (also referred to in the literature as Edmonds' permutation technique) where certain cycles in the graphs we consider become boundaries of regions of a 2-cell embedding. A key ingredient in the proof of our bounds for the genus $\mathbb{P}_n$ and $\mathbb{BP}_n$ is a labeling algorithm of their vertices that allows us to implement rotation systems to bound the number of regions of a 2-cell embedding of said graphs. All of our bounds are asymptotically tight; in particular, the genus of $\mathbb{P}_m(n)$ is $\Theta(m^nnn!)$ for all $m\geq1$ and $n\geq2$.</description>

      <title>SSD Set System, Graph Decomposition and Hamiltonian Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study what we call Superset-Subset-Disjoint (SSD) set system. Based on properties of SSD set system, we derive the following (I) to (IV):
  (I) For a nonnegative integer $k$ and a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|\ge2$, let $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_q\subsetneq V$ denote all maximal proper subsets of $V$ that induce $k$-edge-connected subgraphs. Then at least one of (a) and (b) holds: (a) $\{X_1,X_2,\dots,X_q\}$ is a partition of $V$; and (b) $V\setminus X_1, V\setminus X_2,\dots,V\setminus X_q$ are pairwise disjoint.
  (II) For $k=1$ and a strongly-connected digraph $G$, whether $V$ is in (a) and/or (b) can be decided in $O(n+m)$ time and we can generate all such $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_q$ in $O(n+m+|X_1|+|X_2|+\dots+|X_q|)$ time, where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$.
  (III) For a digraph $G$, we can enumerate in linear delay all vertex subsets of $V$ that induce strongly-connected subgraphs.
  (IV) A digraph is Hamiltonian if there is a spanning subgraph that is strongly-connected and in the case (a).</description>

      <title>About almost covering subsets of the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and consider the hypercube $\{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$. Sziklai and Weiner (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 2022) showed that if a polynomial $P ( X_{1}, \dots, X_{n} ) \in \mathbb{F}[ X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}]$ vanishes on every point of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ except those with at most $r$ many ones then the degree of the polynomial will be at least $n-r$. This is a generalization of Alon and F\"uredi's fundamental result (European Journal of Combinatorics 1993) about polynomials vanishing on every point of the hypercube except at the origin (point with all zero coordinates). Sziklai and Weiner proved their interesting result using M\"{o}bius inversion formula and the Zeilberger method for proving binomial equalities. In this short note, we show that a stronger version of Sziklai and Weiner's result can be derived directly from Alon and F\"{u}redi's result.</description>

      <title>Extending Stable and Popular Matching Algorithms from Bipartite to Arbitrary Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stable and popular matching problems in arbitrary graphs, which are referred to as stable roommates instances. We extend the 3/2-approximation algorithm for the maximum size weakly stable matching problem to the roommates case, which solves a more than 20 year old open question of Irving and Manlove about the approximability of maximum size weakly stable matchings in roommates instances with ties [Irving and Manlove 2002] and has nice applications for the problem of matching residents to hospitals in the presence of couples. We also extend the algorithm that finds a maximum size popular matching in bipartite graphs in the case of strict preferences and the algorithm to find a popular matching among maximum weight matchings. While previous attempts to extend the idea of promoting the agents or duplicating the edges from bipartite instances to arbitrary ones failed, these results show that with the help of a simple observation, we can indeed bridge the gap and extend these algorithms</description>
