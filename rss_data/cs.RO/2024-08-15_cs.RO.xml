      <title>The Design of Autonomous UAV Prototypes for Inspecting Tunnel Construction Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents novel designs of autonomous UAV prototypes specifically developed for inspecting GPS-denied tunnel construction environments with dynamic human and robotic presence. Our UAVs integrate advanced sensor suites and robust motion planning algorithms to autonomously navigate and explore these complex environments. We validated our approach through comprehensive simulation experiments in PX4 Gazebo and Airsim Unreal Engine 4 environments. Real-world wind tests and exploration experiments demonstrate the UAVs' capability to operate stably under diverse environmental conditions without GPS assistance.

      <title>Learning Multi-Modal Whole-Body Control for Real-World Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Masked Humanoid Controller (MHC) for whole-body tracking of target trajectories over arbitrary subsets of humanoid state variables. This enables the realization of whole-body motions from diverse sources such as video, motion capture, and VR, while ensuring balance and robustness against disturbances. The MHC is trained in simulation using a carefully designed curriculum that imitates partially masked motions from a library of behaviors spanning pre-trained policy rollouts, optimized reference trajectories, re-targeted video clips, and human motion capture data. We showcase simulation experiments validating the MHC's ability to execute a wide variety of behavior from partially-specified target motions. Moreover, we also highlight sim-to-real transfer as demonstrated by real-world trials on the Digit humanoid robot. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a learned controller that can realize whole-body control of a real-world humanoid for such diverse multi-modal targets.</description>

      <title>Narrowing your FOV with SOLiD: Spatially Organized and Lightweight Global Descriptor for FOV-constrained LiDAR Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We often encounter limited FOV situations due to various factors such as sensor fusion or sensor mount in real-world robot navigation. However, the limited FOV interrupts the generation of descriptions and impacts place recognition adversely. Therefore, we suffer from correcting accumulated drift errors in a consistent map using LiDAR-based place recognition with limited FOV. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for handling narrow FOV scenarios. The proposed method establishes spatial organization based on the range-elevation bin and azimuth-elevation bin to represent places. In addition, we achieve a robust place description through reweighting based on vertical direction information. Based on these representations, our method enables addressing rotational changes and determining the initial heading. Additionally, we designed a lightweight and fast approach for the robot's onboard autonomy. For rigorous validation, the proposed method was tested across various LiDAR place recognition scenarios (i.e., single-session, multi-session, and multi-robot scenarios). To the best of our knowledge, we report the first method to cope with the restricted FOV. Our place description and SLAM codes will be released. Also, the supplementary materials of our descriptor are available at \texttt{\url{https://sites.google.com/view/lidar-solid}}.</description>

      <title>Risk Occupancy: A New and Efficient Paradigm through Vehicle-Road-Cloud Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the 4D Risk Occupancy within a vehicle-road-cloud architecture, integrating the road surface spatial, risk, and temporal dimensions, and endowing the algorithm with beyond-line-of-sight, all-angles, and efficient abilities. The algorithm simplifies risk modeling by focusing on directly observable information and key factors, drawing on the concept of Occupancy Grid Maps (OGM), and incorporating temporal prediction to effectively map current and future risk occupancy.
  Compared to conventional driving risk fields and grid occupancy maps, this algorithm can map global risks more efficiently, simply, and reliably. It can integrate future risk information, adapting to dynamic traffic environments. The 4D Risk Occupancy also unifies the expression of BEV detection and lane line detection results, enhancing the intuitiveness and unity of environmental perception. Using DAIR-V2X data, this paper validates the 4D Risk Occupancy algorithm and develops a local path planning model based on it. Qualitative experiments under various road conditions demonstrate the practicality and robustness of this local path planning model. Quantitative analysis shows that the path planning based on risk occupation significantly improves trajectory planning performance, increasing safety redundancy by 12.5% and reducing average deceleration by 5.41% at an initial braking speed of 8 m/s, thereby improving safety and comfort. This work provides a new global perception method and local path planning method through Vehicle-Road-Cloud architecture, offering a new perceptual paradigm for achieving safer and more efficient autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Optimization Strategies to Design an Underactuated Hand Exoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoskeletons can boost human strength and provide assistance to individuals with physical disabilities. However, ensuring safety and optimal performance in their design poses substantial challenges. This study presents the design process for an underactuated hand exoskeleton (U-HEx), first including a single objective (maximizing force transmission), then expanding into multi objective (also minimizing torque variance and actuator displacement). The optimization relies on a Genetic Algorithm, the Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm, and their versions for multi-objective optimization. Analyses revealed that using Big Bang-Big Crunch provides high and more consistent results in terms of optimality with lower convergence time. In addition, adding more objectives offers a variety of trade-off solutions to the designers, who might later set priorities for the objectives without repeating the process - at the cost of complicating the optimization algorithm and computational burden. These findings underline the importance of performing proper optimization while designing exoskeletons, as well as providing a significant improvement to this specific robotic design.</description>

      <title>Object Augmentation Algorithm: Computing virtual object motion and object induced interaction wrench from optical markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the critical need for diverse and comprehensive data focused on human arm joint torques while performing activities of daily living (ADL). Previous studies have often overlooked the influence of objects on joint torques during ADL, resulting in limited datasets for analysis. To address this gap, we propose an Object Augmentation Algorithm (OAA) capable of augmenting existing marker-based databases with virtual object motions and object-induced joint torque estimations. The OAA consists of five phases: (1) computing hand coordinate systems from optical markers, (2) characterising object movements with virtual markers, (3) calculating object motions through inverse kinematics (IK), (4) determining the wrench necessary for prescribed object motion using inverse dynamics (ID), and (5) computing joint torques resulting from object manipulation. The algorithm's accuracy is validated through trajectory tracking and torque analysis on a 7+4 degree of freedom (DoF) robotic hand-arm system, manipulating three unique objects. The results show that the OAA can accurately and precisely estimate 6 DoF object motion and object-induced joint torques. Correlations between computed and measured quantities were &gt; 0.99 for object trajectories and &gt; 0.93 for joint torques. The OAA was further shown to be robust to variations in the number and placement of input markers, which are expected between databases. Differences between repeated experiments were minor but significant (p &lt; 0.05). The algorithm expands the scope of available data and facilitates more comprehensive analyses of human-object interaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaited Legged Locomotion with Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged robots are able to navigate complex terrains by continuously interacting with the environment through careful selection of contact sequences and timings. However, the combinatorial nature behind contact planning hinders the applicability of such optimization problems on hardware. In this work, we present a novel approach that optimizes gait sequences and respective timings for legged robots in the context of optimization-based controllers through the use of sampling-based methods and supervised learning techniques. We propose to bootstrap the search by learning an optimal value function in order to speed-up the gait planning procedure making it applicable in real-time. To validate our proposed method, we showcase its performance both in simulation and on hardware using a 22 kg electric quadruped robot. The method is assessed on different terrains, under external perturbations, and in comparison to a standard control approach where the gait sequence is fixed a priori.</description>

      <title>SigmaRL: A Sample-Efficient and Generalizable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source, decentralized framework named SigmaRL, designed to enhance both sample efficiency and generalization of multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for motion planning of connected and automated vehicles. Most RL agents exhibit a limited capacity to generalize, often focusing narrowly on specific scenarios, and are usually evaluated in similar or even the same scenarios seen during training. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges, including experience replay and regularization. However, how observation design in RL affects sample efficiency and generalization remains an under-explored area. We address this gap by proposing five strategies to design information-dense observations, focusing on general features that are applicable to most traffic scenarios. We train our RL agents using these strategies on an intersection and evaluate their generalization through numerical experiments across completely unseen traffic scenarios, including a new intersection, an on-ramp, and a roundabout. Incorporating these information-dense observations reduces training times to under one hour on a single CPU, and the evaluation results reveal that our RL agents can effectively zero-shot generalize.

      <title>NeuroEvolution algorithms applied in the designing process of biohybrid actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots diverge from traditional rigid robotics, offering unique advantages in adaptability, safety, and human-robot interaction. In some cases, soft robots can be powered by biohybrid actuators and the design process of these systems is far from straightforward. We analyse here two algorithms that may assist the design of these systems, namely, NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies) and HyperNEAT (Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies). These algorithms exploit the evolution of the structure of actuators encoded through neural networks. To evaluate these algorithms, we compare them with a similar approach using the Age Fitness Pareto Optimization (AFPO) algorithm, with a focus on assessing the maximum displacement achieved by the discovered biohybrid morphologies. Additionally, we investigate the effects of optimization against both the volume of these morphologies and the distance they can cover. To further accelerate the computational process, the proposed methodology is implemented in a client-server setting; so, the most demanding calculations can be executed on specialized and efficient hardware. The results indicate that the HyperNEAT-based approach excels in identifying morphologies with minimal volumes that still achieve satisfactory displacement targets.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Scale-aware Depth Estimation for Monocular Endoscopic Scenes with Geometric Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale-aware monocular depth estimation poses a significant challenge in computer-aided endoscopic navigation. However, existing depth estimation methods that do not consider the geometric priors struggle to learn the absolute scale from training with monocular endoscopic sequences. Additionally, conventional methods face difficulties in accurately estimating details on tissue and instruments boundaries. In this paper, we tackle these problems by proposing a novel enhanced scale-aware framework that only uses monocular images with geometric modeling for depth estimation. Specifically, we first propose a multi-resolution depth fusion strategy to enhance the quality of monocular depth estimation. To recover the precise scale between relative depth and real-world values, we further calculate the 3D poses of instruments in the endoscopic scenes by algebraic geometry based on the image-only geometric primitives (i.e., boundaries and tip of instruments). Afterwards, the 3D poses of surgical instruments enable the scale recovery of relative depth maps. By coupling scale factors and relative depth estimation, the scale-aware depth of the monocular endoscopic scenes can be estimated. We evaluate the pipeline on in-house endoscopic surgery videos and simulated data. The results demonstrate that our method can learn the absolute scale with geometric modeling and accurately estimate scale-aware depth for monocular scenes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we analyze and compare different movement sensors: micro-chip gesture-ID, leap motion, noitom mocap, and specially developed sensor for tapping and foot motion analysis. The main goal is to evaluate the accu-racy of measurements provided by the sensors. This study presents rele-vance, for instance, in tremor/Parkinson disease analysis as well as no touch mechanisms for activation and control of devices. This scenario is especially interesting in COVID-19 scenario. Removing the need to touch a surface, the risk of contagion is reduced.</description>

      <title>Resilient source seeking with robot swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a solution for locating the source, or maximum, of an unknown scalar field using a swarm of mobile robots. Unlike relying on the traditional gradient information, the swarm determines an ascending direction to approach the source with arbitrary precision. The ascending direction is calculated from measurements of the field strength at the robot locations and their relative positions concerning the centroid. Rather than focusing on individual robots, we focus the analysis on the density of robots per unit area to guarantee a more resilient swarm, i.e., the functionality remains even if individuals go missing or are misplaced during the mission. We reinforce the robustness of the algorithm by providing sufficient conditions for the swarm shape so that the ascending direction is almost parallel to the gradient. The swarm can respond to an unexpected environment by morphing its shape and exploiting the existence of multiple ascending directions. Finally, we validate our approach numerically with hundreds of robots. The fact that a large number of robots always calculate an ascending direction compensates for the loss of individuals and mitigates issues arising from the actuator and sensor noises.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are an increasingly integral part of modern factory and warehouse operations. Obstacle detection, avoidance and path planning are critical safety-relevant tasks, which are often solved using expensive LiDAR sensors and depth cameras. We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP. Overall, VIRUS-NeRF presents a promising approach for cost-effective local mapping in mobile robotics, with potential applications in safety and navigation tasks.

      <title>User-customizable Shared Control for Robot Teleoperation via Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared control can ease and enhance a human operator's ability to teleoperate robots, particularly for intricate tasks demanding fine control over multiple degrees of freedom. However, the arbitration process dictating how much autonomous assistance to administer in shared control can confuse novice operators and impede their understanding of the robot's behavior. To overcome these adverse side-effects, we propose a novel formulation of shared control that enables operators to tailor the arbitration to their unique capabilities and preferences. Unlike prior approaches to customizable shared control where users could indirectly modify the latent parameters of the arbitration function by issuing a feedback command, we instead make these parameters observable and directly editable via a virtual reality (VR) interface. We present our user-customizable shared control method for a teleoperation task in SE(3), known as the buzz wire game. A user study is conducted with participants teleoperating a robotic arm in VR to complete the game. The experiment spanned two weeks per subject to investigate longitudinal trends. Our findings reveal that users allowed to interactively tune the arbitration parameters across trials generalize well to adaptations in the task, exhibiting improvements in precision and fluency over direct teleoperation and conventional shared control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning continuously optimizes decision-making based on real-time feedback reward signals through continuous interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong adaptive and self-learning capabilities. In recent years, it has become one of the key methods to achieve autonomous navigation of robots. In this work, an autonomous robot navigation method based on reinforcement learning is introduced. We use the Deep Q Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) models to optimize the path planning and decision-making process through the continuous interaction between the robot and the environment, and the reward signals with real-time feedback. By combining the Q-value function with the deep neural network, deep Q network can handle high-dimensional state space, so as to realize path planning in complex environments. Proximal policy optimization is a strategy gradient-based method, which enables robots to explore and utilize environmental information more efficiently by optimizing policy functions. These methods not only improve the robot's navigation ability in the unknown environment, but also enhance its adaptive and self-learning capabilities. Through multiple training and simulation experiments, we have verified the effectiveness and robustness of these models in various complex scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Motion planning is a challenging task to generate safe and feasible trajectories in highly dynamic and complex environments, forming a core capability for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose DRAMA, the first Mamba-based end-to-end motion planner for autonomous vehicles. DRAMA fuses camera, LiDAR Bird's Eye View images in the feature space, as well as ego status information, to generate a series of future ego trajectories. Unlike traditional transformer-based methods with quadratic attention complexity for sequence length, DRAMA is able to achieve a less computationally intensive attention complexity, demonstrating potential to deal with increasingly complex scenarios. Leveraging our Mamba fusion module, DRAMA efficiently and effectively fuses the features of the camera and LiDAR modalities. In addition, we introduce a Mamba-Transformer decoder that enhances the overall planning performance. This module is universally adaptable to any Transformer-based model, especially for tasks with long sequence inputs. We further introduce a novel feature state dropout which improves the planner's robustness without increasing training and inference times. Extensive experimental results show that DRAMA achieves higher accuracy on the NAVSIM dataset compared to the baseline Transfuser, with fewer parameters and lower computational costs.</description>
