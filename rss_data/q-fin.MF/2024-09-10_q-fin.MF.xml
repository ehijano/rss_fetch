      <title>Boundary conditions at infinity for Black-Scholes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a numerical procedure for computing the prices of forward contracts, in which the underlying asset price is a Markovian local martingale. If the underlying process is a strict local martingale, multiple solutions exist for the corresponding Black-Scholes equations, and the derivative prices are characterized as the minimal solutions. When applying numerical methods that are set up on a finite grid, such as finite difference methods, additional spatial boundary conditions are required, which causes the solution to uniquely exist. In this case, the problem is reduced to specifying the boundary conditions. Our boundary condition is based on an expression of the derivative price at infinity in terms of those at finite values, and incorporates volatility behaviors beyond the boundary. The proposed procedure is demonstrated through numerical tests, which show that it outperforms the methods proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy-regularized robust optimal order execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of order execution is cast as a relative entropy-regularized robust optimal control problem in this article. The order execution agent's goal is to maximize an objective functional associated with his profit-and-loss of trading and simultaneously minimize the execution risk and the market's liquidity and uncertainty. We model the market's liquidity and uncertainty by the principle of least relative entropy associated with the market volume. The problem of order execution is made into a relative entropy-regularized stochastic differential game. Standard argument of dynamic programming yields that the value function of the differential game satisfies a relative entropy-regularized Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (rHJI) equation. Under the assumptions of linear-quadratic model with Gaussian prior, the rHJI equation reduces to a system of Riccati and linear differential equations. Further imposing constancy of the corresponding coefficients, the system of differential equations can be solved in closed form, resulting in analytical expressions for optimal strategy and trajectory as well as the posterior distribution of market volume. Numerical examples illustrating the optimal strategies and the comparisons with conventional trading strategies are conducted.</description>
