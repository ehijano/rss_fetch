      <title>Modeling coskewness with zero correlation and correlation with zero coskewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that one needs to be careful when making statements on potential links between correlation and coskewness. Specifically, we first show that, on the one hand, it is possible to observe any possible values of coskewness among symmetric random variables but zero pairwise correlations of these variables. On the other hand, it is also possible to have zero coskewness and any level of correlation. Second, we generalize this result to the case of arbitrary marginal distributions showing the absence of a general link between rank correlation and standardized rank coskewness.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Delay Differential Equations have blow-up solutions if and only if their instantaneous counterparts have them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent publication by Ishiwata and Nakata (2022), we prove that sufficiently regular stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) with a single discrete delay have blow up solutions if and only if their undelayed counterparts have them, using a comparison theorem by Ikeda and Watanabe (1977). This result has applications in mathematical biology and finance.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic limit of fully coupled multi-scale non-linear stochastic system: the non-autonomous approximation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel argument, the non-autonomous approximation method, to seek the asymptotic limits of the fully coupled multi-scale McKean-Vlasov stochastic systems with irregular coefficients, which, as summarized in [3,Section 7], remains an open problem in the field. We provide an explicit characterization for the averaged limit of the non-linear stochastic system, where both the choice of the frozen equation and the definition of the averaged coefficients are more or less unexpected since new integral terms with respect to the measure variable appear. More importantly, in contrast with the classical theory of multi-scale systems which focuses on the averaged limit of the slow process, we propose a new perspective that the asymptotic behavior of the entire system is actually governed by the limit of the fast motion. By studying the long-time estimates of the solution of the Kolmogorov equation in Wasserstein space, we identify the limiting distribution of the fast motion of the non-linear system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is new even for the classical multi-scale It\^o SDEs. Furthermore, rates of convergence are also obtained, which are rather sharp and depend only on the regularity of the coefficients with respect to the slow variable. The innovation of our argument is to transform the non-linear system into a sequence of linear but non-autonomous systems, which is rather simple insofar as it avoids to involve the mean-field type PDEs associated with non-linear stochastic system, and at the same time, it turns out to be quite effective as it enables us to show that the strong convergence in the averaging principle of the non-linear stochastic system follows directly from the weak convergence, which significantly simplified the proof.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-expansion of the measure-current large deviations rate functional of non-reversible finite-state Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a sequence of continuous-time Markov chains $(X^{(n)}_t:t\ge 0)$ evolving on a fixed finite state space $V$. Let $I_n$ be the measure-current large deviations rate functional for $X^{(n)}_t$, as $t\to\infty$. Under a hypothesis on the jump rates, we prove that $I_n$ can be written as $I_n = \mathbf I^{(0)} \,+\, \sum_{1\le p\le \mathfrak q} (1/\theta^{(p)}_n) \, \mathbf I^{(p)}$ for some rate functionals $\mathbf I^{(p)}$. The weights $\theta^{(p)}_n$ correspond to the time-scales at which the sequence of Markov chains $X^{(n)}_t$ evolve among the metastable wells, and the rate functionals $\mathbf I^{(p)}$ characterise the asymptotic Markovian dynamics among these wells. This expansion provides therefore an alternative description of the metastable behavior of a sequence of Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum and Minimum of a Multivariate Poisson Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the maximum and minimum of multivariate Poisson distributions with three dependence structures, namely, the common shock, comonotonic shock and thinning-dependence models. In particular, we formulate the definition of a thinning-dependent multivariate Poisson distribution based on Wang and Yuen (2005). We derive explicit CDFs of the maximum and minimum of the multivariate Poisson random vectors and conduct asymptotic analyses on them. Our results reveal the substantial difference between the three dependence structures for multivariate Poisson distribution and may suggest an alternative method for studying the dependence for other multivariate distributions. We further provide numerical examples demonstrating obtained results.</description>

      <title>Functional Central limit theorems for microscopic and macroscopic functionals of inhomogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inhomogeneous random graphs with a finite type space. For a natural generalization of the model as a dynamic network-valued process, the paper achieves two objectives:
  (a) We establish functional central limit theorems for the infinite vector of microscopic type-densities and characterize the limits as infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes in a certain Banach space.
  (b) We establish (joint) functional central limit theorems for macroscopic observables of the giant component in the supercritical regime including size, surplus and number of vertices of various types in the giant component.
  Ongoing work seeks to extend these results to a broader class of inhomogeneous random graph models with general type spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally Markov walks are natural generalizations of classical Markov chains, where instead of a particle moving independently of the past, it decides where to move next depending on the last action performed at the current location. We introduce the concept of locally Markov walks on finite graphs and investigate several basic properties. For a particular locally Markov walk - the uniform unicycle walk on the complete graph - we investigate the mixing time and we prove that it exhibits cutoff.</description>

      <title>Higher-spin symmetry in the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ boundary Toda conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to studying the symmetries enjoyed by the probabilistic construction of the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ boundary Toda Conformal Field Theory. Namely we show that this model enjoys higher-spin symmetry in the form of Ward identities, higher equations of motion and under additional assumptions BPZ-type differential equations. To do so we consider the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Toda theory on the upper-half plane and rigorously define the descendant fields associated to the Vertex Operators. We then show that we can express local as well as global Ward identities based on them, for both the stress-energy tensor and the higher-spin current that encodes the $W$-symmetry. On the other hand, we show that specific Vertex Operators called degenerate fields give rise to singular vectors, which become higher equations of motion at the level of correlation functions. As a corollary we obtain BPZ-type differential equations satisfied by a family of correlation functions, which were unknown in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>The number of descendants in a preferential attachment graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the number $X^{(n)}$ of vertices that can be reached from the last added vertex $n$ via a directed path (the descendants) in the standard preferential attachment graph. In this model, vertices are sequentially added, each born with outdegree $m\ge 2$; the endpoint of each outgoing edge is chosen among previously added vertices with probability proportional to the current degree of the vertex plus some number $\rho$.
  We show that $X^{(n)}/n^\nu$ converges in distribution as $n\to\infty$, where $\nu$ depends on both $m$ and $\rho$, and the limiting distribution is given by a product of a constant factor and the $(1-\nu)$-th power of a Gamma(m/(m-1),1) variable. The proof uses a P\'olya urn representation of preferential attachment graphs, and the arguments of Janson (2024) where the same problem was studied in uniform attachment graphs. Further results, including convergence of all moments and analogues for the version with possible self-loops are provided.</description>

      <title>On Rio's proof of limit theorems for dependent random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an exposition of Rio's proof of the strong law of large numbers and extends his method to random fields. In addition to considering the rate of convergence in the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund strong law of large numbers, we go a step further by establishing (i) the Hsu--Robbins--Erd\"{o}s--Spitzer--Baum--Katz theorem, (ii) the Feller weak law of large numbers, and (iii) the Pyke--Root theorem on mean convergence for dependent random fields. These results significantly improve several particular cases in the literature. The proof is based on new maximal inequalities that hold for random fields satisfying a very general dependence structure.</description>

      <title>Computing Your Ideal Haircut Routine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce stochastically resetting deterministic processes -- the simplest subclass of general resetting stochastic processes -- finding them to be repackaged renewal processes. In particular, we consider the stochastically resetting deterministic process undergoing linear growth of rate 1 subject to Poissonian resetting and deduce its marginal, expectation, and variance. Then, using these results, we construct a stochastic model for hair growth subject to regular haircuts and use this model to prescribe the reader's ideal haircut routine.</description>

      <title>Some estimates for generalized Wigner matrix linear spectral statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the characteristic function of linear spectral statistics of generalized Wigner matrices. We provide an expansion of the characteristic function with error $\mathcal{O} ( N^{-1})$ around its limiting Gaussian form, and identify sub-leading non-Gaussian corrections of size $\mathcal{O} (N^{-1/2})$. Prior expansions with this error rate held only for Wigner matrices; only a weaker error rate was available for more general matrix ensembles. We provide some applications.</description>

      <title>Network Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) is a powerful theoretical framework developed to consistently transform the description of configurations of systems with many degrees of freedom, along with the associated model parameters and coupling constants, across different levels of resolution. It also provides a way to identify critical points of phase transitions and study the system's behaviour around them by distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant details, the latter being unnecessary to describe the emergent macroscopic properties. In traditional physical applications, the RG largely builds on the notions of homogeneity, symmetry, geometry and locality to define metric distances, scale transformations and self-similar coarse-graining schemes. More recently, various approaches have tried to extend RG concepts to the ubiquitous realm of complex networks where explicit geometric coordinates do not necessarily exist, nodes and subgraphs can have very different properties, and homogeneous lattice-like symmetries are absent. The strong heterogeneity of real-world networks significantly complicates the definition of consistent renormalization procedures. In this review, we discuss the main attempts, the most important advances, and the remaining open challenges on the road to network renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mean-field limit of the 1D bosonic canonical ensemble in a superharmonic trap. This is the regime with temperature proportional to particle number, both diverging to infinity, and correspondingly scaled interactions. We prove that the limit model is a classical field theory based on a non-linear Schr{\"o}dinger-Gibbs measure conditioned on the L2 mass, thereby obtaining a canonical analogue of previous results for the grand-canonical ensemble. We take advantage of this set-up with fixed mass to include focusing/attractive interactions/non-linearities in our study.</description>

      <title>Disease Progression Modelling and Stratification for detecting sub-trajectories in the natural history of pathologies: application to Parkinson's Disease trajectory modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling the progression of Degenerative Diseases (DD) is essential for detection, prevention, and treatment, yet it remains challenging due to the heterogeneity in disease trajectories among individuals. Factors such as demographics, genetic conditions, and lifestyle contribute to diverse phenotypical manifestations, necessitating patient stratification based on these variations. Recent methods like Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) have advanced unsupervised stratification of disease trajectories, but they face potential limitations in robustness, interpretability, and temporal granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce Disease Progression Modelling and Stratification (DP-MoSt), a novel probabilistic method that optimises clusters of continuous trajectories over a long-term disease time-axis while estimating the confidence of trajectory sub-types for each biomarker. We validate DP-MoSt using both synthetic and real-world data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Our results demonstrate that DP-MoSt effectively identifies both sub-trajectories and subpopulations, and is a promising alternative to current state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last twenty years, Lewis Bowen's sofic entropy and its annealed version (originally called the `f-invariant') have taken a central place in the ergodic theory of actions of non-amenable groups. In this work we pursue these notions of entropy across the analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. We find connections to both classical constructs in operator theory and the study of tuples of independent random unitary matrices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Exact Recovery in Semi-Supervised Learning: A Study of Spectral Methods and Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We delve into the challenge of semi-supervised node classification on the Contextual Stochastic Block Model (CSBM) dataset. Here, nodes from the two-cluster Stochastic Block Model (SBM) are coupled with feature vectors, which are derived from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that corresponds to their respective node labels. With only a subset of the CSBM node labels accessible for training, our primary objective becomes the accurate classification of the remaining nodes. Venturing into the transductive learning landscape, we, for the first time, pinpoint the information-theoretical threshold for the exact recovery of all test nodes in CSBM. Concurrently, we design an optimal spectral estimator inspired by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the training labels and essential data from both the adjacency matrix and feature vectors. We also evaluate the efficacy of graph ridge regression and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) on this synthetic dataset. Our findings underscore that graph ridge regression and GCN possess the ability to achieve the information threshold of exact recovery in a manner akin to the optimal estimator when using the optimal weighted self-loops. This highlights the potential role of feature learning in augmenting the proficiency of GCN, especially in the realm of semi-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Random permutations acting on $k$--tuples have near--optimal spectral gap for $k=\mathrm{poly}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r$, the random $2r$--regular Schreier graphs depicting the action of $r$ random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ are a.a.s. weakly Ramanujan, for any $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{12}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random matrices in irreducible representations of $S_{n}$ of quasi--exponential dimension.
  We also give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</description>

      <title>Clique and cycle frequencies in a sparse random graph model with overlapping communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.12827v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A statistical network model with overlapping communities can be generated as a superposition of mutually independent random graphs of varying size. The model is parameterized by the number of nodes, the number of communities, and the joint distribution of the community size and the edge probability. This model admits sparse parameter regimes with power-law limiting degree distributions and non-vanishing clustering coefficients. This article presents large-scale approximations of clique and cycle frequencies for graph samples generated by the model, which are valid for regimes with unbounded numbers of overlapping communities. Our results reveal the growth rates of these subgraph frequencies and show that their theoretical densities can be reliably estimated from data.</description>

      <title>Locally uniform random permutations with large increasing subsequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the maximal size of an increasing subset among points randomly sampled from certain probability densities. Kerov and Vershik's celebrated result states that the largest increasing subset among $N$ uniformly random points on $[0,1]^2$ has size asymptotically $2\sqrt{N}$. More generally, the order $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ still holds if the sampling density is continuous. In this paper we exhibit two sufficient conditions on the density to obtain a growth rate equivalent to any given power of $N$ greater than $\sqrt{N}$, up to logarithmic factors. Our proofs use methods of slicing the unit square into appropriate grids, and investigating sampled points appearing in each box.</description>

      <title>A test of a conjecture of Cardy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reference to Werner's measure on self-avoiding loops on Riemann surfaces, Cardy conjectured a formula for the measure of all homotopically nontrivial loops in a finite type annular region with modular parameter $\rho$. Ang, Remy and Sun have announced a proof of this conjecture using random conformal geometry. Cardy's formula implies that the measure of the set of homotopically nontrivial loops in $\mathbb C^{\times}$ which intersect $S^1$ equals $\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}}$. This set is the disjoint union of the set of loops which avoid a ray from the unit circle to infinity and its complement. There is an inclusion/exclusion sum which, in a limit, calculates the measure of the set of loops which avoid a ray. Each term in the sum involves finding the transfinite diameter of a slit domain. This is numerically accessible using the remarkable Schwarz-Christoffel package developed by Driscoll and Trefethen. Our calculations suggest this sum is around $\pi$, consistent with Cardy's formula.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality of Log Likelihood Ratio and Fundamental Limit of the Weak Detection for Spiked Wigner Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00821v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting the presence of a signal in a rank-one spiked Wigner model. For general non-Gaussian noise, assuming that the signal is drawn from the Rademacher prior, we prove that the log likelihood ratio (LR) of the spiked model against the null model converges to a Gaussian when the signal-to-noise ratio is below a certain threshold. The threshold is optimal in the sense that the reliable detection is possible by a transformed principal component analysis (PCA) above it. From the mean and the variance of the limiting Gaussian for the log-LR, we compute the limit of the sum of the Type-I error and the Type-II error of the likelihood ratio test. We also prove similar results for a rank-one spiked IID model where the noise is asymmetric but the signal is symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04039v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of conditional expectations in free random variables and provide closed formulas for the conditional expectation of resolvents of arbitrary non-commutative polynomials in free random variables onto the subalgebra of an arbitray subset of the variables. More precisely, given a linearization of the resolvent we compute a linearization of its conditional expectation. The coefficients of the expressions obtained in this process involve certain Boolean cumulant functionals which can be computed by solving a system of equations. On the way towards the main result we introduce a non-commutative differential calculus which allows to evaluate conditional expectations and the said Boolean cumulant functionals. We conclude the paper with several known and new examples which illustrate the working of the developed machinery and two appendices. The first appendix contains a purely algebraic approach to Boolean cumulants and the second appendix provides a crash course on linearizations of rational series.</description>

      <title>Metric Entropy-Free Sample Complexity Bounds for Sample Average Approximation in Convex Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00664v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies sample average approximation (SAA) in solving convex or strongly convex stochastic programming (SP) problems. Under some common regularity conditions, we show -- perhaps for the first time -- that SAA's sample complexity can be completely free from any quantification of metric entropy (such as the logarithm of the covering number), leading to a significantly more efficient rate with dimensionality $d$ than most existing results. From the newly established complexity bounds, an important revelation is that SAA and the canonical stochastic mirror descent (SMD) method, two mainstream solution approaches to SP, entail almost identical rates of sample efficiency, lifting a theoretical discrepancy of SAA from SMD by the order of $O(d)$. Furthermore, this paper explores non-Lipschitzian scenarios where SAA maintains provable efficacy but the corresponding results for SMD remain mostly unexplored, indicating the potential of SAA's better applicability in some irregular settings.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Random Evolution Equations of Parabolic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an abstract framework to obtain convergence rates for the approximation of random evolution equations corresponding to a random family of forms determined by finite-dimensional noise. The full discretization error in space, time, and randomness is considered, where polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used for the semi-discretization in randomness. The main result are regularity conditions on the random forms under which convergence of polynomial order in randomness is obtained depending on the smoothness of the coefficients and the Sobolev regularity of the initial value. In space and time, the same convergence rates as in the deterministic setting are achieved. To this end, we derive error estimates for vector-valued PCE as well as a quantified version of the Trotter--Kato theorem for form-induced semigroups. We apply the abstract framework to an anisotropic diffusion model with random diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Generation of Random (Generalized) Orthogonal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic method for generating random orthogonal matrices \(A\) that satisfy the property \(A^t S A = S\), where \(S\) is a fixed real invertible symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix. This method is significant as it generalizes the procedures for generating orthogonal matrices that fix a general fixed symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms. The implementation of our algorithms can be accomplished using standard linear algebra libraries.</description>
