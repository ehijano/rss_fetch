      <title>Bipolar nanochannels: The effects of an electro-osmotic instability. Part I: Steady-state response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady-state current-voltage response of ion-selective systems varies as the number of ion-selective components is varied. For the highly investigated unipolar system, including only one ion-selective component, it has been shown that above a supercritical voltage, an electroosmotic instability is triggered, leading to over-limiting currents. In contrast, the effects of this instability on the current-voltage response of the second most common system of a bipolar system, including two oppositely charged permselective regions, have yet to be reported. Using simulations, we investigate the steady-state electrical response of bipolar systems as we vary the ratio of the charge within the two oppositely charged regions. The responses are divided into those with an internal symmetry related to the surface charge and those without. In contrast to the unipolar systems, bipolar systems with the internal symmetry do not exhibit overlimiting currents, and their steady-state response is identical to the convectionless steady-state response. In contrast, the systems without the internal symmetry exhibit much more complicated behavior. For positive voltages, they have overlimiting currents, while for negative voltages, they do not have over-limiting currents. Our findings contribute to a more profound understanding of the behavior of the current-voltage response in bipolar systems.</description>

      <title>Bipolar nanochannels: The effects of an electro-osmotic instability. Part II: Time-transient response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most common method to characterize the electrical response of a nanofluidic system is through its steady-state current-voltage response. In Part I, we demonstrated that this current-voltage response depends on the geometry, the layout of the surface charge, and the effects of advection. We demonstrated that each configuration has a unique steady-state signature. Here, we will elucidate the behavior of the time-transient response. Similar to the steady-state response, we will show that each configuration has its own unique time-transient signature when subjected to electroosmotic instability. We show that bipolar systems behave differently than unipolar systems. In unipolar systems, the instability appears only at one end of the system. In contrast, in bipolar systems the instability will either appear on both sides of the nanochannel or not at all. If it does appear on both sides, the instability will eventually vanish on one or both sides of the system. In Part I, these phenomena were explained using steady-state considerations of the behavior of the fluxes. Here, we will examine the time-transient behavior to reveal the governing principles that are, on the one hand, not so different from unipolar systems and, on the other hand, remarkably different.</description>

      <title>Berry Phases in the Bosonization of Nonlinear Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider chiral, generally nonlinear density waves in one dimension, modelling the bosonized edge modes of a two-dimensional fermionic topological insulator. Using the coincidence between bosonization and Lie-Poisson dynamics on an affine U(1) group, we show that wave profiles which are periodic in time produce Berry phases accumulated by the underlying fermionic field. These phases can be evaluated in closed form for any Hamiltonian, and they serve as a diagnostic of nonlinearity. As an explicit example, we discuss the Korteweg-de Vries equation, viewed as a model of nonlinear quantum Hall edge modes.</description>

      <title>Shift photocurrent vortices from topological polarization textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. Due to the unconventional nature of vdW ferroelectricity, these topological polar structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. Here we propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moir\'e materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are anti-parallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for the experimental detection of topological polarization structures.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Reward-Driven Tuning of Scanning Probe Microscopy: Towards Fully Automated Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the dawn of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), tapping or intermittent contact mode has been one of the most widely used imaging modes. Manual optimization of tapping mode not only takes a lot of instrument and operator time, but also often leads to frequent probe and sample damage, poor image quality and reproducibility issues for new types of samples or inexperienced users. Despite wide use, optimization of tapping mode imaging is an extremely hard problem, ill-suited to either classical control methods or machine learning. Here we introduce a reward-driven workflow to automate the optimization of SPM in the tapping mode. The reward function is defined based on multiple channels with physical and empirical knowledge of good scans encoded, representing a sample-agnostic measure of image quality and imitating the decision-making logic employed by human operators. This automated workflow gives optimal scanning parameters for different probes and samples and gives high-quality SPM images consistently in the attractive mode. This study broadens the application and accessibility of SPM and opens the door for fully automated SPM.</description>

      <title>Probing electron trapping by current collapse in GaN/AlGaN FETs utilizing quantum transport characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GaN is expected to be a key material for next-generation electronics due to its interesting properties. However, the current collapse poses a challenge to the application of GaN FETs to electronic devices. In this study, we investigate the formation of quantum dots in GaN FETs under the current collapse. By comparing the Coulomb diamond between standard measurements and those under current collapse, we find that the gate capacitance is significantly decreased by the current collapse. This suggests that the current collapse changes the distribution of trapped electrons at the device surface, which is reported in the previous study by operando X-ray spectroscopy. Also, we show external control of quantum dot formation, previously challenging in an FET structure, by using current collapse.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature contribution towards $ 1s-2p_{\pm} $ interlayer exciton ultrafast transition within a $R-WSe_{2}/MoSe_{2} $ heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the spectrum of interlayer neutral excitons in transition-metal-dichalcogenide WeSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers in the $R$-stacking configuration. Most saliently, we show that, similarly to neutral excitons and trions in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, the spectrum is sensitive to the Berry curvature and thus quantum-geometric effects underlying the electron and hole wave functions. Due to the spatial separation between the electron and hole constituting the exciton in different layers, the Berry-curvature-induced splitting of the between the $2p_+$ and the $2p_-$ exciton states is smaller than for monolayer excitons. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of the exciton spectra on the dielectric environment and the twist angle between the two layers. Finally, the long-lived moir\'e interlayer exciton ground state ($1s$) enhances the possibility of creating brightened $2p_{\pm}$ states using a circularly polarized medium-infrared probe from the $1s$ ground state. As a result, we determine the polarizability of the $1s-2p_{\pm}$ transition, following by two-level dressed model for the optical Stark effect.</description>

      <title>Nanocomposites of ferrocenyl-modified gold clusters and semiconducting polymers that integrate field-effect transistor and flash memory in a single neuromorphic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that electroactive thin films incorporating semiconducting polymers and deterministic functionalized gold nanoclusters (ncAu25) lead to integration of the functions of resistive memory device and field-effect transistor (FETs) within a single component (mem-transistor) in a neuromorphic system. Memristor functions originate from ferrocenyl-modified gold nanoclusters (ncAu25-Fc) embedded in polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) and devices optimized for maximum 1/0 'flash' memory effect are found to contain 15 wt% ncAu25-Fc. Integrated memristor and neuromorphic functions are obtained by replacing PMMA with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in the active layer, from which transistor effects are derived. Based on the energy band diagrams of ncAu25, PMMA and P3HT, percolation theory is used to explain the memristor 1/0 on/off ratio as a function of ncAu25-Fc concentration. The use of ncAu25-Fc with charge-tunable, ferrocene-modified, ligands is critical toward better cluster-polymer interfaces. Our work shows that nanostructures of polymers and metalorganic frameworks bear strong potential towards neuromorphic devices and the circuital simplification of data storage technology.</description>

      <title>High Performance MoS2 Phototransistors Photogated by PN Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photodetectors based on two-dimensional (2D) atomically thin semiconductors suffer from low light absorption, limiting their potential for practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance MoS2 phototransistors by integrating few-layer MoS2 on a PN junction formed in a silicon (Si) substrate. The photovoltage created in the PN junction under light illumination electrically gates the MoS2 channel, creating a strong photoresponse in MoS2. We present an analytical model for the photoresponse of our device and show that it is in good agreement with measured experimental photocurrent in MoS2 and photovoltage in the Si PN junction. This device structure separates light absorption and electrical response functions, which provides us an opportunity to design new types of photodetectors. For example, incorporating ferroelectric materials into the gate structure can produce a negative capacitance that boosts gate voltage, enabling low power, high sensitivity phototransistor; this, combined with separating light absorption and electrical functions, enables advanced high-performance photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Two-dimentional Weyl nodal-line semimetal and antihelical edge states in a modified Kane-Mele model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kane-Mele model has been modified to achieve versatile topological phases. Previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 156402 (2018)] introduced a staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling effect to generate pseudohelical edge states, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling facilitating spin flips in alternating sublattices. Our study demonstrates that, in the absence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the modified Kane-Mele model with staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling evolves into a $Z_{2}$ class topological metal, specifically a two-dimensional Weyl nodal-line semimetal. In a nanoribbon geometry, we predict the emergence of antihelical edge states, which support spin-polarized currents flowing in the same direction along parallel boundaries. Unlike pseudohelical edge states, antihelical edge states can be viewed as a superposition of two antichiral edge states related by time-reversal symmetry. However, the spin Hall conductance from antihelical edge states is not quantized due to the presence of gapless bulk states. Additionally, we examine the robustness of helical, pseudohelical, and antihelical edge states in the presence of nonmagnetic disorders, highlighting the particular fragility of antihelical edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of the modified Kane-Mele model, providing new insights into its topological properties.</description>

      <title>Curvature-induced parity loss and hybridization of magnons: Exploring the connection of flat and tubular magnetic shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the connection between flat and curvilinear magnetization dynamics. For this, we numerically study the evolution of the magnon spectrum of rectangular waveguides upon rolling its cross-section up to a full tube. Magnon spectra are calculated over a wide range of magnetization states using a finite-element dynamic-matrix method, which allows us to trace the evolution of the magnon frequencies and several critical magnetic fields with increasing curvature. By analyzing the parity of the higher-order magnon modes, we find a curvature-induced mode hetero-symmetry that originates from a chiral contribution to the exchange interaction and is related to the Berry phase of magnons in closed loops. Importantly, this curvature-induced parity loss has profound consequences for the linear coupling between different propagating magnons, allowing for hybridization between initially orthogonal modes. In this context, we demonstrate the integral role of edge modes in forming the magnon spectrum in full tubes. Our findings provide new theoretical insights into curvilinear magnetization dynamics and are relevant for interpreting and designing experiments in the field.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Transport Driven by Quantum Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric characteristics of Bloch wave functions play a crucial role in electronic transport properties. We show that the thermoelectric performance of materials is governed by the geometric structure of Bloch wave functions within the framework of the Boltzmann equation. The essential geometric notion is the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance, measuring the resemblance between two quantum states. We establish a geometric characterization of the scattering rate by extending the concept of quantum distance between two states in momentum space at a distance.Employing isotropic quadratic band touching semimetals, where one can concentrate on the role of quantum geometric effects other than the Berry curvature, we find that the response functions for electrical quantum transport and, therefore, the thermoelectric power factor can be succinctly expressed in terms of the maximum quantum distance, $d_\mathrm{max}$. Specifically, when $d_\mathrm{max}$ reaches one, the power factor doubles compared to the case with trivial geometry ($d_\mathrm{max}=0$). Our finding highlights the significance of quantum geometry in improving the performance of thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spin polarization induced by electric fields in an isotropic chiral metal with boundaries using the Boltzmann formalism. We calculate both spin polarization in bulk in the linear response and antiparallel spin polarization near the boundary in the quadratic response against electric fields. We also work out spin polarization induced by the fluctuating electric fields, i.e., noises. Based on these results, we address chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) without biased inputs, CISS at room temperature, and the enantio-selective interaction between chiral materials and a magnetic substrate.</description>

      <title>Emergence of tunable exceptional points in altermagnet-ferromagnet junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of exceptional points (EPs) ${-}$ where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors converge ${-}$ is a key characteristic of non-Hermitian physics. A newly-discovered class of magnets ${-}$ termed as altermagnets (AMs) ${-}$ are characterized by a net zero magnetization as well as spin-split bands. In this study, we propose the emergence of non-Hermitian physics at AM-ferromagnet (FM) junctions. We discover that such a junction hosts tunable EPs. We demonstrate that the positions of these emergent EPs can be tuned using an external applied magnetic field and show that for a critical value of the applied magnetic field the EPs can annihilate. Notably, the number and position of the EPs crucially depends on the type of AM and its orientation with respect to the FM. Our work puts forth a promising platform of exploration of non-Hermitian physics in an emerging class of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect: Interplay Between Diffusive and Intrinsic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of identifying experimental signatures of the orbital Hall effect (OHE), the research on the microscopic mechanisms behind this unique phenomenon is still in its infancy. Here, using a gapped 2D Dirac material as a model system of the OHE, we develop a microscopic theory of orbital transport which captures extrinsic disorder effects non-perturbatively. We show that it predicts several hitherto unknown effects, including (i) a strong dependence of the OHE conductivity with the strength and symmetry of the impurity scattering potential, and (ii) a smooth crossover from intrinsic to extrinsic OHE as a function of the Fermi energy. In contrast to previous (perturbative) studies, the OHE is found to exhibit bona fide diffusive behavior in the dilute impurity limit, which we trace back to the dominance of skew scattering-type processes. Our work unveils the crucial nature of nonperturbative vertex corrections for a correct description of extrinsic orbital Hall transport and confirms common short-range impurities as key enablers of the OHE.</description>

      <title>Role of scaling dimensions in generalized noises in fractional quantum Hall tunneling due to a temperature bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continued improvement of heat control in mesoscopic conductors brings novel tools for probing strongly correlated electron phenomena. Motivated by these advances, we comprehensively study transport due to a temperature bias in a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the charge-current noise (so-called delta-$T$ noise), heat-current noise, and mixed noise and elucidate how these observables can be used to infer strongly correlated properties of the device. Our main focus is the extraction of so-called scaling dimensions of the tunneling anyonic quasiparticles, of critical importance to correctly infer their anyonic exchange statistics.</description>

      <title>Modelling shallow confinement in tuneable quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a universal microscopic model for the shallow confinement regime of single-electron tunneling devices. We consider particle escape from a quantum well generically emerging as a bifurcation in a smooth electrostatic potential and develop a set of analytic and numerical approximations for the ground-state tunneling and thermally activated escape rates. These approximations are applied to the problem of electron capture by a closing tunnel barrier where the competition between the closing speed and the escape rate defines a scaling relation for the capture fidelity. Effective one-dimensional cubic potential approximation leads to a universal form of this scaling relation in terms of device-independent dimensionless depth and speed parameters. Using predictions for temperature and magnetic-field dependence we show how to infer the energy scales of cubic longitudinal and quadratic transverse confinement. Finally, we derive an intrinsic quantum speed bound for adiabatic protection of the ground state tunneling and show that the latter can potentially be exploited up to the break down of confinement with a practical speed limit set by reaching the quantum uncertainty of the barrier height before the onset of non-adiabatic excitation. These results contribute to mapping out the physical limits of single-electron quantum technologies for electrical metrology and sensing.</description>

      <title>Imprinting Ground State Chirality on Adatom Spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an alternative experimental protocol for the detection of doped Chern insulators and chiral superconductors. Our approach relies on coupling the target chiral system to adatom spins. Due to the substrate chirality, the adatom spins are expected to order in a noncoplanar configuration with a nonzero spin chirality. Here, we obtain concrete results for chiral substrates which are invariant under arbitrary spin rotations, and are coupled to three adatoms carrying classical moments. By exploring all the accessible magnetic ground states, we identify the regimes in which nonzero spin chirality is induced on the adatom complex. We apply our method to valley-polarized bilayer graphene and $d+id$ superconductors, and find qualitatively different ground state diagrams. Our analysis shows that the adatom spin chirality fully encodes the properties of the substrate chirality.</description>

Abstract: Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.</description>

      <title>Strain-driven stabilization of a room-temperature chiral ferroelectric</title>

Abstract: Noncollinear ferroic materials are sought after as testbeds to explore the intimate connections between topology and symmetry, which result in electronic, optical and magnetic functionalities not observed in collinear ferroic materials. For example, ferroaxial materials have ordered rotational structural distortions that break mirror symmetry and induce chirality. When ferroaxial order is coupled with ferroelectricity arising from a broken inversion symmetry, it offers the prospect of electric-field-control of the ferroaxial distortions and opens up new tunable functionalities. However, chiral ferroelectrics, especially ones stable at room temperature, are rare. We report the discovery of a strain-stabilized, room-temperature chiral ferroelectric phase in single crystals of BaTiS$_3$, a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) hexagonal chalcogenide. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the stabilization of this multiferroic phase having $P6_3$ space group for biaxial tensile strains exceeding 1.5% applied on the basal ab-plane of the room temperature $P6_3cm$ phase of BaTiS$_3$. The chiral ferroelectric phase is characterized by rotational distortions of select TiS$_6$ octahedra around the long $c$-axis and polar displacement of Ti atoms along the $c$-axis. We used an innovative approach using focused ion beam milling to make appropriately strained samples of BaTiS$_3$. The ferroaxial and ferroelectric distortions, and their domains in $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ were directly resolved using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Landau-based phenomenological modeling predicts a strong coupling between the ferroelectric and the ferroaxial order making $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ an attractive test bed for achieving electric-field control of chirality-related phenomena such as circular photo-galvanic current and the Rashba effect.</description>

      <title>A Metastable Pentagonal 2D Material Synthesized by Symmetry-Driven Epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most two-dimensional (2D) materials experimentally studied so far have hexagons as their building blocks. Only a few exceptions, such as PdSe2, are lower in energy in pentagonal phases and exhibit pentagons as building blocks. While theory has predicted a large number of pentagonal 2D materials, many of them are metastable and their experimental realization is difficult. Here we report the successful synthesis of a metastable pentagonal 2D material, the monolayer pentagonal PdTe2, by symmetry-driven epitaxy. Scanning tunneling microscopy and complementary spectroscopy measurements are used to characterize the monolayer pentagonal PdTe2, which demonstrates well-ordered low-symmetry atomic arrangements and is stabilized by lattice matching with the underlying Pd(100) substrate. Theoretical calculations, along with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, reveal monolayer pentagonal PdTe2 is a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 1.05 eV. Our work opens an avenue for the synthesis of pentagon-based 2D materials and gives opportunities to explore their applications such as multifunctional nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Exotic thermoelectric properties of coronene-cyclobutadienoid graphene nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials traditionally incorporate heavy metals to achieve low lattice thermal conductivity. However, elements such as Te, Bi, and Pb are costly and pose environmental hazards. In this study, we introduce a novel design strategy for thermoelectric materials, focusing on room-temperature, light-element, and high-ZT materials such as coronene-cyclobutadienoid graphene nanoribbons (cor4GNRs). This material demonstrates a ZT value exceeding 2.1, attributed to its exceptionally low phonon thermal conductivity resulting from its unique edge structure. Importantly, its electrical conductance and Seebeck coefficient remain relatively high and nearly unaffected by the edge structure. This distinct behavior in phonon and electronic transport properties leads to a remarkably high ZT value. Additionally, we discover that applying strain can significantly reduce phonon thermal conductivity, potentially increasing the ZT value to over 3.0. Our findings provide innovative insights for the design and application of advanced thermoelectric materials.</description>

Abstract: Discovering mixed state quantum orders is an on-going issue. Recently, it has been recognized that there are (at least) two kinds of symmetries in the mixed state; strong and weak symmetries. Under symmetry-respective decoherence, spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) can occur. This work provides a scheme to describe SSSB and other decoherence phenomena in the mixed state by employing the stabilizer formalism and the efficient numerical algorithm of Clifford circuits. We present two systematic numerical studies. In a two-dimensional (2D) circuit with a stochastic Ising type decoherence, an SSSB phase transition is clearly observed and its criticality is elucidated by the numerical methods. In particular, we calculate R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations and estimate critical exponents of the SSSB transition. For the second system, we introduce an idea of subsystem SSSB. As an example, we study a system with symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) order provided by both one-form and zero-form symmetries, and observe how the system evolves under decoherence. After displaying numerical results, we show that viewpoint of percolation is quite useful to understand the SSSB transition, which is applicable for a wide range of decohered states. Finally, we comment on SSSB of one-form-symmetry exemplifying toric code.</description>

      <title>Easy Access to Bright Oxygen Defects in Biocompatible Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes via a Fenton-Like Reaction</title>

Abstract: The covalent functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with luminescent oxygen defects increases their brightness and enables their application as optical biosensors or fluorescent probes for in-vivo imaging in the second-biological window (NIR-II). However, obtaining luminescent defects with high brightness is challenging with the current functionalization methods due to a restricted window of reaction conditions or the necessity for controlled irradiation with ultraviolet light. Here we report a method for introducing luminescent oxygen defects via a Fenton-like reaction that uses benign and inexpensive chemicals without light irradiation. (6,5) SWNTs in aqueous dispersion functionalized with this method show bright $E_{11}$* emission (1105 nm) with 3.2-times higher peak intensities than the pristine $E_{11}$ emission and a reproducible photoluminescence quantum yield of 3%. The functionalization can be performed within a wide range of reaction parameters and even with unsorted nanotube raw material at high concentrations (100 mg/L), giving access to large amounts of brightly luminescent SWNTs. We further find that the introduced oxygen defects rearrange under light irradiation, which gives additional insights into the structure and dynamics of oxygen defects. Finally, the functionalization of ultra-short SWNTs with oxygen defects also enables high photoluminescence quantum yields and their excellent emission properties are retained after surfactant exchange with biocompatible pegylated phospholipids or single-stranded DNA to make them suitable for in-vivo NIR-II imaging and dopamine sensing.</description>

Abstract: Water's ability to autoionize into hydroxide and hydronium ions profoundly influences surface properties, rendering interfaces either basic or acidic. While it is well-established that the water-air interface is acidic, a critical knowledge gap exists in technologically relevant surfaces like the graphene-water interface. Here we use machine learning-based simulations with first-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of the hydroxide and hydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that the graphene-water interface is acidic, with the hydronium ion predominantly residing in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion exhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and towards the interior layers. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals strong polarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement. Proton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation of surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for ion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.</description>

      <title>Characteristic times for gap relaxation and heat escape in nanothin NbTi superconducting filaments: thickness dependence and effect of substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measured the temporal voltage response of NbTi superconducting filaments with varied nanoscale thicknesses to step current pulses that induce non-equilibrium superconducting states governed by a hot-spot mechanism. Such detected voltage emerges after a delay time td, which is intimately connected to the gap relaxation and heat escape times. By employing time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory to link the delay time to the applied current, we determined that the gap relaxation time depends linearly on film thickness, aligning with the acoustic mismatch theory for phonon transmission at the superconductor-substrate interface. We thereby find a gap relaxation time of 104 ps per nm of thickness for NbTi films on polished sapphire. We further show that interfacial interaction with the substrate significantly impacts the gap relaxation time, with observed values of 9 ns on SiOx, 6.8 ns on fused silica, and 5.2 ns on sapphire for a 50 nm thick NbTi strip at T = 5.75 K. These insights are valuable for optimizing superconducting sensing technologies, particularly the single-photon detectors that operate in the transient regime of nanothin superconducting bridges and filaments</description>

      <title>Understanding the Optoelectronic Processes in Colloidal 2D Multi-Layered MAPbBr3 Perovskite Nanosheets: Funneling, Recombination and Self-Trapped Excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi two-dimensional (2D) colloidal synthesis made quantum confinement readily accessible in perovskites, generating additional momentum in perovskite LED research and lasing. Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton binding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for solar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different thickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker layers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms by which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures is lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n = 3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n &gt; 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives comprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination processes. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes dominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5, Eb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their exciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative recombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping processes, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping when high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n regions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is bypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.</description>

Abstract: Due to presence of magnetic field gradient needed for coherent spin control, dephasing of single-electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dots is often dominated by $1/f$ charge noise. We investigate theoretically fluctuations of ground state energy of an electron in gated quantum dot in realistic Si/SiGe structure. We assume that the charge noise is caused by motion of charges trapped at the semiconductor-oxide interface. We consider a realistic range of trapped charge densities, $\rho \! \sim \! 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical lenghtscales of isotropically distributed displacements of these charges, $\delta r \! \leq \! 1$ nm, and identify pairs $(\rho,\delta r)$ for which the amplitude and shape of the noise spectrum is in good agreement with spectra reconstructed in recent experiments on similar structures.</description>

Abstract: Here we present a theoretical analysis (applicable to all twist angles of TBG) of band dispersion and density of states in TBG relating evolution of flat band and Van-Hove singularities with evolution of interlayer coupling in TBG. A simple tight binding Hamiltonian with environment dependent interlayer hopping and incorporated with internal configuration of carbon atoms inside a supercell is used to calculate band dispersion and density of states in TBG. Various Hamiltonian parameters and functional form of interlayer hopping applicable to a wide range of twist angles in TBG is estimated by fitting calculated dispersion and density of states with available experimentally observed dispersion and density of states in Graphene, AB-stacked bilayer graphene and some TBG systems. Computationally obtained band dispersion reveal that flat band in TBG occurs very close to Dirac point of graphene and only along linear dimension of two-dimensional wave vector space connecting two closest Dirac points of two graphene layers of TBG.</description>

      <title>Correlations of spin splitting and orbital fluctuations due to 1/f charge noise in the Si/SiGe Quantum Dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations of electric fields can change the position of a gate-defined quantum dot in a semiconductor heterostructure. In the presence of magnetic field gradient, these stochastic shifts of electron's wavefunction lead to fluctuations of electron's spin splitting. The resulting spin dephasing due to charge noise limits the coherence times of spin qubits in isotopically purified Si/SiGe quantum dots. We investigate the spin splitting noise caused by such process caused by microscopic motion of charges at the semiconductor-oxide interface. We compare effects of isotropic and planar displacement of the charges, and estimate their densities and typical displacement magnitudes that can reproduce experimentally observed spin splitting noise spectra. We predict that for defect density of $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, visible correlations between noises in spin splitting and in energy of electron's ground state in the quantum dot, are expected.</description>

Abstract: Adiabatic evolution is an emergent design principle for time modulated metamaterials, often inspired by insights from topological quantum computing such as braiding operations. However, the pursuit of classical adiabatic metamaterials is rooted in the assumption that classical and quantum adiabatic evolution are equivalent. We show that this is only true in the limit where the frequencies of all the bands are at infinite distance from $0$; and some instances of quantum adiabatic evolution, such as those containing zero modes, cannot be reproduced in classical systems. This is because mode coupling is fundamentally different in classical mechanics. We derive classical conditions to ensure adiabaticity and demonstrate that only under these conditions - which are different from quantum adiabatic conditions -, the single band Berry phase and Wilczek-Zee matrix for everywhere degenerate bands emerge as meaningful quantities encoding the geometry of classical adiabatic evolution. Finally, for general multiband systems we uncover a correction term in the non-Abelian gauge potential for classical systems.</description>

Abstract: The quantum theory of polariton condensation in a trapped state reveals a second-order phase transition evidenced by spontaneous polarization parity breaking in sub-spaces of fixed polariton occupation numbers. The emission spectra of a polariton condensate demonstrate the coexistence of a symmetry-conserving condensate state with {linear} polarization and two symmetry-broken elliptically polarized states in the vicinity of the threshold. As a result, an oscillating linearly polarized second-order coherence $g^{(2)}_{xx}(t)$, with $g^{(2)}_{xx}(t)&lt;1$ over some time intervals is obtained. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is reflected in the second-order cross correlator of circular polarizations. A related build-up of elliptically-polarized weak lasing also results in non-monotonous dependence of the circular second-order coherence on excitation power and interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Acousto-drag photovoltaic effect by piezoelectric integration of two-dimensional semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-to-electricity conversion is crucial for energy harvesting and photodetection, requesting efficient electron-hole pair separation to prevent recombination. Traditional junction-based mechanisms using built-in electric fields fail in non-barrier regions. Homogeneous material harvesting under photovoltaic effect is appealing but only realized in non-centrosymmetric systems via bulk photovoltaic effect. Here we report the realization of photovoltaic effect by employing surface acoustic waves (SAW) to generate zero-bias photocurrent in a conventional layered semiconductor MoSe2. SAW induces periodic modulation to electronic bands and drags the photoexcited pairs toward the travelling direction. The photocurrent is extracted by a local barrier. The separation of generation and extraction processes suppresses recombination and yields large nonlocal photoresponse. We distinguish acousto-electric drag and electron-hole pair separation effect by fabricating devices of different configurations. The acousto-drag photovoltaic effect, enabled by piezoelectric integration, offers an efficient light-to-electricity conversion method, independent of semiconductor crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Magnonic $\varphi$ Josephson junctions and synchronized precession</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian physics. One of its main goals is to engineer dissipation and to explore ensuing functionality. In magnonics, the effect of dissipation due to local damping on magnon transport has been explored. However, the effects of non-local damping on the magnonic analog of the Josephson effect remain missing, despite that non-local damping is inevitable and has been playing a central role in magnonics. Here, we uncover theoretically that a surprisingly rich dynamics can emerge in magnetic junctions due to intrinsic non-local damping, using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, under microwave pumping, we show that coherent spin precession in the right and left insulating ferromagnet (FM) of the junction becomes synchronized by non-local damping and thereby a magnonic analog of the $\varphi$ Josephson junction emerges, where $\varphi$ stands here for the relative precession phase of right and left FM in the stationary limit. Remarkably, $\varphi$ decreases monotonically from $ \pi$ to $\pi/2$ as the magnon-magnon interaction, arising from spin anisotropies, increases. Moreover, we also find a magnonic diode effect giving rise to rectification of magnon currents. Our predictions are readily testable with current device and measurement technologies at room temperatures.</description>

      <title>Direct demonstration of bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order topological superconductors with chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A higher-order topological superconductor can experience topological phase transitions driven by variations in a bulk parameter without closing the bulk gap. This presents a challenge in establishing a direct bulk-boundary correspondence, as conventional bulk invariants change only upon the closure of the bulk gap. Our study of two-dimensional higher-order phases in the DIII and BDI symmetry classes, both characterized by chiral symmetry, demonstrates that zero-energy crossings facilitate a direct connection between the bulk Hamiltonian and Majorana zero modes at corners. These crossings, emerging as boundary conditions vary, can be identified from the bulk Hamiltonian. For both classes, we introduce a pair of topological invariants derived from these zero-energy crossings to characterize the higher-order topology. Phases in which at least one invariant assumes a nonzero value are anticipated to host Majorana corner modes. Moreover, these invariants may change with the closure of either bulk or edge gaps, thereby providing a clear and direct demonstration of bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order phases. Our findings offer a promising framework for systematically exploring higher-order topology through boundary condition modulation.</description>

Abstract: We show that the combined effects of dynamical Coulomb blockade and integer quantum Hall effect in a coupled hybrid metal-semiconductor setup provide a pathway for realizing resonant tunneling in Luttinger liquids. This hybrid setup can be brought to the quantum critical regime by varying gate voltages and contact resistances. We explore the nature of quantum criticality, Kondo effect, charge fractionalization and transport in such a hybrid setup, and verify their robust non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Our work opens a promising route for quantum simulating exotic zero temperature quantum critical phenomena associated with Luttinger liquid physics in a nanoengineered electronic circuit with well-defined quantum Hall channels.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a room temperature, all-electric device that reaches a strong coupling regime where external environmental coupling dominates over internal mechanical dissipation. The device has four orders of magnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal, and achieves a position imprecision rivaling an optical interferometer. With the help of a back-action isolation scheme, we observe radiative cooling of mechanical motion by a remote cryogenic load.</description>

      <title>Systematic compactification of the two-channel Kondo model. I. Consistent bosonization-debosonization approach and exact comparisons</title>

Abstract: Capitalizing on recent work, that clarifies the consistent use of bosonization-debosonization methods to study Kondo-type quantum impurity models even in nonequilibrium settings, we revisit the compactification procedure of the two-channel Kondo model (by which it is rewritten more ``compactly'' using the single-channel version of the model and exploiting separation and duality between spin and charge) and uncover some hidden approximations that could limit its range of validity. This complements and extends, for two or any even number of channels, beyond previous work on the Toulouse limit of these models, and reinforces the need for the use of an extended framework in these calculations. We carry out a number of exact comparisons between the different models, and show that keeping track of the, so-called, consistency factors leads to full agreement between the compactified and original versions of the model.</description>

Abstract: Following up on the systematic compactification of the two-channel Kondo model (and its multichannel extensions; see $\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.03569}{\textsf{companion paper I}}$) and the demonstration of its validity over the past proposal of compactification, we resort to a study of scaling using Anderson's simple poor man's procedure to carry out a comparative study of these two and the original model. By doing so we unveil a universal agreement among the three models in how they flow upon scaling, and suggest the general limits of such a concordance. In this way we further elucidate the conditions under which the standard simplifications implicit in many bosonization-based mappings (particularly of quantum impurity models) can be used reliably, and when the consistent bosonization-debosonization approach is needed.</description>

Abstract: We carry out a field-theoretical renormalization group procedure based on the Callan-Symanzik equation to calculate the detailed flow for the (multi) two-channel Kondo model and its compactified versions. In doing so, we go beyond the universal terms in the beta function we obtained using poor man's scaling (see $\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.03590}{\textsf{companion paper II}}$) and culminate our analysis of how the compactified versions of the model fare against the original one. Among other results, we explore the large-channel-number limit and extend our considerations to the finite temperature crossover region. Moreover, we gain insights into the contradistinction between the consistent vs. conventional bosonization-debosonization formalisms, thereby advancing our understanding on multiple fronts. In particular, we make use of renormalization-flow arguments to further justify the consistent refermionization of the parallel Kondo interaction we presented earlier (see $\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.03569}{\textsf{companion paper I}}$)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00873v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and optical conductivity in a two-valley system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical conductivity of a Fermi liquid (FL) in the absence of umklapp scattering is dramatically affected by the topology of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically, electron-electron (ee) scattering leads to rapid current relaxation in systems with multiple, or multiply connected, FSs, provided the valleys have different effective masses. This effect results from intervalley drag. We microscopically derive the optical conductivity of a two-valley system, both within the FL regime and near a quantum critical point (QCP) of the Ising-nematic type. In the FL regime, intervalley drag restores the Gurzhi-like scaling of the conductivity, $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^0$. This dependence contrasts sharply with the previously identified sub-leading contribution to the conductivity of a two-dimensional FL with a single convex FS, where $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^2 \ln |\omega|$. The vanishing of the leading term in the optical conductivity is a signature of geometric constraints on ee scattering channels, which are lifted for a multiply connected FS. A large differential response, $d \mathrm{Re} \sigma/d \mu$ with $\mu$ being the chemical potential, is predicted at the Lifshitz transition from a single-valley to a multi-valley FS, which should be observable within the experimentally accessible frequency range. Near a QCP, intervalley drag leads to a $|\omega|^{-2/3}$ scaling of $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega)$ in 2D, thus providing a specific current-relaxing process for this long-standing conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase diagram with the MBDL and delocalization states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase diagram. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL regime, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>
