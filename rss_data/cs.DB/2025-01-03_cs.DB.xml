      <title>Did we miss P In CAP? Partial Progress Conjecture under Asynchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Each application developer desires to provide its users with consistent results and an always-available system despite failures. Boldly, the CALM theorem disagrees. It states that it is hard to design a system that is both consistent and available under network partitions; select at most two out of these three properties. One possible solution is to design coordination-free monotonic applications. However, a majority of real-world applications require coordination. We resolve this dilemma by conjecturing that partial progress is possible under network partitions. This partial progress ensures the system appears responsive to a subset of clients and achieves non-zero throughput during failures. To this extent, we present the design of our CASSANDRA consensus protocol that allows partitioned replicas to order client requests.</description>

      <title>Towards Pattern-aware Data Augmentation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting missing facts for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) is a fundamental task, called temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC). One key challenge in this task is the imbalance in data distribution, where facts are unevenly spread across entities and timestamps. This imbalance can lead to poor completion performance or long-tail entities and timestamps, and unstable training due to the introduction of false negative samples. Unfortunately, few previous studies have investigated how to mitigate these effects. Moreover, for the first time, we found that existing methods suffer from model preferences, revealing that entities with specific properties (e.g., recently active) are favored by different models. Such preferences will lead to error accumulation and further exacerbate the effects of imbalanced data distribution, but are overlooked by previous studies. To alleviate the impacts of imbalanced data and model preferences, we introduce Booster, the first data augmentation strategy for TKGs. The unique requirements here lie in generating new samples that fit the complex semantic and temporal patterns within TKGs, and identifying hard-learning samples specific to models. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical scoring algorithm based on triadic closures within TKGs. By incorporating both global semantic patterns and local time-aware structures, the algorithm enables pattern-aware validation for new samples. Meanwhile, we propose a two-stage training approach to identify samples that deviate from the model's preferred patterns. With a well-designed frequency-based filtering strategy, this approach also helps to avoid the misleading of false negatives. Experiments justify that Booster can seamlessly adapt to existing TKGC models and achieve up to an 8.7% performance improvement.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Graph Neural Networks on Graph-level Tasks: Comprehensive Experiments, Analysis, and Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are essential data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which predict properties or classes for the entire graph, are critical for applications, such as molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in these tasks, but their evaluations are often limited to narrow datasets, tasks, and inconsistent experimental setups, restricting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified evaluation framework for graph-level GNNs. This framework provides a standardized setting to evaluate GNNs across diverse datasets, various graph tasks (e.g., graph classification and regression), and challenging scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Additionally, we propose a novel GNN model with enhanced expressivity and generalization capabilities. Specifically, we enhance the expressivity of GNNs through a $k$-path rooted subgraph approach, enabling the model to effectively count subgraphs (e.g., paths and cycles). Moreover, we introduce a unified graph contrastive learning algorithm for graphs across diverse domains, which adaptively removes unimportant edges to augment graphs, thereby significantly improving generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance against fourteen effective baselines across twenty-seven graph datasets, establishing it as a robust and generalizable model for graph-level tasks.</description>

      <title>Fides: Scalable Censorship-Resistant DAG Consensus via Trusted Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, consensus protocols based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) have gained significant attention due to their potential to build robust blockchain systems, particularly in asynchronous networks. In this paper, we propose Fides, an asynchronous DAG-based BFT consensus protocol that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to tackle three major scalability and security challenges faced by existing protocols: (i) the need for a larger quorum size (i.e., at least 3x larger) to tolerate Byzantine replicas, (ii) high communication costs and reliance on expensive cryptographic primitives (i.e., global common coin) to reach agreement in asynchronous networks, and (iii) poor censorship resilience undermining the liveness guarantee. Specifically, Fides adopts four trusted components-Reliable Broadcast, Vertex Validation, Common Coin, and Transaction Disclosure-within TEEs. Incorporating these components enables Fides to achieve linear message complexity, guaranteed censorship resilience, 2x larger quorum size, and lightweight common coin usage. Besides, abstracting these essential components rather than porting the entire protocol into TEE can significantly reduce the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Experimental evaluations of Fides in local and geo-distributed networks demonstrate its superior performance compared to established state-of-the-art protocols such as Tusk, RCC, HotStuff, and PBFT. The results indicate that Fides achieves a throughput of 400k transactions per second in a geo-distributed network and 810k transactions per second in a local network. Our analysis further explores the protocol's overhead, highlighting its suitability and effectiveness for practical deployment in real-world blockchain systems.</description>

      <title>GORAM: Graph-oriented ORAM for Efficient Ego-centric Queries on Federated Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ego-centric queries, focusing on a target vertex and its direct neighbors, are essential for various applications. Enabling such queries on graphs owned by mutually distrustful data providers, without breaching privacy, holds promise for more comprehensive results.
  In this paper, we propose GORAM, a graph-oriented data structure that enables efficient ego-centric queries on federated graphs with strong privacy guarantees. GORAM is built upon secure multi-party computation (MPC) and ensures that no single party can learn any sensitive information about the graph data or the querying keys during the process. However, achieving practical performance with privacy guaranteed presents a challenge. To overcome this, GORAM is designed to partition the federated graph and construct an Oblivious RAM(ORAM)-inspired index atop these partitions. This design enables each ego-centric query to process only a single partition, which can be accessed fast and securely.
  To evaluate the performance of GORAM, we developed a prototype querying engine on a real-world MPC framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with five commonly used queries on both synthetic and real-world graphs. Our evaluation shows that all benchmark queries can be completed in just 58.1 milliseconds to 35.7 seconds, even on graphs with up to 41.6 million vertices and 1.4 billion edges. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first instance of processing billion-scale graphs with practical performance on MPC.</description>

      <title>Federated Heavy Hitter Analytics with Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated heavy hitter analytics enables service providers to better understand the preferences of cross-party users by analyzing the most frequent items. As with federated learning, it faces challenges of privacy concerns, statistical heterogeneity, and expensive communication. Local differential privacy (LDP), as the de facto standard for privacy-preserving data collection, solves the privacy challenge by letting each user perturb her data locally and report the sanitized version. However, in federated settings, applying LDP complicates the other two challenges, due to the deteriorated utility by the injected LDP noise or increasing communication/computation costs by perturbation mechanism. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel target-aligning prefix tree mechanism satisfying $\epsilon$-LDP, for federated heavy hitter analytics. In particular, we propose an adaptive extension strategy to address the inconsistencies between covering necessary prefixes and estimating heavy hitters within a party to enhance the utility. We also present a consensus-based pruning strategy that utilizes noisy prior knowledge from other parties to further align the inconsistency between finding heavy hitters in each party and providing reasonable frequency information to identify the global ones. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first solution to the federated heavy hitter analytics in a cross-party setting while satisfying the stringent $\epsilon$-LDP. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.</description>

      <title>Mining Platoon Patterns from Traffic Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering co-movement patterns from urban-scale video data sources has emerged as an attractive topic. This task aims to identify groups of objects that travel together along a common route, which offers effective support for government agencies in enhancing smart city management. However, the previous work has made a strong assumption on the accuracy of recovered trajectories from videos and their co-movement pattern definition requires the group of objects to appear across consecutive cameras along the common route. In practice, this often leads to missing patterns if a vehicle is not correctly identified from a certain camera due to object occlusion or vehicle mis-matching. To address this challenge, we propose a relaxed definition of co-movement patterns from video data, which removes the consecutiveness requirement in the common route and accommodates a certain number of missing captured cameras for objects within the group. Moreover, a novel enumeration framework called MaxGrowth is developed to efficiently retrieve the relaxed patterns. Unlike previous filter-and-refine frameworks comprising both candidate enumeration and subsequent candidate verification procedures, MaxGrowth incurs no verification cost for the candidate patterns. It treats the co-movement pattern as an equivalent sequence of clusters, enumerating candidates with increasing sequence length while avoiding the generation of any false positives. Additionally, we also propose two effective pruning rules to efficiently filter the non-maximal patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the efficiency of MaxGrowth and the quality of its generated co-movement patterns. Our MaxGrowth runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm. It also demonstrates high accuracy in real video dataset when the trajectory recovery algorithm is not perfect.</description>
