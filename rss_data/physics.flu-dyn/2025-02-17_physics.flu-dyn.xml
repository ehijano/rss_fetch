      <title>Space-time proper orthogonal decomposition of actuation transients: plasma-controlled jet flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the forcing-induced transient between statistically stationary and cyclostationary states. The transient dynamics of a turbulent supersonic twin-rectangular jet flow, forced symmetrically at a Strouhal number of 0.9, are studied using synchronized large-eddy simulations (LES) and space-time proper orthogonal decomposition (space-time POD). Under plasma-actuated control, the statistically stationary jet evolves towards a cyclostationary state over a transient phase. Forcing-induced perturbations of the natural jet are extracted using synchronized simulations of the natural and forced jets. A database is collected that captures an ensemble of realizations of the perturbations within the initial transient. The spatiotemporal dynamics and statistics of the transient are analyzed using space-time POD for each symmetry component. The eigenvalue spectra unveil low-rank dynamics in the symmetric component. The spatial and temporal structures of the leading modes indicate that the initial pulse of the actuators produces large, impulsive perturbations to the flow field. The symmetric mode reveals the contraction of the shock cells due to the forcing, and shows the evolution of the mean flow deformation transient.</description>

      <title>The study of moving contact line dynamics at obtuse contact angles: An experimental investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow near a moving contact line is mainly governed by three key parameters: viscosity ratio, dynamic contact angle, and inertia. While the behavior of dynamic contact angles has been extensively investigated in earlier experimental and theoretical studies, very few studies have focused on flow configurations. The present study focuses on obtaining quantitative measurements of flow fields, interface shapes, and interfacial speeds in the low to moderate Reynolds number ($Re$) regimes using particle image velocimetry and image processing techniques. The study is restricted to dynamic contact angles greater than $90^{\circ}$. In the low $Re$ regime, excellent agreement of streamfunction contours, measured using flow fields, is found with the modified version of the viscous theory of Huh &amp; Scriven [1] that accounts for a curved interface. Theoretical models, such as DRG model, using a single fitting parameter, are shown to predict interface shapes accurately, even at finite $Re$. The interfacial speed, away from the contact line, compares favorably with the predictions of Huh &amp; Scriven. However, a rapid decrease in speed is observed near the contact line, unlike theoretical predictions. We argue that this rapid reduction in speed is critical to the resolution of the long-standing moving contact line singularity.</description>

      <title>Investigation of hydrogen under-expanded jets in gaseous propulsion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underexpanded jets are present in various engineering applications; in recent years, they have gained special attention because of the development of gaseous-fueled propulsion systems. In these apparatuses, the direct injection of fuels such as hydrogen in innovative low-emission engines' chambers induces turbulent under-expanded jets. In this study, we performed high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations of under-expanded hydrogen jets to investigate these flows and provide valuable insights for developing injectors suitable for hydrogen and, more generally, gaseous-fueled propulsion systems. We initially assessed the method's accuracy, evaluating the convergence and uncertainty of the numerical results and validating them against experimental particle image velocimetry and Schlieren data. The simulated jets, the Mach disc dimensions, and the resulting velocity field align closely with the experimental observations. Then we analyzed the jet structure for pressure ratios of 4 to 25 and examined the effects of the geometrical configuration of the nozzle on the characteristics of the air-fuel mixture obtained. We compared the jets resulting from a round-hole nozzle with annular ones resembling outward-opening injectors.</description>

      <title>On the use of an advanced Kirchhoff rod model to study mooring lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the application of an advanced nonlinear torsion- and shear-free Kirchhoff rod model, enhanced with a penalty-based barrier function (to simulate the seabed contact), intended for studying the static and dynamic behavior of mooring lines. The formulation incorporates conservative and non-conservative external loads, including those coming from the surrounding flow (added mass, tangential drag, and normal drag). To illustrate the favorable features of this model, we consider some key scenarios such as static configurations, pulsating force applications at the fairlead, and fluid-structure interaction between mooring lines and the surrounding flow. Verification against well-established solutions, including catenary configurations and OpenFAST simulations, shows excellent accuracy in predicting mooring line responses for a floating offshore wind turbine. Among the most important results, we can mention that under normal pulsating loads at the fairlead, the mooring line exhibits a transition from a drag-dominated regime at low frequencies to an added-mass-dominated regime at higher frequencies. Furthermore, tangential forcing at the fairlead reveals a strong coupling between axial and bending dynamics, contrasting with normal forcing scenarios where axial dynamics remain largely unaffected. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed approach for advanced mooring line simulations.</description>

      <title>Balloon regime: Drop elasticity leads to complete rebound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a viscoelastic shear-thinning drop of high elasticity hits a superhydrophobic surface, a growing tail-like filament vertically emerges from the impact spot as the contact line recedes. Notably, the ligament transitions into a balloon-like shape before detaching (Balloon regime) completely from the surface. Here, we attribute the ligament formation to the liquid impalement upon impact into the surface protrusion spacing. Our findings reveal that ligament formation can be controlled by tuning the roughness and surface wettability. We show that ligament stretching mainly depends on inertia and gravity, whereas the high elasticity prevents the ligament break up, enabling complete rebounds.</description>

      <title>General average balance equations and buoyancy closure for a mixture of a continuous fluid and rigid particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09661v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations of motion of a continuous fluid and rigid, non-Brownian particles that interact through contacts are averaged to derive average balance equations. The averaging procedure is generic, requiring only linearity and commutation with the space and time derivatives. No assumptions about the fluid's rheology and the particles' shapes and compositions are made. We obtain mathematically exact micromechanical expressions for the fluid phase, solid phase, and mixture fields of interest. We demonstrate for a specific example, numerical simulations of sediment transport, based on Direct Numerical Simulations and the Discrete Element Method, that they can be conveniently extracted from such particle-resolved simulations without the need of approximations. In contrast, fields extracted using previous formalisms based on first-order Taylor expansions in the ratio between the particle size and the macroscopic flow scale are in clear disagreement with the exact ones due to a lack of scale separation. This study therefore lays the groundwork for numerically studying the rheology of particulate two-phase flows in systems without scale separation. We also use the simulations to test existing buoyancy closures, that is, decompositions of the fluid-solid interaction force density into a generalized-drag force density and a generalized-buoyancy force density. We find that only one existing closure is consistent with the simulation data and existing experiments. However, it leads to a contradictory fluid momentum balance for certain stationary fluid-particle systems. We resolve this contradiction through a physically-motivated improvement. The improved closure essentially low-pass-filters buoyancy effects of the original closure.</description>

      <title>A deep-water closure model for surface waves on axisymmetric swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the propagation of linear gravity waves on the free surface of steady, axisymmetric flows with purely azimuthal velocity. We propose a two-dimensional set of governing equations for surface waves valid in the deep-water limit. These equations come from a closure condition at the free surface that reduces the three-dimensional Euler equations in the bulk of the fluid to a set of two-dimensional equations applied only at the free surface. Since the closure condition is not obtained rigorously, it is validated numerically through comparisons with full three-dimensional calculations for vortex flows, including for a Lamb-Oseen vortex. The model presented here overcomes three limitations of existing models, namely: it is not restricted to potential base flows; it does not assume the base flow to have a flat free surface; and it does not require the use of infinite-order differential operators (such as $\tanh(\nabla)$) in the governing equations. The model can be applied in the case of rapid swirl (large Froude number) where the base free surface is substantially deformed. Since the model contains only derivatives of finite order, it is readily amenable to standard numerical study.</description>

      <title>Active flow control for drag reduction through multi-agent reinforcement learning on a turbulent cylinder at $Re_D=3900$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents novel drag reduction active-flow-control (AFC) strategies} for a three-dimensional cylinder immersed in a flow at a Reynolds number based on freestream velocity and cylinder diameter of $Re_D=3900$. The cylinder in this subcritical flow regime has been extensively studied in the literature and is considered a classic case of turbulent flow arising from a bluff body. The strategies presented are explored through the use of deep reinforcement learning. The cylinder is equipped with 10 independent zero-net-mass-flux jet pairs, distributed on the top and bottom surfaces, which define the AFC setup. The method is based on the coupling between a computational-fluid-dynamics solver and a multi-agent reinforcement-learning (MARL) framework using the proximal-policy-optimization algorithm. This work introduces a multi-stage training approach to expand the exploration space and enhance drag reduction stabilization. By accelerating training through the exploitation of local invariants with MARL, a drag reduction of approximately 9% is achieved. The cooperative closed-loop strategy developed by the agents is sophisticated, as it utilizes a wide bandwidth of mass-flow-rate frequencies, which classical control methods are unable to match. Notably, the mass cost efficiency is demonstrated to be two orders of magnitude lower than that of classical control methods reported in the literature. These developments represent a significant advancement in active flow control in turbulent regimes, critical for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A Period-Doubling Route to Chaos in Viscoelastic Kolmogorov Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymer solutions can develop chaotic flows, even at low inertia. This purely elastic turbulence is well studied, but little is known about the transition to chaos. In 2D channel flow and parallel shear flow, traveling wave solutions involving coherent structures are present for sufficiently large fluid elasticity. We numerically study 2D periodic parallel shear flow in viscoelastic fluids and show that these traveling waves become oscillatory and undergo a series of period-doubling bifurcations en-route to chaos.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Super-Stencils for Turbulence Model Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of turbulent flows remains a challenge due to the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and the limitations of traditional turbulence models. This paper explores a novel approach to augmenting standard models for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations using a Non-Linear Super-Stencil (NLSS). The proposed method introduces a fully connected neural network that learns a mapping from the local mean flow field to a corrective force term, which is added to a standard RANS solver in order to align its solution with high-fidelity data. A procedure is devised to extract training data from reference DNS and large eddy simulations (LES). To reduce the complexity of the non-linear mapping, the dimensionless local flow data is aligned with the local mean velocity, and the local support domain is scaled by the turbulent integral length scale. After being trained on a single periodic hill case, the NLSS-corrected RANS solver is shown to generalize to different periodic hill geometries and different Reynolds numbers, producing significantly more accurate solutions than the uncorrected RANS simulations.</description>

      <title>Self-similar Features in Sub-secondary Breakup of a Droplet and Ligament Mediated Fragmentation under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet formation is relevant in many applications spanning natural and artificial settings. Comprehending droplet aerobreakup or air-assisted secondary atomization is challenging, especially in high-speed flow scenarios. This entails multi-scale interface deformations with intricate wave dynamics that conform to a non-linear cascade. In the present study, we look into shockwave-induced breakups and associated intermediate processes happening at smaller spatiotemporal scales across the disintegrating droplet interface at different Weber numbers ($We \sim 10^3$). We observe the undulations to follow breakup patterns that resemble a scaled-down version of a secondary atomization event. These sub-secondary breakup processes end with corrugated ligaments that generate the final daughter droplets. The size distribution of these droplets is estimated using a Depth from Defocus (DFD) technique. These illustrate the transient nature of aerobreakup, where the normalized statistics in subsequent time periods and different $We$ are observed to follow a universal distribution. This conforms to a gamma distribution where the associated fit parameters agree well with the coefficients determined from ligament shape factors, corresponding to the limit associated with most extreme corrugations. Scaling laws based on $We$ are deduced for the averaged statistics using a high energy chaotic breakup mechanism. These observations reinforce the idea of a self-similar mechanism for catastrophic aerobreakup of a droplet.</description>

      <title>Vortical waves in a quantum fluid with vector, axial, and helical charges. I. Non-dissipative transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the spin-orbit coupling, Dirac fermions, submerged in a thermal bath with finite macroscopic vorticity, exhibit a spin polarisation along the direction parallel to the vorticity vector $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$. Due to the symmetries of the Lagrangian for free massless Dirac particles, there are three independent and classically conserved currents corresponding to the vector, axial, and helical charges. The constitutive relations for the charge currents and the stress-energy tensor at thermal equilibrium, derived in the framework of quantum field theory at finite temperature, reveal vorticity-induced contributions that deviate from the perfect fluid form. In this paper, we consider the mode structure of the corresponding hydrodynamical theory and derive collective excitations associated with coherent fluctuations of all three charges. We show that the chirally imbalanced rotating fluid should possess non-reciprocal gapless waves that propagate with different velocities along and opposite to the vorticity vector. We also uncover a strictly unidirectional mode, which we call the Axial Vortical Wave, propagating in the background of the axial charge density. The emergence of this wave can be traced back to earlier studies of vortical chiral fluids in a hydrodynamic approach. We also point out an unexpected instability in the limit of degenerate matter and discuss possible solutions when helicity and axial charge non-conservation are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Vortical waves in a quantum fluid with vector, axial and helical charges. II. Dissipative effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the effect of interactions on the local, average polarization of a quantum plasma of massless fermion particles characterized by vector, axial, and helical quantum numbers. Due to the helical and axial vortical effects, perturbations in the vector charge in a rotating plasma can lead to chiral and helical charge transfer along the direction of the vorticity vector. At the same time, interactions between the plasma constituents lead to the dissipation of the helical charge through helicity-violating pair annihilation (HVPA) processes and of the axial charge through the axial anomaly. We will discuss separately a QED-like plasma, in which we ignore background electromagnetic fields and thus the axial charge is approximately conserved, as well as a QCD-like plasma, where instanton effects lead to the violation of the axial charge conservation, even in the absence of background chromomagnetic fields. The non-conservation of helicity and chirality leads to a gapping of the Helical, Axial, and mixed Axial-Helical vortical waves that prevents their infrared modes from propagating. On the other hand, usual dissipative effects, such as charge diffusion, lead to significant damping of ultraviolet modes. We end this paper with a discussion of the regimes where these vortical waves may propagate.</description>
