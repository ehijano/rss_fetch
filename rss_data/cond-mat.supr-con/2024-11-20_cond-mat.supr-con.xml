      <title>Two-dimensional superconductivity and anomalous vortex dissipation in newly-discovered transition metal dichalcogenide-based superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of layered superconductors can vary drastically when thinned down from bulk to monolayer, owing to the reduced dimensionality and weakened interlayer coupling. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the inherent symmetry breaking effect in atomically thin crystals prompts novel states of matter, such as Ising superconductivity with an extraordinary in-plane upper critical field. Here, we demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity resembling those in atomic layers but with more fascinating behaviours can be realized in the bulk crystals of two new TMD-based superconductors Ba0.75ClTaS2 and Ba0.75ClTaSe2. They comprise an alternating stack of H-type TMD layers and Ba-Cl layers. In both materials, intrinsic 2D superconductivity develops below a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The upper critical field along ab plane exceeds the Pauli limit (Hp); in particular, Ba0.75ClTaSe2 exhibits an extremely high in plane Hc2 (14Hp) and a colossal superconducting anisotropy of 150. Moreover, the temperature-field phase diagram of Ba0.75ClTaSe2 under an in-plane magnetic field contains a large phase regime of vortex dissipation, which can be ascribed to the Josephson vortex motion, signifying an unprecedentedly strong fluctuation effect in TMD-based superconductors. Our results provide a new path towards the establishment of 2D superconductivity and novel exotic quantum phases in bulk crystals of TMD-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional superconductivity in new niobium dichalcogenides-based bulk superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit many unexpected properties including two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity as the interlayer coupling being weakened upon either layer-number reduction or chemical intercalation. Here we report the realization of 2D superconductivity in the newly-synthesized niobium dichalcogenides-based bulk superlattices Ba$_{0.75}$ClNbS$_{2}$ and Ba$_{0.75}$ClNbSe$_{2}$, which consists of the alternating stacking of monolayer $H$-NbS$_{2}$ (or $H$-NbSe$_{2}$) and monolayer inorganic insulator spacer Ba$_{0.75}$Cl. Magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements show that both superlattices belong to type-II superconductor with $T_{c}$ of 1 K and 1.25 K, respectively. Intrinsic 2D superconductivity is confirmed for both compounds below a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and a large anisotropy of the upper critical field. Furthermore, the upper critical field along $ab$ plane ($H_{c2}^{\parallel ab}$) exceeds the Pauli limit ($\mu_{0}H_{p}$) in Ba$_{0.75}$ClNbSe$_{2}$, highlighting the influence of spin-orbit interactions. Our results establish a generic method for realizing the 2D superconducting properties in bulk superlattice materials.</description>

      <title>Stripe Antiferromagnetic Ground State of FeSe Revealed by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic ground state of iron selenide (FeSe) has been a topic of debate, with experimental evidence suggesting stripe spin fluctuations as predominant at low temperatures, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) have historically predicted the antiferromagnetic (AFM) dimer configuration. In this study, we utilize the $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ functional, a variant of the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed ($\text{SCAN}$) meta-GGA, to investigate the magnetic configurations of FeSe. Our findings indicate that $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ predicts a stripe-AFM ground state with an anti-parallel spin alignment between layers. The energy difference between the parallel and anti-parallel inter-planar spin alignments is approximately 1.7 meV/atom, predicting a significant but previously unreported interlayer spin coupling not yet observed by experiments. This study underscores the importance of accurate exchange-correlation functionals, such as $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$, in predicting the magnetic ground state in complex materials like FeSe, highlighting its potential to predict magnetic interactions more reliably than traditional GGA functionals by adhering to exact constraints.</description>

      <title>Spin-density wave and superconductivity in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-density wave (SDW) behavior and the potential for superconductivity (SC) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under ambient pressure using a multi-orbital random-phase approximation (RPA). Starting with a twelve-orbital tight-binding model derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the influence of Hubbard interactions on SDW formation. Our analysis reveals a stripe-like SDW characterized by an incommensurate wave vector, $Q\approx(\pm 0.7\pi,0)$, suggesting a possible density wave instability in agreement with recent experiments. This configuration is driven by nesting of outer-layer Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbitals and exhibits interlayer antiferromagnetic ordering between the top and bottom NiO layers, with the middle layer serving as a node. We demonstrate that the Hund's coupling $J_H$ is the primary driver of the observed SDW. While superconductivity is absent in the undoped system under ambient pressure, it becomes attainable with appropriate hole doping ($\delta=-0.4$), resulting in a SC gap structure similar to the high-pressure phase. Our study identifies the specific conditions for realizing the ambient pressure stripe density wave: $J_H&gt;0.16U$. Additionally, when doping leads to sufficient nesting at (0,0), the system's magnetic fluctuations transition into a stable Neel-type antiferromagnetic state, analogous to the high-pressure case.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and Arrangement of Abrikosov Vortices in Hybrid Superconductor-Ferromagnetic Nanostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the nucleation, dynamics, and stationary configurations of Abrikosov vortices in hybrid superconductor-ferromagnetic nanostructures exposed to inhomogeneous magnetic fields generated by a ferromagnetic nanodot. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations and Maxwell's equations, we observe and provide an explanation for the evolution of curved vortex structures that undergo creep-like deformation while reaching a steady state. Spatial variations in the Lorentz force, along with the interaction between geometric constraints and vortex interactions, give rise to unusual stationary vortex configurations that gradually change with increasing field strength, a behavior not seen in homogeneous magnetic fields. These findings reveal complex pinning mechanisms, providing valuable insights for the optimization and further advancement of nanoscale superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>The poor man's Majorana tetron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Majorana tetron is a prototypical topological qubit stemming from the ground state degeneracy of a superconducting island hosting four Majorana modes. This degeneracy manifests as an effective non-local spin degree of freedom, whose most paradigmatic signature is the topological Kondo effect. Degeneracies of states with different fermionic parities characterize also minimal Kitaev chains which have lately emerged as a platform to realize and study unprotected versions of Majorana modes, dubbed poor man's Majorana modes. Here, we introduce the ``poor man's Majorana tetron'', comprising four quantum dots coupled via a floating superconducting island. Its charging energy yields non-trivial correlations among the dots, although, unlike a standard tetron, it is not directly determined by the fermionic parity of the Majorana modes. The poor man's tetron displays parameter regions with a two-fold degenerate ground state with odd fermionic parity, that gives rise to an effective Anderson impurity model when coupled to external leads. We show that this system can approach a regime featuring the topological Kondo effect under a suitable tuning of experimental parameters. Therefore, the poor man's tetron is a promising device to observe the non-locality of Majorana modes and their related fractional conductance.</description>

      <title>Circuit Quantisation from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</description>

      <title>AC losses in macroscopic thin-walled superconducting cylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the ac response represent a valuable method for probing the properties of superconductors. In the surface superconducting state (SSS), a current exceeding the surface critical current $I_\mathrm{c}$ leads to breakdown of SSS and penetration of external magnetic field into the sample bulk. An interesting free-of-bulk system in SSS is offered by thin-walled cylinders. According to the full penetration of magnetic flux (FPMF) model, each time the instant value of an ac field is equal to a certain critical value, the ac susceptibility $\chi$ will exhibit \emph{jumps} as a function of the ac field amplitude $H_\mathrm{ac}$ because of the periodic destruction and restoration of SSS in the cylinder wall. Here we study the low-frequency (128-8192\,Hz) ac response of thin-walled niobium cylinders under superimposed dc and ac magnetic fields applied parallel to the cylinder axis. In contrast to the FPMF model predictions, experiments reveal a \emph{smooth} $\chi(H_\mathrm{ac})$ dependence. To explain the experimental observations, we propose a phenomenological \emph{partial} penetration magnetic flux (PPMF) model, which assumes that after restoration of the superconducting state, the magnetic fields inside and outside the cylinder are unequal and the magnitude of the penetrating flux is random for every penetration. This model fits very well the experimental data on the temperature dependence of the first harmonic $\chi_1$ for any dc field and ac amplitude.</description>

      <title>A Coherent Theory for Superconductivity through Integration of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Theory and Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coherent theory for superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. We propose an integrated theory based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory and density functional theory (DFT), suggesting that superconductivity originates from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for electrons and/or holes, which act as resistance-free superhighways, akin to Cooper pairs in the BCS theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be predicted by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC through DFT. Our integrated theory highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are part of the bulk material and are easily disrupted by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (Tc). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk material, maintaining stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher Tc. This integrated theory is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor, YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic paramagnetic response of topological Majorana surface states in the superconductor $\text{UTe}_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the superconducting gap symmetry and topological signatures in the putative spin-triplet superconductor $\text{UTe}_2$ is an important issue. Especially, a smoking-gun detection scheme for Majorana surface states hallmarking topological superconductivity in $\text{UTe}_2$ is still lacking. In this study, we examine the surface spin susceptibility of $\text{UTe}_2$ with a particular focus on the contribution of the surface states. We find that Majorana surface states contribute significantly to the surface spin susceptibility, and give rise to an Ising-like anisotropy and anomalous enhancement in the surface spin susceptibility. We calculate the surface spin susceptibility as well as the local density of states using the recursive Green's function method and examine the anisotropy of the surface spin susceptibility in terms of the topological surface states and symmetry for all irreducible representations of odd-parity pairing states. Our results indicate that the Ising anisotropy and the anomalous enhancement are attributed to the Majorana surface state protected by the crystalline symmetry. These findings suggest the possibility of detecting the Majorana surface state via magnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>H3Se in the Im-3m Phase: A High-Pressure Superconductor with Tc Reaching 200 K at 64 GPa Mediated by Anharmonic Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based compounds have attracted significant attention in recent years due to the discovery of conventional superconductivity with high critical temperature under high pressure, rekindling hopes for searching room temperature superconductor. In this work, we investigated systematically the vibrational and superconducting properties of H3Se in Im-3m phase under pressures ranging from 50 to 200 GPa. Our approach combines the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation with first-principles calculations to address effects from the quantum and anharmonic vibrations of ions. It turns out that these effects significantly modify the crystal structure, increasing the inner pressure by about 8 GPa compared to situations where they are ignored. The phonon spectra suggest that with these effects included, the crystal can be stabilized at pressures as low as about 61 GPa, much lower than the previously predicted value of over 100 GPa. Our calculations also highlight the critical role of quantum and anharmonic effects on the electron-phonon coupling properties. Neglecting these factors could result in a substantial overestimation of the superconducting critical temperature Tc, by approximately 25 K at 125 GPa, for example. With anharmonic phonons, the Tc derived from the Migdal-Eliashberg equations, reaches 200 K ($\mu^\star$= 0.1, $\lambda$=4.1) as the pressure decreases to 64 GPa, making the crystal a rare high-Tc superconductor at moderate pressures.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a Topological Lattice Model with Strong Repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly tunable nature of synthetic quantum materials -- both in the solid-state and cold atom contexts -- invites examining which microscopic ingredients aid in the realization of correlated phases of matter such as superconductors. Recent experimental advances in moir\'e materials suggest that unifying the features of the Fermi-Hubbard model and quantum Hall systems creates a fertile ground for the emergence of such phases. Here, we introduce a minimal 2D lattice model that incorporates exactly these features: time-reversal symmetry, band topology, and strong repulsive interactions. By using infinite cylinder density matrix renormalization group methods (cylinder iDMRG), we investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model. We find that it hosts an interaction-induced quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator and demonstrate that weakly hole-doping this state gives rise to a superconductor at a finite circumference, with indications that this behavior persists on larger cylinders. At the aforementioned circumference, the superconducting phase is surprisingly robust to perturbations including additional repulsive interactions in the pairing channel. By developing a technique to probe the superconducting gap function in iDMRG, we phenomenologically characterize the superconductor. Namely, we demonstrate that it is formed from the weak pairing of holes atop the QSH insulator. Furthermore, we determine the pairing symmetry of the superconductor, finding it to be $p$-wave -- reminiscent of the unconventional superconductivity reported in experiments on twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Motivated by this, we elucidate structural similarities and differences between our model and those of TBG in its chiral limit. Finally, to provide a more direct experimental realization, we detail an implementation of our Hamiltonian in a system of cold fermionic alkaline-earth atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <title>Increasing superconducting $T_c$ by layering in the attractive Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The attractive Hubbard model has become a model readily realizable with ultracold atoms on optical lattices. However, the superconducting (superfluid) critical temperatures, $T_c$'s, are still somewhat smaller than the lowest temperatures achieved in experiments. Here we consider two possible routes, generically called layering, to increase $T_c$: a bilayer and a simple cubic lattice, both with tunable hopping, $t_z$, between attractive Hubbard planes. We have performed minus-sign--free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to calculate response functions such as pairing correlation functions, uniform spin susceptibility, and double occupancy, through which we map out some physical properties. We have found that by a judicious choice of fillings and intensity of on-site attraction, a bilayer can exhibit $T_c$'s between 1.5 and 1.7 times those of the single layer; for the simple-cubic lattice the enhancement can be 30\% larger than the maximum for the single layer. We also check the accuracy of both a BCS-like estimate for $T_c$ in the attractive Hubbard model, as well as of an upper bound for $T_c$ based on the superfluid density.</description>

      <title>Low-characteristic-impedance superconducting tadpole resonators in the sub-gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02558</link>

Abstract: We demonstrate a simple and versatile resonator design based on a short strip of a typical coplanar waveguide shorted at one end to the ground and shunted at the other end with a large parallel-plate capacitor. Due to the shape of the structure, we coin it the tadpole resonator. The design allows tailoring the characteristic impedance of the resonator to especially suit applications requiring low values. We demonstrate characteristic impedances ranging from $Z_c = 2\,{\Omega}$ to $10\,{\Omega}$ and a frequency range from $f_0 = 290\,\mathrm{MHz}$ to $1.1\,\mathrm{GHz}$ while reaching internal quality factors of order $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.5\times 10^3$ translating into a loss tangent of $\tan({\delta}) = 1.2\times 10^{-4}$ for the aluminium oxide used as the dielectric in the parallel plate capacitor. We conclude that these tadpole resonators are well suited for applications requiring low frequency and low charactersitic impedance while maintaining a small footprint on chip. The low characteristic impedance of the tadpole resonator renders it a promising candidate for achieving strong inductive coupling to other microwave components.</description>

      <title>Topological vortices in planar S-TI-S Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, where the TI section is narrow and long. We are motivated by recent experiments, especially by those in junctions of Corbino ring geometry, where non-zero critical current was observed at low temperatures even if a non-zero phase winding number (fluxoid) was enforced in the ring by the perpendicular magnetic field. In this paper we focus on the "atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit we can associate the non-vanishing critical current with the irregularities (disorder) in the junction's width. We also discuss the microwave spectroscopy of the Josephson vortices in the atomic limit and observe particularly simple selection rules for the allowed transitions.</description>
