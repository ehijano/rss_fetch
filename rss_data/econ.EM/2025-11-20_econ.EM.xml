      <title>Causal Inference in Financial Event Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial event studies, ubiquitous in finance research, typically use linear factor models with known factors to estimate abnormal returns and identify causal effects of information events. This paper demonstrates that when factor models are misspecified -- an almost certain reality -- traditional event study estimators produce inconsistent estimates of treatment effects. The bias is particularly severe during volatile periods, over long horizons, and when event timing correlates with market conditions. We derive precise conditions for identification and expressions for asymptotic bias. As an alternative, we propose synthetic control methods that construct replicating portfolios from control securities without imposing specific factor structures. Revisiting four empirical applications, we show that some established findings may reflect model misspecification rather than true treatment effects. While traditional methods remain reliable for short-horizon studies with random event timing, our results suggest caution when interpreting long-horizon or volatile-period event studies and highlight the importance of quasi-experimental designs when available.</description>

      <title>Tractable Estimation of Nonlinear Panels with Interactive Fixed Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive fixed effects are routinely controlled for in linear panel models. While an analogous fixed effects (FE) estimator for nonlinear models has been available in the literature (Chen, Fernandez-Val and Weidner, 2021), it sees much more limited use in applied research because its implementation involves solving a high-dimensional non-convex problem. In this paper, we complement the theoretical analysis of Chen, Fernandez-Val and Weidner (2021) by providing a new computationally efficient estimator that is asymptotically equivalent to their estimator. Unlike the previously proposed FE estimator, our estimator avoids solving a high-dimensional optimization problem and can be feasibly computed in large nonlinear panels. Our proposed method involves two steps. In the first step, we convexify the optimization problem using nuclear norm regularization (NNR) and obtain preliminary NNR estimators of the parameters, including the fixed effects. Then, we find the global solution of the original optimization problem using a standard gradient descent method initialized at these preliminary estimates. Thus, in practice, one can simply combine our computationally efficient estimator with the inferential theory provided in Chen, Fernandez-Val and Weidner (2021) to construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Estimation of Fractional Integration: An Evaluation of Local Whittle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractionally integrated time series exhibiting long memory are commonly found in economics, finance, and related fields. Semiparametric methods for estimating the memory parameter $d$ have proven to be effective and robust, but practitioners face difficulties arising from the availability of multiple estimators with different valid parameter ranges and the choice of bandwidth parameter $m$. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of local Whittle methods from Robinson's (1995) foundational estimator through the exact local Whittle approaches of Shimotsu and Phillips (2005) and Shimotsu (2010), where theoretical advances have expanded the feasible range of memory parameters and improved efficiency. Using a new implementation in Python, PyELW, we replicate key empirical and Monte Carlo results from the literature, providing external validation for both the original findings and the software implementation. We extend these empirical applications to demonstrate how method choice can affect substantive conclusions about persistence. Based on comprehensive simulation comparisons and empirical evidence, we provide practical guidance for applied researchers on how and when to use each method.</description>

      <title>Regression adjustment in completely randomized experiments with many covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00469v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates estimation and inference for average treatment effects in completely randomized experiments when researchers observe potentially many covariates. Within Neyman's (1923) design-based framework, allowing the number of covariates to grow more slowly than the sample size, we demonstrate that a cross-fitted regression adjustment estimator--adapted from Aronow and Middleton (2013)--exhibits more favorable asymptotic properties than existing alternatives, such as Lin's (2013) regression adjustment estimator and the bias-corrected estimator of Lei and Ding (2021). For inference, we derive the first- and second-order terms in the stochastic expansions of regression-adjusted estimators, analyze the higher-order behavior of existing inference procedures, and introduce a modified version of the HC3 standard error. The proposed methods extend naturally to stratified experiments with large strata. Simulation studies show that the cross-fitted estimator, in combination with the modified HC3, provides accurate point estimates and reliable size control across a wide range of data-generating processes.</description>

      <title>Testing Conditional Stochastic Dominance at Target Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel test for conditional stochastic dominance (CSD) at specific values of the conditioning covariates, referred to as target points. The test is relevant for analyzing income inequality, evaluating treatment effects, and studying discrimination. We propose a Kolmogorov--Smirnov-type test statistic that utilizes induced order statistics from independent samples. Notably, the test features a data-independent critical value, eliminating the need for resampling techniques such as the bootstrap. Our approach avoids kernel smoothing and parametric assumptions, instead relying on a tuning parameter to select relevant observations. We establish the asymptotic properties of our test, showing that the induced order statistics converge to independent draws from the true conditional distributions and that the test is asymptotically of level $\alpha$ under weak regularity conditions. While our results apply to both continuous and discrete data, in the discrete case, the critical value only provides a valid upper bound. To address this, we propose a refined critical value that significantly enhances power, requiring only knowledge of the support size of the distributions. Additionally, we analyze the test's behavior in the limit experiment, demonstrating that it reduces to a problem analogous to testing unconditional stochastic dominance in finite samples. This framework allows us to prove the validity of permutation-based tests for stochastic dominance when the random variables are continuous. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the strong finite-sample performance of our method.</description>
