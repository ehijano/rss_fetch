      <title>A framework for discrete optimization of stellarator coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing magnets for three-dimensional plasma confinement is a key task for advancing the stellarator as a fusion reactor concept. Stellarator magnets must produce an accurate field while leaving adequate room for other components and being reasonably simple to construct and assemble. In this paper, a framework for coil design and optimization is introduced that enables the attainment of sparse magnet solutions with arbitrary restrictions on where coils may be located. The solution space is formulated as a "wireframe" consisting of a mesh of interconnected wire segments enclosing the plasma. Two methods are developed for optimizing the current distribution on a wireframe: Regularized Constrained Least Squares (RCLS), which uses a linear least-squares approach to optimize the currents in each segment, and Greedy Stellarator Coil Optimization (GSCO), a fully discrete procedure in which loops of current are added to the mesh one by one to achieve the desired magnetic field on the plasma boundary. Examples will be presented of solutions obtainable with each method, some of which are able to achieve high field accuracy while obeying spatial constraints that permit easy assembly.</description>

      <title>On the transfer of the angular momentum of a structured laser pulse to an ensemble of charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A structure of a laser pulse may significantly influence the dynamics of interacting particles. In the case of dilute plasma the particle dynamics may be considered in the single particle approximation. In this paper the problem of the angular momentum gain of a single particle in a focused structured pulse is considered for some certain cases, including radial and azimuthal polarizations, in the frameworks of the theoretical model, presented in [E. Dmitriev and Ph. Korneev, 'Angular momentum gain by electrons under the action of intense structured light', Physical Review A, vol. 110, p. 013514, (2024)], which includes solving of Maxwell's equations with a required accuracy and the high order perturbation theory. The obtained analytical results are compared to the results of numerical simulations. Angular dependence in the structure of the laser pulse is shown to be critically important for the orbital angular momentum gain of an ensemble of charged particles in a structured wave.</description>

      <title>Conversion of intense laser pulses into electromagnetic fields with use of extended targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects leading to generation of quasi-stationary and propagating electromagnetic fields during the propagation of a laser-driven current discharge pulse in extended targets are considered. The results of numerical modeling describe the interaction of a relativistically intense ultrashort laser pulse with an extended dense target and its transformation into a powerful discharge current pulse. It is shown that under certain conditions such a pulse can be used to generate strong electromagnetic fields with certain spatio-temporal properties. Particular attention is paid to the influence of the discharge pulse parameters on the properties of the induced electromagnetic fields. Analysis of the discharge current profile in dependence on the target thickness is provided and the dynamics of discharge current pulse profile evolution is studied on the time scale $\sim 10$ ps, when the propagation distance is $\sim 3$ mm.</description>

      <title>Multi-Electrode Dielectric Barrier Discharge Actuators: Geometrical Optimization of High Power Density Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator arrays have been suggested as active flow control devices due to the robust electrohydrodynamic (EHD) force generation in variable atmospheric conditions. DBD plasma augmentation schemes allow for significant performance improvements. However, the transitions to sliding discharge or counter-flow discharge limit their use in high-power arrays. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the performance of a scalable DBD array for two alternating phases of air-exposed electrode configuration. Plasma emissions, direct thrust, velocity profiles, and power consumption measurements of the DBD array reveal that cross-talk between DBD stages can be eliminated to create high-power density actuators. AC augmentation of plasma provides additional gains in thrust; however, the transition to sliding and filamentary discharge reveals geometric limits when increasing the array power density. Introducing a segmented electrode with a resistor delays the onset of adverse sliding and filamentary discharge, allowing it to operate at higher voltage inputs. An optimized four-stage DBD array generated thrust &gt; 250 mN/m with a wall jet thickness &gt; 15 mm, enabling a broader range of flow control applications.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Utilization as a Plasma Source for Magnetohydrodynamic Direct Power Extraction (MHD-DPE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the suitability of hydrogen-based plasma in direct power extraction (DPE) as a non-conventional electricity generation method. We apply computational modeling and principles in physics and chemistry to estimate different thermal and electric properties of a water-vapor/nitrogen/cesium-vapor (H2O/N2/Cs) gas mixture with different levels of cesium (Cs) at a fixed temperature of 2300 K (2026.85 {\deg}C). This gas mixture and temperature are selected because they resemble the stoichiometric combustion of hydrogen with air, followed by the addition of the alkali metal element cesium to allow ionization, thus converting the gas mixture into electrically conducting plasma. We vary the cesium mole fraction in the gas mixture by two orders of magnitude, from a minute amount of 0.0625% (1/1600) to a major amount of 16% (0.16). We use these results to further estimate the theoretical upper limit of the electric power output from a unit volume of a high-speed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel, with the plasma accelerated inside it to twice the local speed of sound (Mach number 2) while subject to an applied magnetic field of 5 T (5 teslas). We report that there is an optimum cesium mole fraction of 3%, at which the power output is maximized. Per 1 m3 of plasma volume, the estimated theoretical electric power generation at 1 atm (101.325 kPa) pressure of the hydrogen-combustion mixture is extraordinarily high at 360 MW/m3, and the plasma electric conductivity is 17.5 S/m. This estimated power generation even reaches an impressive level of 1.15 GW/m3 (11500 MW/m3) if the absolute pressure can be decreased to 0.0625 atm (6.333 kPa), at which the electric conductivity exceeds 55 S/m (more than 10 times the electric conductivity of seawater).</description>

      <title>Multimodal azimuthal oscillations in electron beam generated $\textbf{E} \times \textbf{B}$ plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron beam (e-beam) generated plasmas with applied cross electric and magnetic $\left( \textbf{E} \times \textbf{B} \right)$ fields are promising for low-damage material processing. However, these plasmas can be subject to the formation of azimuthally propagating structures that enhance the radial transport of energetic charged species, which can harm the gentle processing capability of the plasma. In this work we investigate the azimuthal structure formation in an e-beam generated $\textbf{E} \times \textbf{B}$ plasma using experimental diagnostics and 2D3V particle-in-cell simulations. Our findings demonstrate the formation of multiple simultaneously occurring azimuthally propagating modes that exhibit a nontrivial radial dependence. It is suggested that the multimodal azimuthal spectrum is caused by the complex nature of the ion dynamics in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Spectrally accurate reverse-mode differentiable bounce-averaging operator and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectrally accurate bounce-averaging operator implemented as a part of the automatically differentiable DESC stellarator optimization suite. Using this operator, we calculate the proxy for neoclassical transport coefficient $\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}^{3/2}$ in the $1/\nu$ regime and benchmark it against the NEO code. Ultimately, by employing this differentiable approximation, for the first time, we directly optimize a finite-$\beta$ stellarator to enhance neoclassical transport using reverse-mode differentiation. This ensures that the computational cost of determining the gradients does not depend on the number of input parameters.</description>

      <title>Maximum Energy of Particles in Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles are accelerated to very high, non-thermal energies in space, solar, and astrophysical plasma environments. In cosmic ray physics, the "Hillas limit" is often used as a rough estimate (or the necessary condition) of the maximum energy of particles. This limit is based on the concepts of one-shot direct acceleration by a system-wide motional electric field, as well as stochastic and diffusive acceleration in strongly turbulent environments. However, it remains unclear how well this limit explains the actual observed maximum energies of particles. Here we show, based on a systematic review, that the observed maximum energy of particles -- those in space, solar, astrophysical, and laboratory environments -- often reach the energy predicted by the Hillas limit. We also found several exceptions, such as electrons in solar flares and jet-terminal lobes of radio galaxies, as well as protons in planetary radiation belts, where deviations from this limit occur. We discuss possible causes of such deviations, and we argue in particular that there is a good chance of detecting ultra-high-energy ($\sim$100 GeV) solar flare electrons that have not yet been detected. We anticipate that this study will facilitate further interdisciplinary discussions on the maximum energy of particles and the underlying mechanisms of particle acceleration in diverse plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-polaritons on a single electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explicit expression for the photon polarization operator in the presence of a single electron is found in the $in$-$in$ formalism in the one-loop approximation out of the photon mass-shell. This polarization operator describes the dielectric permittivity of a single electron wave packet in coherent scattering processes. The plasmons and plasmon-polaritons supported by a single electron wave packet are described. The two limiting cases are considered: the wavelength of the external electromagnetic field is much smaller than the typical scale of variations of the electron wave packet and the wavelength of the external electromagnetic field is much larger than the size of the electron wave packet. In the former case, there are eight independent plasmon-polariton modes. In the latter case, the plasmons boil down to the dynamical dipole moment attached to a point electron. Thus, in the infrared limit, the electron possesses a dynamical electric dipole moment manifesting itself in coherent scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Marginal Role of the Electrostatic Instability in the GeV-scale Cascade Flux from 1ES 0229+200</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic pair beams produced in the intergalactic medium (IGM) by TeV gamma rays from blazars are expected to generate a detectable GeV-scale electromagnetic cascade, yet this cascade is absent in the observed spectra of hard-spectrum TeV emitting blazars. This suppression is often attributed to weak intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) deflecting electron-positron pairs out of the line of sight. Alternatively, it has been proposed that beam-plasma instabilities could drain the energy of the beam before they produce the secondary cascades. Recent studies suggest that the modification of beam distribution due to these instabilities is primarily driven by particle scattering, rather than energy loss. In this paper, we quantitatively assess, for the blazar 1ES 0229+200, the arrival time of secondary gamma rays at Earth from the beam scattering by the electrostatic instability. We first computed the production rates of electron-positron pairs at various distances using the Monte Carlo simulation CRPropa. We then simulated the feedback of the plasma instability on the beam, incorporating production rates and inverse-Compton cooling, to determine the steady-state distribution function. Our findings reveal that the time delay of the GeV secondary cascade arrival due to instability broadening is on the order of a few months. This delay is insufficient to account for the missing cascade emission in blazar spectra, suggesting that plasma instabilities do not significantly affect IGMF constraints.</description>

      <title>Forced 3D reconnection in an exponentially separating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solvable scenario for 3D reconnection in a sheared magnetic field. We consider a localized external force that is applied slowly and then maintained, generating an Alfv\'{e}nic perturbation that spreads along the field lines. Separation of the sheared field lines causes the scale of the perturbation across the field to decrease, enabling magnetic diffusion to be enhanced. For a fusion-motivated equilibrium with exponential field-line separation, we find a reconnection timescale proportional to $S/\ln S$ under magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and to $S^{1/3}$ for semi-collisional electron-only reconnection, where $S$ is the Lundquist number of the perturbed flux tube. We generalize these results to arbitrary magnetic geometries, showing that the latter is geometry-independent. Interestingly, we find that slower field-line separation yields an increased reconnection rate in MHD.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the collisionless tearing mode by flow shear: implications for reconnection onset in the Alfv\'enic solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the collisionless tearing mode instability of a current sheet with a strong shear flow across the layer. The growth rate decreases with increasing shear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\'enic. We also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growth rate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio, the opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find that even a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scaling behaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shear flow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across the electron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnection events in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's Parker Solar Probe.</description>

Abstract: A four-field reduced model of single helicity, incompressible MHD is derived in cylindrical geometry. An appropriate set of noncanonical variables is found, and the Hamiltonian, the Lie-Poisson bracket and the Casimir invariants are clarified. Detailed proofs of properties of the Lie-Poisson bracket, (i) antisymmetry, (ii) Leibniz rule, and (iii) Jacobi identity, are given. Two applications are presented: the first is that the local dispersion relation of axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics (MRI) is properly reproduced, and the second is that linear stability analyses including negative-energy MRI were successfully performed.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>
