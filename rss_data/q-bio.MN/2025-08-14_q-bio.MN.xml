      <title>Stability of randomly switching stochastic reaction networks with asymptotically linear transition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09421</link>

Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks are mathematical models frequently used in, but not limited to, biochemistry. These models are continuous-time Markov chains whose transition rates depend on certain parameters called rate constants, which despite the name may not be constant in real-world applications. In this paper we study how random switching between different stochastic reaction networks with asymptotically linear rate functions affects the stability of the process. We give matrix conditions for both positive recurrence (indeed, exponentially ergodicity) and transience (indeed, evanescence) in both the regime with high switching rates and the regime with low switching rates. We then make use of these conditions to provide examples of processes whose stability behavior changes as the switching rate varies. We also explore what happens in the middle regime where the switching rates are neither high nor low and our theorems do not apply. Specifically, we show by examples that there can be arbitrarily many phase transitions between exponentially ergodicity and evanescence as the switching rate increases.</description>

      <title>Reaction cleaving and complex-balanced distributions for chemical reaction networks with general kinetics</title>

Abstract: Reaction networks have become a major modelling framework in the biological sciences from epidemiology and population biology to genetics and cellular biology. In recent years, much progress has been made on stochastic reaction networks (SRNs), modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) and their stationary distributions. We are interested in complex-balanced stationary distributions, where the probability flow out of a complex equals the flow into the complex. We characterise the existence and the form of complex-balanced distributions of SRNs with arbitrary transition functions through conditions on the cycles of the reaction graph (a digraph). Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of a complex-balanced distribution and give precise conditions for when it is also necessary. The sufficient condition is also necessary for mass-action kinetics (and certain generalisations of that) or if the connected components of the digraph are cycles. Moreover, we state a deficiency theorem, a generalisation of the deficiency theorem for stochastic mass-action kinetics to arbitrary stochastic kinetics. The theorem gives the co-dimension of the parameter space for which a complex-balanced distribution exists. To achieve this, we construct an iterative procedure to decompose a strongly connected reaction graph into disjoint cycles, such that the corresponding SRN has equivalent dynamics and preserves complex-balancedness, provided the original SRN had so. This decomposition might have independent interest and might be applicable to edge-labelled digraphs in general.</description>

      <title>Unlasting: Unpaired Single-Cell Multi-Perturbation Estimation by Dual Conditional Diffusion Implicit Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way, and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent heterogeneity in single-cell responses.</description>
