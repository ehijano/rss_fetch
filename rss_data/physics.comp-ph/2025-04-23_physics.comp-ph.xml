      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods find growing application in the reconstruction and analysis of data in high energy physics experiments. A modified convolutional autoencoder model was employed to identify and reconstruct the pulses from scintillating crystals. The model was further investigated using four xAI methods for deeper understanding of the underlying reconstruction mechanism. The results are discussed in detail, underlining the importance of xAI for knowledge gain and further improvement of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>High-performance training and inference for deep equivariant interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials, particularly those based on deep equivariant neural networks, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy and computational efficiency in atomistic modeling tasks like molecular dynamics and high-throughput screening. The size of datasets and demands of downstream workflows are growing rapidly, making robust and scalable software essential. This work presents a major overhaul of the NequIP framework focusing on multi-node parallelism, computational performance, and extensibility. The redesigned framework supports distributed training on large datasets and removes barriers preventing full utilization of the PyTorch 2.0 compiler at train time. We demonstrate this acceleration in a case study by training Allegro models on the SPICE 2 dataset of organic molecular systems. For inference, we introduce the first end-to-end infrastructure that uses the PyTorch Ahead-of-Time Inductor compiler for machine learning interatomic potentials. Additionally, we implement a custom kernel for the Allegro model's most expensive operation, the tensor product. Together, these advancements speed up molecular dynamics calculations on system sizes of practical relevance by up to a factor of 18.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07344v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>The case of the missing gallium vacancy in gallium arsenide: A multiscale explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irradiation of gallium arsenide (GaAs) produces immobile vacancies and mobile interstitials. However, after decades of experimental investigation, the immobile Ga vacancy eludes observation, raising the question: Where is the Ga vacancy? Static first-principles calculations predict a Ga vacancy should be readily observed. We find that short-time dynamical evolution of primary defects is key to explaining this conundrum. Introducing a multiscale Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) method, we discover that during the initial displacement damage, the Fermi level shifts to mid-gap producing oppositely charged vacancies and interstitials. Driven by Coulomb attraction, fast As interstitials preferentially annihilate Ga vacancies, causing their population to plummet below detectable limits before being experimentally observed. This innovative model solves the mystery of the missing Ga vacancy and reveals the importance of a multiscale approach to explore the dynamical chemical behavior in experimentally inaccessible short-time regimes.</description>

      <title>Vielbein Lattice Boltzmann approach for fluid flows on spherical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann scheme based on the vielbein formalism for the study of fluid flows on spherical surfaces. The vielbein vector field encodes all details related to the geometry of the underlying spherical surface, allowing the velocity space to be treated as on the Cartesian space. The resulting Boltzmann equation exhibits inertial (geometric) forces, that ensure that fluid particles follow paths that remain on the spherical manifold, which we compute by projection onto the space of Hermite polynomials.
  Due to the point-dependent nature of the advection velocity in the polar coordinate $\theta$, exact streaming is not feasible, and we instead employ finite-difference schemes. We provide a detailed formulation of the lattice Boltzmann algorithm, with particular attention to boundary conditions at the north and south poles.
  We validate our numerical implementation against two analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations derived in this work: the propagation of sound and shear waves. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the scheme by simulating the compressible flow of an axisymmetric shockwave and analyzing vortex dynamics on the spherical surface.</description>

      <title>Quantum Discrete Variable Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for implementing the Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) transformation, a technique widely used in simulations of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians. DVR provides a diagonal representation of local operators and enables sparse Hamiltonian structures, making it a powerful alternative to the finite basis representation (FBR), particularly in high-dimensional problems. While DVR has been extensively used in classical simulations, its quantum implementation, particularly using Gaussian quadrature grids, remains underexplored. We develop a quantum circuit that efficiently transforms FBR into DVR by following a recursive construction based on quantum arithmetic operations, and we compare this approach with methods that directly load DVR matrix elements using quantum read-only memory (QROM). We analyze the quantum resources, including T-gate and qubit counts, required for implementing the DVR unitary and discuss preferable choices of QROM-based and recursive-based methods for a given matrix size and precision. This study lays the groundwork for utilizing DVR Hamiltonians in quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation with block encoding.</description>

      <title>Real-fluid behavior in rapid compression machines: Does it matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid compression machines (RCMs) have been extensively used to quantify fuel autoignition chemistry and validate chemical kinetic models. Historically, the analyses of experimental and modeling RCM autoignition data have been conducted based on the adiabatic core hypothesis where real-fluid behavior has been completely overlooked, though this might be significant at common RCM test conditions. This work presents a first-of-its-kind study that addresses two significant questions for autoignition studies within RCMs in the fundamental combustion community: (i) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect interpretation and analysis of RCM experimental data? and (ii) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect RCM autoignition modeling and the validation of chemical kinetic models? To this end, theories for real-fluid isentropic change are newly proposed and derived based on high-order Virial EoS, and are further incorporated into an effective-volume real-fluid autoignition modeling framework newly developed for RCMs. With detailed analyses, the strong real-fluid behavior in common RCM tests is confirmed, which can greatly influence the interpretation of RCM autoignition experiments, particularly the determination of end-of-compression temperature and evolution of the adiabatic core in the reaction chamber. Furthermore, real-fluid RCM modeling results reveal that considerable error can be introduced into simulating RCM autoignition experiments when assuming ideal-gas behavior, leading to contradictory validation results of chemical kinetic models. Therefore, we recommend the community adopt frameworks with real-fluid behavior fully accounted for to analyze and simulate past and future RCM experiments, so as to avoid misinterpretation of RCM autoignition experiments and eliminate the errors that can be introduced into the simulation results with the existing RCM modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>High order treatment of moving curved boundaries: Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian methods with a shifted boundary polynomials correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach for the prescription of high order boundary conditions when approximating the solution of the Euler equations for compressible gas dynamics on curved moving domains. When dealing with curved boundaries, the consistency of boundary conditions is a real challenge, and it becomes even more challenging in the context of moving domains discretized with high order Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) schemes. The ALE formulation is particularly well-suited for handling moving and deforming domains, thus allowing for the simulation of complex fluid-structure interaction problems. However, if not properly treated, the imposition of boundary conditions can lead to significant errors in the numerical solution, which can spoil the high order discretization of the underlying mathematical model. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a new method based on the recently developed shifted boundary polynomial correction, which was originally proposed on fixed meshes. The new method is integrated into the space-time corrector step of a direct ALE finite volume method to account for the local curvature of the moving boundary by only exploiting the high order reconstruction polynomial of the finite volume control volume. It relies on a correction based on the extrapolated value of the cell polynomial evaluated at the true geometry, thus not requiring the explicit evaluation of high order Taylor series. This greatly simplifies the treatment of moving curved boundaries, as it allows for the use of standard simplicial meshes, which are much easier to generate and move than curvilinear ones, especially for 3D time-dependent problems. Several numerical experiments are presented demonstrating the high order convergence properties of the new method in the context of compressible flows in moving curved domains, which remain approximated by piecewise linear elements.</description>

      <title>Upscaling the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard model for incompressible multiphase flow in inhomogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a macroscopic model for the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids in inhomogeneous porous medium. At the pore scale, the flow is governed by the fully Navier-Stokes equations while the evolution of the phase interface is captured by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Using the volume averaging method, the upscaled equations describing the averaged behavior of two fluids at the Darcy scale are obtained, with unclosed terms related to spatial deviations. Then, spatial derivations are carefully modeled up to some undetermined coefficients, which could be evaluated by solving simplified closure problems in each representative volume element. In particular, the wetting behavior is incorporated into the averaged chemical potential. The differences between the proposed equations and the empirical two-phase Darcy-type models are discussed. Finally, a phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann model for the averaged equations is presented, and numerical results demonstrate the abilities of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>clusttraj: A Solvent-Informed Clustering Tool for Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering techniques are consolidated as a powerful strategy for analyzing the extensive data generated from molecular modeling. In particular, some tools have been developed to cluster configurations from classical simulations with a standard focus on individual units, ranging from small molecules to complex proteins. Since the standard approach includes computing the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, accounting for the permutation between atoms is crucial for optimizing the clustering procedure in the presence of identical molecules. To address this issue, we present the clusttraj program, a solvent-informed clustering package that fixes inflated RMSD values by finding the optimal pairing between configurations. The program combines reordering schemes with the Kabsch algorithm to minimize the RMSD of molecular configurations before running a hierarchical clustering protocol. By considering evaluation metrics, one can determine the ideal threshold in an automated fashion and compare the different linkage schemes available. The program capabilities are exemplified by considering solute-solvent systems ranging from pure water clusters to a solvated protein or a small solute in different solvents. As a result, we investigate the dependence on different parameters, such as the system size and reordering method, and also the representativeness of the cluster medoids for the characterization of optical properties. clusttraj is implemented as a Python library and can be employed to cluster generic ensembles of molecular configurations that go beyond solute-solvent systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose symbolic regression as a powerful tool for studying Beyond the Standard Model physics. As a benchmark model, we consider the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which has a four-dimensional parameter space defined at the GUT scale. We provide a set of analytical expressions that reproduce three low-energy observables of interest in terms of the parameters of the theory: the Higgs mass, the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the cold dark matter relic density. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we employ the symbolic expressions in a global fits analysis to derive the posterior probability densities of the parameters, which are obtained extremely rapidly in comparison with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network architecture for efficient sampling of statistical physics models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of sampling efficiently the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution of disordered systems is important both for the theoretical understanding of these models and for the solution of practical optimization problems. Unfortunately, this task is known to be hard, especially for spin glasses at low temperatures. Recently, many attempts have been made to tackle the problem by mixing classical Monte Carlo schemes with newly devised Neural Networks that learn to propose smart moves. In this article we introduce the Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network (4N) architecture, a physically-interpretable deep architecture whose number of parameters scales linearly with the size of the system and that can be applied to a large variety of topologies. We show that the 4N architecture can accurately learn the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model, and specifically for some of its most difficult instances. In particular, it captures properties such as the energy, the correlation function and the overlap probability distribution. Finally, we show that the 4N performance increases with the number of layers, in a way that clearly connects to the correlation length of the system, thus providing a simple and interpretable criterion to choose the optimal depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example,financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning and a method of detection by dynamic systems and statistical analysis of the distribution of data. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Competing Effects of Dynamic Solvation Structures on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts of Battery Electrolytes via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</description>

Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</description>
