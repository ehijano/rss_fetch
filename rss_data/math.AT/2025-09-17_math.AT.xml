      <title>A new approach to (3+1)-dimensional TQFTs via topological modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a construction toward a new type of TQFTs at the crossroads of low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, physics, and homotopy theory. It assigns TMF-modules to closed 3-manifolds and maps of TMF-modules to 4-dimensional cobordisms. This is a mathematical proposal for one of the simplest examples in a family of ${\pi}_*({\rm TMF})$-valued invariants of 4-manifolds which are expected to arise from 6-dimensional superconformal field theories. As part of the construction, we define TMF-modules associated with symmetric bilinear forms, using (spectral) derived algebraic geometry. The invariant of unimodular bilinear forms takes values in ${\pi}_*({\rm TMF})$, conjecturally generalizing the theta function of a lattice. We discuss gluing properties of the invariants. We also demonstrate some interesting physics applications of the TMF-modules such as distinguishing phases of quantum field theories in various dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Insertion Chain Complex: A Topological Approach to the Structure of Word Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Insertion Chain Complex, a higher-dimensional extension of insertion graphs, as a new framework for analyzing finite sets of words. We study its topological and combinatorial properties, in particular its homology groups, as measures of the complexity for word sets. After establishing its theoretical foundations, we investigate the computational and combinatorial aspects of these complexes. Among other results, we classify minimal 1-dimensional cycles and prove that every finitely generated abelian group can be realized as the homology of the insertion complex for some set of words. We also identify conditions that guarantee vanishing homology. These results provide new invariants for characterizing finite sets of words through word-based topological structures and their properties.</description>

      <title>On the group cohomology of groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/m$ with $m$ square-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an explicit computation of the cohomology groups (with untwisted coefficients) of semidirect products of the form $\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/m$ with $m$ free of squares, by means of formulas that only depend on $n$, $m$ and the action of $\mathbb{Z}/m$ on $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We want to highlight the fact that we are not impossing any conditions on the $\mathbb{Z}/m$-action on $\mathbb{Z}^n$, and as far as we know our formulas are the first in the literature in this generality. This generalizes previous computations of L\"uck-Davis and Adem-Ge-Pan-Petrosyan. In order to show that our formulas are usable, we develop a concrete example of the form $\mathbb{Z}^5\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/6$ where its cohomology groups are described in full detail.</description>

      <title>A Stable Measure for Conditional Periodicity of Time Series using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, but we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results. Persistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity similarity of two univariate time series, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. We prove stability of score(f1|f2) under orthogonal projection of the time series embeddings onto their first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. We derive a lower bound on the embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings produce scores that are linearly within epsilon of each other. We present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several types of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of percent determinism (%DET) and show greater stability of score(f1|f2). We also compare both measures on several pairs of real time series describing monthly proportions of incoming calls to a police agency and highlight the decreased stability of %DET on the same.</description>

      <title>The Negation Of Singer's Conjecture For The Sixth Algebraic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09455v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6,6+36).$</description>

      <title>Punctured tubular neighborhoods and stable homotopy at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this revised version (August 2025), we add a survey of \infty-categorical (co)limits and a replacement lemma for higher functoriality (Lem. 1.4.5), a framework for explicit models of punctured tubular neighborhoods ({\S}3.4), and a new theory of orientation classes for line bundles and Thom spaces of virtual bundles over singular curves ({\S}5.1, 5.2). Building on this, we make explicit the normalization of the resulting isomorphisms, reformulate our main theorem (Th. 5.3.3) to incorporate orientation classes, and show how these choices yield quadratic Mumford matrices computed via Smith form over the Grothendieck-Witt ring of the base field. The appendices are expanded to give a better account of the notion of orientation classes, and to describe trace computations on Chow-Witt groups over possibly non-perfect fields. We warmly thank the referee for insightful comments that motivated us to make our approach much more precise and comprehensive.</description>

      <title>On arborealization, Maslov data, and lack thereof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Weinstein manifold, we compare and contrast the properties of admitting an arboreal skeleton and admitting Maslov data. Both properties are implied by the existence of a polarization, for which a basic obstruction is that the odd Chern classes are 2-torsion. In a similar spirit we establish cohomological obstructions to the existence of arboreal skeleta and to the existence of Maslov data, exhibiting concrete examples to illustrate their failure. For instance, we show that complements of smooth anti-canonical divisors in complex projective space may fail to admit either arboreal skeleta or Maslov data. We also exhibit an example of a Weinstein manifold which admits Maslov data but does not admit an arboreal skeleton.</description>

      <title>How to build a Hopf algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a functor that inputs a retract in an $(\infty,3)$-category satisfying some adjunctibility conditions and outputs a Hopf algebra in a braided monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category. Provided the braided monoidal category is presentable, any Hopf algebra can be obtained in this way. Our functor specializes to - and provides a higher-categorical explanation for - the Tannakian reconstruction of a Hopf algebra from a monoidal category with duals and a fiber functor. Towards this end, we review and develop the lax (aka Gray) tensor product $\otimes$ of $(\infty,\infty)$-categories, and we analyze the "lax smash product" of pointed $(\infty,\infty)$-categories. We compute the lax-$\wedge$-square of the "walking adjunction" and show that its $3$-localization corepresents retracts with some adjunctibilty conditions, whereas the $3$-localization of the lax-$\wedge$-square of the "walking monad" corepresents bialgebras. In these terms, our functor is restriction along the lax-$\wedge$-square of the inclusion $\{\text{walking monad}\} \to \{\text{walking adjunction}\}$. After $3$-localization, we show that this restriction inverts a certain shear map, proving the existence of an antipode. We discuss generalizations of this construction to Hopf monads, analyze additional adjunctibility conditions and their interplay with integrals and cointegrals, and finally explain how variants of classical Tannakian reconstruction fit into our scheme.</description>
