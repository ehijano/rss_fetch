      <title>Star-Based Separators for Intersection Graphs of $c$-Colored Pseudo-Segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Planar Separator Theorem, which states that any planar graph $\mathcal{G}$ has a separator consisting of $O(\sqrt{n})$ nodes whose removal partitions $\mathcal{G}$ into components of size at most $\tfrac{2n}{3}$, is a widely used tool to obtain fast algorithms on planar graphs. Intersection graphs of disks, which generalize planar graphs, do not admit such separators. It has recently been shown that disk graphs do admit so-called clique-based separators that consist of $O(\sqrt{n})$ cliques. This result has been generalized to intersection graphs of various other types of disk-like objects. Unfortunately, segment intersection graphs do not admit small clique-based separators, because they can contain arbitrarily large bicliques. This is true even in the simple case of axis-aligned segments.
  In this paper we therefore introduce biclique-based separators (and, in particular, star-based separators), which are separators consisting of a small number of bicliques (or stars). We prove that any $c$-oriented set of $n$ segments in the plane, where $c$ is a constant, admits a star-based separator consisting of $O(\sqrt{n})$ stars. In fact, our result is more general, as it applies to any set of $n$ pseudo-segments that is partitioned into $c$ subsets such that the pseudo-segments in the same subset are pairwise disjoint. We extend our result to intersection graphs of $c$-oriented polygons. These results immediately lead to an almost-exact distance oracle for such intersection graphs, which has $O(n\sqrt{n})$ storage and $O(\sqrt{n})$ query time, and that can report the hop-distance between any two query nodes in the intersection graph with an additive error of at most 2. This is the first distance oracle for such types of intersection graphs that has subquadratic storage and sublinear query time and that only has an additive error.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Riemannian Metrics From Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05434</link>

Abstract: Random geometric graphs are random graph models defined on metric measure spaces. A random geometric graph is generated by first sampling points from a metric space and then connecting each pair of sampled points independently with a probability that depends on their distance.
  In recent work of Huang, Jiradilok, and Mossel~\cite{HJM24}, the authors study the problem of reconstructing an embedded manifold form a random geometric graph sampled from the manifold, where edge probabilities depend monotonically on the Euclidean distance between the embedded points. They show that, under mild regularity assumptions on the manifold, the sampling measure, and the connection probability function, it is possible to recover the pairwise Euclidean distances of the embedded sampled points up to a vanishing error as the number of vertices grows.
  In this work we consider a similar and arguably more natural problem where the metric is the Riemannian metric on the manifold. Again points are sampled from the manifold and a random graph is generated where the connection probability is monotone in the Riemannian distance. Perhaps surprisingly we obtain stronger results in this setup.
  Unlike the previous work that only considered dense graph we provide reconstruction algorithms from sparse graphs with average degree $n^{1/2}{\rm polylog}(n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices. Our algorithm is also a more efficient algorithm for distance reconstruction with improved error bounds. The running times of the algorithm is
  $O(n^2\,{\rm polylog}(n))$ which up to polylog factor matches the size of the input graph.
  Our distance error also nearly matches the volumetric lower bounds for distance estimation.</description>

      <title>An open-source heuristic to reboot 2D nesting research</title>

Abstract: 2D nesting problems rank among the most challenging cutting and packing problems. Yet, despite their practical relevance, research over the past decade has seen remarkably little progress. One reasonable explanation could be that nesting problems are already solved to near optimality, leaving little room for improvement. However, as our paper demonstrates, we are not at the limit after all. This paper presents $\texttt{sparrow}$, an open-source heuristic approach to solving 2D irregular strip packing problems, along with ten new real-world instances for benchmarking. Our approach decomposes the optimization problem into a sequence of feasibility problems, where collisions between items are gradually resolved. $\texttt{sparrow}$ consistently outperforms the state of the art - in some cases by an unexpectedly wide margin. We are therefore convinced that the aforementioned stagnation is better explained by both a high barrier to entry and a widespread lack of reproducibility. By releasing $\texttt{sparrow}$'s source code, we directly address both issues. At the same time, we are confident there remains significant room for further algorithmic improvement. The ultimate aim of this paper is not only to take a single step forward, but to reboot the research culture in the domain and enable continued, reproducible progress.</description>
