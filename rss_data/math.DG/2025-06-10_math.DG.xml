      <title>Hodge decomposition and Hard Lefschetz Condition on almost K\"{a}hler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the spaces of harmonic forms $\mathcal{H}^{\bullet}_{d}$ over a closed almost K\"{a}hler manifold $(X, J,\omega)$. We show that if the almost complex structure $J$ on the almost K\"{a}hler manifold $X$ is not too non-integrable in some sense, then the spaces $\mathcal{H}^{\bullet}_{d}$ have the Hodge decomposition $\mathcal{H}^{k}_{d}=\oplus_{p+q=k}\mathcal{H}^{p,q}_{d}$. As a consequence, the not too non-integrable almost complex structure $J$ is complex $C^{\infty}$-pure-and-full, and the Hard Lefschetz Condition (HLC) on $\mathcal{H}^{\bullet}_{d}$ is satisfied. Moreover, we can prove a rigidity result for the closed $4$-dimensional almost K\"{a}hler manifold with $b^{+}_{2}(X)\geq2$.</description>

      <title>A general model for time-minimizing navigation on a mountain slope under gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we solve the generalized Matsumoto's slope-of-a-mountain problem by means of Riemann-Finsler geometry, making close links with the Zermelo navigation problem. The time-minimizing navigation under gravity is analyzed in the general model of a slippery mountain slope being a Riemannian manifold. Both the transverse and longitudinal gravity-additives with respect to the direction of motion are admitted to vary simultaneously in the full ranges, showing the impact of cross- and along-traction on the slippery slope. By the anisotropic deformation of the background Riemannian metric and rigid translation with the use of the rescaled gravitational wind, we obtain the purely geometric solution for optimal navigation, which is given by a new Finsler metric belonging to the class of general $(\alpha, \beta)$-metrics. The related strong convexity conditions are established and time geodesics are described. Moreover, the evolution of time fronts and the behavior of time-minimizing trajectories in relation to various gravity effects on the slippery slope, gravitational wind force and direction of motion are thoroughly discussed and visualized by several two-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the curvature from random samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an estimator for the curvature of curves and surfaces by using finite sample points drawn from sampling a probability distribution that has support on the curve or surface. First we give an algorithm for estimation of the curvature in a given point of a curve. Then, we extend it to estimate the Gaussian curvature of the surfaces. In the proposed algorithms, we use a relation between the number of selected points in the point cloud and the probability that a given point has a suffcient number of nearby points. This relation allows us to control the required number of points in the point cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a marginally trapped submanifold $f:\Sigma^n\to M^{n+2}_1$ in a Lorentzian manifold $M^{n+2}_1$. We show that $f$ lies in a certain null hypersurface $\mathcal{N}_f^{n+1}$ in $M^{n+2}_1$ and $f$ has a locally volume-maximizing property in $\mathcal{N}^{n+1}_f$ if $M^{n+2}_1$ satisfies the null energy condition.</description>

      <title>Green functions and a positive mass theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new positive mass theorem for three-dimensional manifolds which are asymptotically hyperboloidal of order greater than $1$. The mass quantity under consideration is the volume-renormalized mass recently introduced in a paper by Dahl, McCormick and the first author. The proof is based on a monotonicity formula holding along the level sets of the Green function for the Laplace operator centered at an arbitrary point. In order for this argument to work out, we require that the second homology of the manifold does not contain any spherical classes.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence of graph Laplacians with Ricci curvature bounds and in non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes quantitative high-probability bounds on the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\epsilon$-neighborhood graph Laplacians constructed from i.i.d. random variables on $m$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ that satisfy a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound $\operatorname{Ric}_g\ge -(m-1)K$, a positive lower volume bound, and an upper diameter bound. These results extend to non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces that are measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits of such manifolds, and the bounds give a spectral approximation of weighted Laplacians on manifolds with non-smooth points.</description>

      <title>Codimension-Two Spacelike Submanifolds with Umbilical Lightlike Normal Sections and Their Relationship to Lightlike Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study codimension-two spacelike submanifolds in Lorentzian spacetimes that admit umbilical lightlike normal directions. We show that such submanifolds are subject to strong geometric and topological constraints, establishing explicit relationships between extrinsic geometry, mean curvature, and shear-isotropy. In the compact case, we obtain sharp restrictions on their topology. We precisely characterize when the umbilical lightlike normal direction can be rescaled to be parallel, in terms of the normal connection and the conformal structure of the ambient spacetime. Our main result is a factorization theorem: any such submanifold is contained in a lightlike hypersurface, which is totally umbilical whenever the lightlike normal direction is umbilical. We also provide explicit conformal relations between the induced metrics on the family of spacelike leaves generated by the lightlike normal flow, with consequences for isometry, parallelism of lightlike normal directions, volume evolution, and variational properties. These results yield a detailed geometric framework relevant to the mathematical study of horizons and lightlike structures in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry in Geometric Constraints: Analytic and Riemann-Roch Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon the discovery of mirror symmetry phenomena in compatible pair Spencer complexes, this paper develops rigorous analytical foundations through systematic application of elliptic perturbation theory and characteristic class analysis. We establish a comprehensive multi-level framework revealing the mathematical mechanisms underlying the symbolic transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$: metric invariance analysis via Spencer metric theory, topological isomorphisms through elliptic operator perturbation methods, and algebraic geometric equivalences via GAGA principle and characteristic class machinery.
  Main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of Spencer-Hodge Laplacian perturbation relations and cohomological mirror isomorphisms using Fredholm theory; (2) Complete characteristic class equivalence theorems establishing algebraic geometric foundations for mirror symmetry; (3) Systematic Spencer-Riemann-Roch decomposition formulas with explicit error estimates on Calabi-Yau manifolds; (4) Computational verification frameworks demonstrated on elliptic curves.
  This research demonstrates that mirror symmetry in constraint geometry possesses deep analytical structure accessible through modern elliptic theory and algebraic geometry, establishing Spencer complexes as a bridge between constraint analysis and contemporary geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Quantization commutes with reduction for coisotropic A-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a Hamiltonian $G$-manifold $X$, we define the notion of $G$-invariance of coisotropic A-branes $\mathcal{B}$. Under neat assumptions, we give a Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer type construction of a coisotropic A-brane $\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{red}}$ on $X // G$ from $\mathcal{B}$, recovering the usual construction when $\mathcal{B}$ is Lagrangian. For a canonical coisotropic A-brane $\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}$ on a holomorphic Hamiltonian $G_\mathbb{C}$-manifold $X$, there is a fibration of $(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})_{\operatorname{red}}$ over $X // G_\mathbb{C}$.
  We also show that `intersections of A-branes commute with reduction'. When $X = T^*M$ for $M$ being compact K\"ahler with a Hamiltonian $G$-action, Guillemin-Sternberg `quantization commutes with reduction' theorem can be interpreted as $\operatorname{Hom}_{X // G}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{red}}, (\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})_{\operatorname{red}}) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_X(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})^G$ with $\mathcal{B} = M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07130v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow for both finite and infinite ideal circle patterns. In the finite case, we establish a sharp criterion: the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow with $p&gt;1$ converges if and only if a constant curvature metric exists in the underlying geometric background. In the infinite setting, we prove the long-time existence of solutions to the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow for $p \geq 2$, representing a significant advance in the theory of curvature flows on infinite structures.</description>

      <title>Dirac spectral flow and Floer theory of hyperbolic three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between hyperbolic geometry and monopole Floer homology for a closed oriented three-manifold $Y$ with $b_1=1$ equipped with a torsion spin$^c$ structure $\mathfrak{s}$. We show that, under favorable circumstances, one can completely describe the Floer theory of $(Y,\mathfrak{s})$ purely in terms of geometric data such as the lengths and holonomies of closed geodesics. In particular, we perform the first computations of monopole Floer chain complexes with non-trivial homology for hyperbolic three-manifolds. The examples we consider admit no irreducible solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations, and the non-triviality of the Floer homology groups is a consequence of the geometry of the $1$-parameter family of Dirac operators associated to flat spin$^c$ connections. The main technical challenge is to understand explicitly how the Dirac eigenvalues with small absolute value cross the value zero in this family; we tackle this using Fourier analytic tools via the corresponding $1$-parameter family of odd Selberg trace formulas and its derivative.</description>

      <title>Spencer Differential Degeneration Theory and Its Applications in Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the compatible pair theory of principal bundle constraint systems, this paper discovers and establishes a complete Spencer differential degeneration theory. We prove that when symmetric tensors satisfy a $\lambda$-dependent kernel condition $\delta_{\mathfrak{g}}^{\lambda}(s)=0$, the Spencer differential degenerates to the standard exterior differential, thus establishing a precise bridge between the complex Spencer theory and the classical de Rham theory. One of the advances in this paper is the rigorous proof that this degeneration condition remains stable under mirror transformations, revealing the profound symmetry origins of this phenomenon. Based on these rigorous mathematical results, we construct a canonical mapping from degenerate Spencer cocycles to de Rham cohomology and elucidate its geometric meaning. Finally, we demonstrate the application potential of this theory in algebraic geometry, particularly on K3 surfaces, where we preliminarily verify that this framework can systematically identify (1,1)-Hodge classes satisfying algebraicity conditions. This work provides new perspectives and technical approaches for studying algebraic invariants using tools from constraint geometry.</description>

Abstract: In 1917, Hardy and Ramanujan showed that if $\omega(n)$ is the number of distinct prime factors of a randomly chosen positive integer $n,$ then the normal order of $\omega(n)$ is $\log \log \, n.$ This led Erd\H{o}s and Kac to prove their celebrated result showing a Gaussian behaviour for $\omega(n).$ In this article we prove an Erd\H{o}s-Kac kind result for the number of scattering geodesics on the modular surface with a common sojourn time.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernel on Warped Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the scalar Laplacian on a $n$-dimen\-sional warped product manifold $M=\Sigma\times_f N$ with a $(n-1)$-dimensional compact manifold $N$ without boundary, a one dimensional manifold $\Sigma$ without boundary and a warping function $f\in C^\infty(\Sigma)$. We consider two cases: $\Sigma=S^1$ when the manifold $M$ is compact, and $\Sigma=\mathbb{R}$ when the manifold $M$ is non-compact. In the latter case we assume that the warping function $f$ is such that the manifold $M$ has two cusps with a finite volume. In particular, we study the case of the warping function $f(y)=[\cosh(y/b)]^{-2\nu/(n-1)}$ in detail, where $y\in\mathbb{R}$ and $b$ and $\nu$ are some positive parameters. We study the properties of the spectrum of the Laplacian in detail and show that it has both the discrete and the continuous spectrum. We compute the resolvent, the eigenvalues, the scattering matrix, the heat kernel and the regularized heat trace.

      <description>arXiv:2506.07674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use properties of symplectic capacities that were recently defined by Hutchings to obtain upper bounds on the minimal action of Reeb orbits on fiberwise star-shaped hypersurfaces $\Sigma \subset T^*S^2$. In addition, we introduce the notion of a fiberwise $\beta$-balanced hypersurface $\Sigma \subset T^*S^2$ and establish upper bounds for the systole in terms of $\beta$ and geometric data, in the case of Riemannian metrics on $S^2$ satisfying this property. Finally, under the assumption of antipodal symmetry, we provide a non-sharp estimate of how fiberwise balanced a $\delta$-pinched metric is.</description>

      <title>Horizontal Descent, Immersions, Unramified Morphisms, Submersions, \'Etale Morphisms and the Relative Cotangent Sequence in Tangent Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a deep and systematic study of the classes of what it means to be an immersion, a submersion, a local diffeomorphism, and unramified in a tangent category. We also give a systematic study of the ways in which these classes of morphisms interact, the properties they have, and give very explicit and concrete characterizations of how each class of maps appear in algebraic geometry, in differential geometry, in the theory of semirings, and in the theory of Cartesian differential categories. Additionally, we discuss the notion of being carrable with respect to the tangent bundle projection, then use this to define the notion of horizontal descent in a tangent category, which we then use as a key tool to study the aforementioned classes of morphisms. We in particular use this to define a de Rham relative cotangent complex in an arbitrary tangent category and to give a partial answer of when it is that a submersion admits not just a section but a section which is linear.</description>

      <title>The group of affine transformations of homogeneous spaces with discrete isotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.02575v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to compute the group of affine transformations of a homogeneous $G$-space under specific conditions: when the group $G$ and the homogeneous $G$-space admit linear connections so that the natural projection is affine, and with discrete isotropy group. If $G$ admits a bi-invariant linear connection, we establish conditions under which the homogeneous space admits an invariant linear connection. As a consequence, when the isotropy group is discrete, their respective groups of affine transformations are locally isomorphic. As an application of our work, we calculate the group of the affine transformations of orientable flat affine surfaces and 3-dimensional flat affine tori.</description>

      <title>Gaussian curvature conjecture for minimal graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14687v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the longstanding Gaussian curvature conjecture of a minimal graph $S$ over the unit disk. The conjecture asserts that for any minimal graph above the unit disk, the Gaussian curvature at the point directly above the origin satisfies the sharp inequality \( |\mathcal{K}| &lt; \frac{\pi^2}{2} \). We first reduce the conjecture to the problem of estimating the Gaussian curvature of certain Scherk-type minimal surfaces defined over bicentric quadrilaterals inscribed in the unit disk, containing the origin. We then provide a sharp estimate for the Gaussian curvature of these minimal surfaces at the point above the origin. Our proof employs complex-analytic methods, as the minimal surfaces in question allow a conformal harmonic parameterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an entire $C^2$ function $u$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, we consider the graph of $D u$ as a Lagrangian submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, and deform it by the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. This leads to the special Lagrangian evolution equation, a fully nonlinear Hessian type PDE. We prove long-time existence and convergence results under a 2-positivity assumption of $(I+(D^2 u)^2)^{-1}D^2 u$. Such results were previously known only under the stronger assumption of positivity of $D^2 u$.</description>

      <title>Flows of SU(2)-structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper initiates a classification programme of flows of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-structures on $4$-manifolds which have short-time existence and uniqueness. Our approach adapts a representation-theoretic method originally due to Bryant in the context of $\mathrm{G}_2$ geometry. We show how this strategy can also be used to deduce the number of geometric flows of a given $H$-structure; we illustrate this in the $\mathrm{G}_2$, $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ cases. Our investigation also leads us to derive explicit expressions for the Ricci and self-dual Weyl curvature in terms of the intrinsic torsion of the underlying $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-structure. We compute the first variation formulae of all the quadratic functionals in the torsion; these provide natural building blocks for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gradient flows. In particular, our results demonstrate that both the negative gradient flow of the Dirichlet energy of the intrinsic torsion and the Ricci harmonic flow are parabolic after a modified DeTurck's trick.</description>

Abstract: In this article we classify totally geodesic submanifolds of homogeneous nearly K\"ahler 6-manifolds, and of the G2-cones over these 6-manifolds. To this end, we develop new techniques for the study of totally geodesic submanifolds of analytic Riemannian manifolds, naturally reductive homogeneous spaces, and Riemannian cones. In particular, we obtain an example of a totally geodesic submanifold with self-intersections in a simply connected homogeneous space.</description>

      <title>On some critical Riemannian metrics and Thorpe-type conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \((M, g)\) be a compact, closed Riemannian manifold of dimension \(n\), and let \(k\) be an integer such that \(2 \leq 2k \leq n\). Denote by \(R^k\) the \(k\)-th Thorpe tensor, defined as the \(k\)-fold exterior product of the Riemann curvature tensor \(R\). We consider the geometric functionals $ H_{2k}(g) := \int_M \operatorname{tr}(R^k) \, \mathrm{dvol}_g$ and $ G_{2k}(g) :=\int_M \|R^k\|^2 \, \mathrm{dvol}_g,$ where \(\operatorname{tr}(R^k)\) denotes the full contraction (trace) of \(R^k\). For \(k = 1\), \(H_2(g)\) coincides with the Hilbert--Einstein functional, while \(G_2(g)\) is the \(L^2\)-norm of the Riemann curvature tensor.
  We derive the first variation formulas for \(H_{2k}\) and \(G_{2k}\), and study some properties of their critical points. In particular, we prove that an Einstein metric is critical for \(G_2\) if and only if it is critical for \(H_4\). More generally, we show that a hyper-\((2k)\)-Einstein metric is critical for \(G_{2k}\) if and only if it is critical for \(H_{4k}\).
  We further introduce and study two new classes of Riemannian metrics: the \((2k)\)-Thorpe and \((2k)\)-anti-Thorpe metrics, defined via self-duality and anti-self-duality conditions on the Thorpe tensor \(R^k\), respectively. In dimension \(n = 4k\), we show that both types are critical for \(G_{2k}\). In higher dimensions (\(n &gt; 4k\)), the same duality conditions imply that $R^k$ is harmonic. Under additional positivity assumptions on the Riemann tensor, we further deduce rigidity results for such metrics.</description>

Abstract: Volume comparison theorem is a type of fundamental results in Riemannian geometry. In this article, we extend the volume comparison result in \cite{Besse2008} to the comparison of total $\sigma_l$-curvature with respect to $\sigma_k$-curvature ($l&lt;k$). In particular, we prove the comparison holds for metrics close to strictly stable positive Einstein metric with $l&lt;\frac{n}{2}$. As for negative Einstein metrics, we prove a similar comparison result provided certain assumptions on sectional curvature holds for the manifold.</description>

      <title>Structural Validation Of Synthetic Power Distribution Networks Using The Multiscale Flat Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of comparing a pair of geometric networks that may not be similarly defined, i.e., when they do not have one-to-one correspondences between their nodes and edges. Our motivating application is to compare power distribution networks of a region. Due to the lack of openly available power network datasets, researchers synthesize realistic networks resembling their actual counterparts. But the synthetic digital twins may vary significantly from one another and from actual networks due to varying underlying assumptions and approaches. Hence the user wants to evaluate the quality of networks in terms of their structural similarity to actual power networks. But the lack of correspondence between the networks renders most standard approaches, e.g., subgraph isomorphism and edit distance, unsuitable.
  We propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate through 2D examples that the flat norm distance can capture the variations of inputs more accurately than the commonly used Hausdorff distance. As a notion of stability, we also derive upper bounds on the flat norm distance between a simple 1D curve and its perturbed version as a function of the radius of perturbation for a restricted class of perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of tangent cones to area minimizing currents at boundaries with arbitrary multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an area minimizing current $T$ in a $C^2$ submanifold $\Sigma$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$, with arbitrary integer boundary multiplicity $\partial T = Q [\![ \Gamma ]\!]$ where $\Gamma$ is a $C^2$ submanifold of $\Sigma$. We show that at every density $Q/2$ boundary point the tangent cone to $T$ is unique and there is a power rate of convergence to the unique tangent cone.
  In particular, if $\Gamma$ is a closed manifold which lies at the boundary of a uniformly convex set $\Omega$ and $\Sigma=\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ then $T$ has a unique tangent cone at every boundary point.
  As a structural consequence of the uniqueness of the tangent cone, we obtain a decomposition theorem which is the starting point of the boundary regularity theory we develop in another paper in collaboration with Reinaldo Resende. The regularity theory we obtain generalizes Allard's boundary regularity theorem to a higher multiplicity setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal transportation problem on a globally hyperbolic spacetime for some cost function $c_2$, which corresponds to the optimal transportation problem on a complete Riemannian manifold where the cost function is the Riemannian distance squared. Building on insights from previous studies on the Riemannian and Lorentzian case, our main goal is to investigate the regularity of $\pi$-solutions (weak versions of Kantorovich potentials), from which we can conclude, in a classical way, the existence, uniqueness and structure of an optimal transport map between given Borel probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$, under suitable assumptions.</description>
