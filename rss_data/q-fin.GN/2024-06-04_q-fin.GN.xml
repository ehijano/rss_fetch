      <title>A Geometric Approach To Asset Allocation With Investor Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, a geometric approach to incorporating investor views in portfolio construction is presented. In particular, the proposed approach utilizes the notion of generalized Wasserstein barycenter (GWB) to combine the statistical information about asset returns with investor views to obtain an updated estimate of the asset drifts and covariance, which are then fed into a mean-variance optimizer as inputs. Quantitative comparisons of the proposed geometric approach with the conventional Black-Litterman model (and a closely related variant) are presented. The proposed geometric approach provides investors with more flexibility in specifying their confidence in their views than conventional Black-Litterman model-based approaches. The geometric approach also rewards the investors more for making correct decisions than conventional BL based approaches. We provide empirical and theoretical justifications for our claim.</description>

      <title>Not feeling the buzz: Correction study of mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a replication and correction of a recent article (Ramirez, P., Reade, J.J., Singleton, C., Betting on a buzz: Mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks, International Journal of Forecasting, 39:3, 2023, pp. 1413-1423, doi: 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2022.07.011). RRS measure profile page views on Wikipedia to generate a "buzz factor" metric for tennis players and show that it can be used to form a profitable gambling strategy by predicting bookmaker mispricing. Here, we use the same dataset as RRS to reproduce their results exactly, thus confirming the robustness of their mispricing claim. However, we discover that the published betting results are significantly affected by a single bet (the "Hercog" bet), which returns substantial outlier profits based on erroneously long odds. When this data quality issue is resolved, the majority of reported profits disappear and only one strategy, which bets on "competitive" matches, remains significantly profitable in the original out-of-sample period. While one profitable strategy offers weaker support than the original study, it still provides an indication that market inefficiencies may exist, as originally claimed by RRS. As an extension, we continue backtesting after 2020 on a cleaned dataset. Results show that (a) the "competitive" strategy generates no further profits, potentially suggesting markets have become more efficient, and (b) model coefficients estimated over this more recent period are no longer reliable predictors of bookmaker mispricing. We present this work as a case study demonstrating the importance of replication studies in sports forecasting, and the necessity to clean data. We open-source release comprehensive datasets and code.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Granular Models of Firm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit granular models that represent the size of a firm as the sum of the sizes of multiple constituents or sub-units. Originally developed to address the unexpectedly slow reduction in volatility as firm size increases, these models also explain the shape of the distribution of firm growth rates.
  We introduce new theoretical insights regarding the relationship between firm size and growth rate statistics within this framework, directly linking the growth statistics of a firm to how diversified it is. The non-intuitive nature of our results arises from the fat-tailed distributions of the size and the number of sub-units, which suggest the categorization of firms into three distinct diversification types: well-diversified firms with sizes evenly distributed across many sub-units, firms with many sub-units but concentrated size in just a few, and poorly diversified firms consisting of only a small number of sub-units.
  Inspired by our theoretical findings, we identify new empirical patterns in firm growth. Our findings show that growth volatility, when adjusted by average size-conditioned volatility, has a size-independent distribution, but with a tail that is much too thin to be in agreement with the predictions of granular models. Furthermore, the predicted Gaussian distribution of growth rates, even when rescaled for firm-specific volatility, remains fat-tailed across all sizes. Such discrepancies not only challenge the granularity hypothesis but also underscore the need for deeper exploration into the mechanisms driving firm growth.</description>
